INTRODUCTION \
\
\
senega\'92s life \
\
Lucius Annaeus Seneca was bom at Cordoba, then the \
leading town in Roman Spain, at about the same time as \
Christd His father, Marcus Annaeus Seneca, was an imperial \
procurator^ who became an authority on rhetoric, the art of \
public speaking and debate.^ He was the father not only of \
our Seneca, who speaks of his \'91old-fashioned strictness \
but also of Novatus, later knowm as GaUio, the governor of \
Achaea who declined to exercise jurisdiction over St Paul \
(Acts XVin, II-17), and of Mela, less ambitious than his \
brothers but an able financier (and father of the brilhant young \
poet Lucan). \
\
Seneca suffered severely from ill health, particularly asthma, \
throughout his life; he tells us that at one time the only thing \
which held him back from committing suicide was the \
thought of his father\'92s inability to bear the loss.^ He spent a \
period of his early life in Egypt (where the husband of a \
devoted aunt named Marcia was the viceroy \'91of the emperor \
Tiberius from a.d. 16 to 31), there acquiring experience in \
matters of administration and finance. He also studied the \
geography and ethnology of Egypt and India\'ae and developed a \
lasting interest in natural science, speculative rather than \
empirical (although Pliny speaks of him as an authority on \
geplogy, marine life and meteorology, and others have \
admired his remarks on, for example, evolution or the ex- \
planation of rings roimd the sxm). His interest was drawn at \
an early age to Pythagorean mysticism and various cults of \
eastern origin then gaining adherents in Rome, before his \
final acceptance, in large part, of the Stoic philosophy. \

INTRODUCTION \
\
\
After training for the bar he took successfully to public \
life, becoming quaestor in spite of the handicaps of his \
health, his foreign background and comparative lack of \
family or other connexions. When Caligula succeeded Tiberius \
in A.D. 37, Seneca had become a leading speaker in the \
Senate, and so aroused the jealousy\'92 of the new emperor that \
according to Dio Cassius he ordered his execution and was \
only induced to let him off by a woman close to the imperial \
throne who said that Seneca was \'91suffering from advanced \
tuberculosis and it would not be long before he died\'92.\'ae This \
incident apparently resulted in his temporary retirement from \
political affairs. \
\
In A.D. 41, in the first year of the reign of Caligula\'92s \
successor, Claudius, Seneca again came imder sentence of \
death - commuted to banishment - for reasons which we do \
not know. The pretext was adultery with Julia Livilla, the \
late emperor\'92s sister; the more likely explanation\'ae is that the \
new ruler\'92s consort, the notorious Messalina, considered him \
dangerous. His exile on the island of Corsica does not seem \
to have been endured as stoically as it might have been. The \
encouraging spirit of an essay of consolation sent to his dearly \
loved mother Helvia is entirely absent in another addressed \
to Polybius, an ex-slave who had become a trusted servant of \
the emperor, which contains some abject flattery and was \
probably never meant to be published. He had by now suffered \
the loss not only of his father but of a son, and his first wife \
died while he was away. The only solace for him in these \
eight long years of loneliness and near, despair was the \
reception given to the poems, tragedies and essays to fiiends \
which he continued composing during his banishment. \
\
His fortunes turned dramatically in A.D. 49. Messalina had \
been executed and the emperor\'92s new wife, Agrippina, had \
Seneca recalled to Rome, appointed to the high office of \
praetor and made tutor to her twelve-year-old son Lucius \
\
\
\

\
\
Domitius Ahenobarbus (the boy wlio was shortly to become \
the emperor Nero). Agrippina's motives, according to \
Tacitus, apart from the instruction of her son, were a confi- \
dence that because of his \'91literary fame\'92 die move would \
gain them popularity, and a belief that he would prove a \
reliable ally and a useful adviser to herself and Nero in their \
plans for future power.^\'b0 \
\
There is no evidence that Seneca was connected with the \
poisoning of Claudius in a.d. 54. But he wrote the speeches \
wliich the seventeen-year-old Nero delivered after his \
accession, and was probably the author of a witty, if to us a \
little tasteless, attack on the dead ruler\'92s memory (the \
Apocolocytitosis or \'91Pumpkinification\'92, an imaginary tale of \
the rebuffs received by the recently deceased emperor when \
he presents himself at the portals of Heaven and his applica- \
tion for admission is debated by the Gods). Nero did make a- \
formal speech in honour of his predecessor, which was said \
to display \'91a great deal of polish\'92 and to be a good example of \
Seneca\'92s \'91attractive style, well tuned to the ears of his time\'92.^^ \
\
The new regime opened well and \'91Nero\'92s first five years\'92 \
were later spoken of as a period of unequalled good govern- \
ment, the emperor Trajan even calling them the finest period \
in the history of imperial Rome.^^ For this Rome was in-, \
debted to Seneca and an army officer named Burrus. These \
two, \'91the most influential as well as the most enlightened of \
the men who surroimded Nero\'92 (Dio),^^ \'91whose, wide \
experience was conmion knowledge\'92 (Tacitus),\'92^*\'92\'92 prevented \
the hot-headed yormg man from carrying out a lot of murders \
on his accession and aimed at chaimelling some of his energies \
into \'91permissible pleasures\'92.^\'ae Only briefly alarmed by the \
, poisoiung of Britannicus and acting throughout in complete \
harmony they succeeded in keeping public business out of \
Agrippina\'92s hands and in their own., Tacitus ascribes the \
secret of the influence of Seneca to \'91his tuition of Nero in \

public speaking, and his engaging manners and high princi- \
ples , that of Burrus to \'91his military responsibilities and \
austerity of character\'92/\'ae \
\
The two of them \'91took over total power, and exercised it, \
to the utmost of their ability, in the best and justest way \
conceivable, thus each alike" arousing all men\'92s approval\'92 \
(Dio)/\'92\'92' While Nero amused himself they set about the \
problems of government; we notice - to give instances of \
their activity - legal and financial reforms including the \
reduction of indirect taxation and steps to prevent peculation \
and extortion by provincial governors, and the prosecution of \
a successful war in Armenia to settle the empire\'92s eastern \
firontier. Seneca\'92s geographical interests appear in the dis- \
patch of an expedition \'91to investigate the soinrce of the \
Nile , Yet another of his interests was shorthand, the Roman \
system of which he is said to have completely revised. \
\
Neither he nor , Burrus appears to have held any standing \
legal or constitutional office that could be said to give them \
the authority they wielded during these years. Seneca, \'91the \
real master of the world seems simply to have been the \
moving force behind the throne. It is probably safe to say \
that Nero (unlike Aristotle\'92s celebrated pupil at a similar age, \
Alexander the Great) was still imder the influence of a \
teacher of imdoubted personal charm, and was quite content \
to leave to him the direction of affairs in which he had little \
real interest. Once the yoimg emperor began to hsten to \
other advisers and increasingly to indulge his more violent \
and vindictive impulses this happy situation was doomed. \
\
In A.D. 58 Seneca was being attacked by people like \
Publius Suilhus Rufus.^^ Accusations seem to have ranged in \
gravity from sleeping with the emperor\'92s mother (obviously \
the man had failed to learn his lesson from his \'91thoroughly \
deserved\'92 banishment for \'91seducing imperial princesses ) and \
the introduction of the emperor to paederasty, to the use- \

lessness of his studies and the affectedness of his oratorical \
style. But the campaign against him generally centred on \
the apparent contrast - it has been a stock criticism of Seneca \
right down the centuries - betw-een his philosophical teach- \
ings and his practice. Instances of tliis hypocrisy, according to \
Suillius, were the philosopher\'92s denunciations of tyranny, \
which did not stop him from being tutor to a tyrant; of \
flattery, ill according with the attitude he had adopted, \
especially from exile, towards ex-slaves who headed depart- \
ments in Claudius\'92 administration; , of extravagance, in spite \
of (allegedly) giving banquets served at five hundred identical \
