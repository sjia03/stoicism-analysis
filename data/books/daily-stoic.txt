INTRODUCTION

i

n his tent at the front near the Granua River in the distant territory
of Germania, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius rose at dawn. It was a
struggle for him to get up this early, but he did anyway; his job required
it. In the lamplight, he sat at the table and began to write in Greek in
his journal about what the day ahead held in store for him. “I will
encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and
cranks,” he wrote to himself, preparing mentally for the inevitable
difficulties of the life of an emperor, particularly one faced with leading
an army and overseeing the empire from abroad.
But don’t assume this was a complaint. There was not a note of
frustration or resentment in his tone.
Marcus Aurelius was practicing with pleasure the philosophy he’d
come to love and depend on, Stoicism. He was not writing off his fellow
men and his subjects. On the contrary, in the completion of that
thought, he would say of those busybodies and ingrates “that none can
do me harm, or implicate me in ugliness—nor can I be angry at my
relatives or hate them. For we are made for cooperation.” And so he
went about the rest of his morning journaling, writing little notes for
himself on how to think, how to live, what to be grateful for, and then
he proceeded on to meet the day, not simply as a philosopher, but as a
true philosopher king.
If we can go back in time a little further, almost exactly one century
and one evening before Marcus’s morning meditation, we’d find
another Stoic philosopher doing something quite similar. His name
was Seneca, and he was alternatively a powerbroker, a playwright, and
public intellectual serving at the highest levels in the court of Nero.
Instead of journaling in the morning, he preferred to do his at night,
putting, as he said, each day up for review. Seneca would look back on
the day just then coming to a close and ask himself whether his actions
had been just, what he could have done better, what habits he could
curb, how he might improve himself. “We reflect upon that which we
are about to do,” he would tell his older brother about this nightly
routine, “and yet our plans for the future descend from the past.”

INTRODUCTION

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

Reviewing the previous day is what helped Seneca prepare for the one
that he would face the following morning.
Epictetus, another famous Stoic, was a former slave who lived a life
not nearly as cushy or powerful as Seneca or Marcus, and would
repeatedly remind his students to rehearse their lessons, to write them
down for their own use. In Discourses, he says, “Every day and night
keep thoughts like these at hand—write them, read them aloud, talk
to yourself and others about them.”
These then, the morning preparation and the evening review, are
two of the most essential and intertwining exercises in Stoic philoso­
phy and a tradition now more than two thousand years old. It’s a tra­
dition that you, in holding The Daily Stoic Journal, are now an heir to
and can continue twice per day in your pursuit of the good life.
Unlike many other philosophies, Stoicism wasn’t designed simply to
be some explanation of the universe. It wasn’t overly interested in com­
plicated questions about where we came from or theoretical discus­
sions of this issue or that one. Stoicism was designed by the Greeks and
perfected by the Romans for the living and the doing of daily life for
the man and woman trying to make it in a confusing world. As such,
it was much more than a set of teachings or long-ago written sentences.
It was instead a set of timeless practical exercises—systems for reduc­
ing fear, thoughts for battling destructive thoughts, reminders of things
we take for granted, tools for resisting temptation, pillars of strength
for tough moments. This meant that Stoicism wasn’t something to be
learned once or read once. It was meant to be studied and practiced.
Consider the title of Marcus Aurelius’s only work, Meditations. He
was meditating, to himself, for himself, on the philosophic principles
he was still learning and practicing even in old age. A peek at Seneca’s
letters finds the same thing—he is writing to someone else, yes, but
clearly the intended audience is also himself. He is thinking out loud.
Epictetus, too, survives in the form of notes written by his student
Arrian, and they read as if his day was spent trying to answer the end­
less questions of his students: What do I do about this? How can I
handle something like that? Any advice for when I
?
In our book The Daily Stoic, we tried to bring a collection of this
wisdom to busy readers in a digestible and accessible way. Instead of
translating and republishing the Stoics in their original form (which
has been done quite well, many times), we created the first ever single-

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

INTRODUCTION

volume collection of all the great Stoics, arranged to highlight a thought
from one each day. The response to the book was humbling and surpris­
ing. The book spent three months on the national bestseller lists and
debuted in the form of a keynote address at what was likely the largest
single gathering of Stoics in two thousand years. Our accompanying
daily e-mail at DailyStoic.com was inundated with sign-ups, meaning
that each morning tens of thousands of aspiring Stoics were all reading
the same thing at the same time. We also began to see photos online
from readers who had filled up the pages of The Daily Stoic and Moleskine journals with thoughts inspired by each day’s meditation.
In response, we set out to create this journal, a companion guide to
The Daily Stoic and a resource to anyone trying to practice the philos­
ophy. We’re honored that you now hold it in your hands.
HOW TO USE THIS JOURNAL
This book presents fifty-two Stoic disciplines or practices, one for each
week of the year. Each practice is presented with some direction about
its significance and application, along with a few quotes from the great
Stoics to help focus your attention on the practice for the week—the
first quote about each weekly practice is taken directly from that same
week in The Daily Stoic. Each day presents a question to help you focus
your morning preparations or evening review (or both). The questions
will work for you whether you are reading along with The Daily Stoic,
using our daily e-mail readings, or any other source.
We have not written a set of commandments or a step-by-step sys­
tem that must be adhered to unthinkingly (if you don’t want to respond
to the prompts, ignore them and write about whatever you feel would
be most beneficial. We also have suggestions at the back for other
sources to use). As Seneca said: “The ones who pioneered these paths
aren’t our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone; it
hasn’t been monopolized.”
The reason these Stoic practices have been so enduring (and are
enjoying a modern-day resurgence) is that they are relentlessly focused
on the situations that we face on a daily basis, what Richard Sorabji
calls “the ordinary ups and downs of life, on bereavement, loss of
office, promotion, the rat race, money, invasions, the sacking of cities,
exile, worries about health.” As the American philosopher Brand Blanshard marveled at Marcus Aurelius’s legacy:

INTRODUCTION

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

“Few care now about the marches and countermarches of the
Roman commanders. What the centuries have clung to is a note­
book of thoughts by a man whose real life was largely unknown
who put down in the midnight dimness not the events of the day
or the plans of the morrow, but something of far more permanent
interest, the ideals and aspirations that a rare spirit lived by.”
The Roman Stoics focused not on words, but action. As Seneca
memorably put it, “Philosophy teaches us how to act, not how to talk.”
This bias toward improving our actions on a daily basis was something
Epictetus made central to his teaching, summarized in his warning
“not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then
training.”
This journal is a place to focus your attention (prosoche) and prac­
tice (melete) as you try to remember and apply what you are learning
on the path to progress (prokope). When you pursue the Stoic disci­
plines presented in this journal, each morning you will ask, as the great
modern Stoic Pierre Hadot put it, “What principles will guide and
inspire my actions?” And each evening you will examine where you fell
short of those principles, as well as where you have made progress. You
can begin on any calendar date you choose and proceed until the book
is complete.
Together, the fifty-two ideals and aspirations offer something for
every situation. Whether it’s dealing with bad habits like complaining
(Week XXXI), procrastination (Week XXXV), or panic (Week XXXIX),
or finding less destructive alternatives to anger (Week XXIX), fear of
the future (Week XXXIV), or dealing with haters (Week XXXVIII),
you will find practical tools to put to use. You will gain powerful per­
spective by learning the exercise of taking “the view from above”
(Week XXII), or learning to see things as others do (Week XI), and by
taking on a role model (Week XXIII). You’ll train yourself in the Stoic
basics like the dichotomy of control (Week I), focus on the present
moment (Week V), or how to test your impressions (Week XV).
It’s important to remember this isn’t a contest to see if you can live
like some perfect sage or escape the correction of someone farther along
the path than you. Anyone who uses philosophy that way is decidedly
un-Stoic! As Seneca reminded us, “Let philosophy scrape off your own
faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.” Think

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

INTRODUCTION

of this journal as a brush for your own soul, just like brushing your
teeth each morning and each evening.
The final lesson at the end of this book is the most essential one of
all of Stoic philosophy: learning how to turn words into works. We
hope you will make it that far, and if you do, we encourage you to start
the same journey once again the following year, for you will be, as
Heraclitus said, no longer the same person nor will this be the same
book.

WEEK I
WHAT’S UP TO US, WHAT’S NOT UP TO US

r pictetus’s handbook (the Enchiridion) begins with the most powerL— ful exercise in all of Stoicism: the distinction between the things
that are “up to us” (in our control) and the things that are “not up to
us.” It is this, the dichotomy of control, that is the first principle in the
entire philosophy. We don’t control many of the things we pursue in
life—yet we become angry, sad, hurt, scared, or jealous when we don’t
get them. In fact, those emotions—those reactions—are about the only
thing that we do control. If that is the only lesson you journal about or
remember for this year, consider it a year well and philosophically
lived.
“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate mat­
ters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not
under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actu­
ally control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to
uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are
my own . ..”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.5.4-5

“Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control
our opinion, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything
of our own doing. We don’t control our body, property, reputa­
tion, position, and, in a word, everything not of our own doing.
Even more, the things in our control are by nature free, unhin­
dered, and unobstructed, while those not in our control are weak,
slavish, can be hindered, and are not our own.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion 1.1-2

“We control our reasoned choice and all acts that depend on that
moral will. What’s not under our control are the body and any of
its parts, our possessions, parents, siblings, children, or country—
anything with which we might associate.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.22.10

THE SPHERE OF CHOICE

i

f the first step is to discern what is or isn’t in our control, the second
is to focus our energy on the things we have a choice about. The Sto­
ics viewed the soul as a sphere that, when well tuned, well directed,
was an invincible fortress against any trial or circumstance. Protected
by our reason, this sphere of choice (prohairesis) is like a sacred temple
and is the only thing we truly possess in life. We are the product of our
choices, so it is essential then that we choose well. This week, consider
and reflect on the choices you have: about your emotions, your actions,
your beliefs, and your priorities.
“Keep this thought at the ready at daybreak, and through the day
and night—there is only one path to happiness, and that is in
giving up all outside of your sphere of choice, regarding nothing
else as your possession, surrendering all else to God and Fortune.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.4.39
“Who then is invincible? The one who cannot be upset by anything
outside their reasoned choice.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.18.21
“The soul is a sphere, true to itself. It neither projects itself toward
any external thing nor does it collapse on itself, but instead radi­
ates a light which it shows itself the truth of all things and the
truth in itself.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.12

THE WAKE UP

E

ach day you write in this journal, you’ll be following in the footsteps
of Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and all the other great Stoics. The
Stoics did not face each day on a whim, but instead with preparation
and discipline. They spent real time thinking and anticipating what
was to come over the course of a day, a week, a year. Each morning
activity—journaling included—was designed to make them ready to
face the day. And with your work in this book, so you will be, too.
“Ask yourself the following first thing in the morning:
• What am I lacking in attaining freedom from passion?
• What for tranquility?
• What am I? A mere body, estate-holder, or reputation? None
of these things.
• What, then? A rational being.
• What then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions.
• How did I steer away from serenity?
• What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring?
• What did I fail to do in all these things?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.6.34-35
“On those mornings you struggle with getting up, keep this thought
in mind—I am awakening to the work of a human being. Why
then am I annoyed that I am going to do what I’m made for, the
very things for which I was put into this world? Or was I made
for this, to snuggle under the covers and keep warm? It’s so plea­
surable. Were you then made for pleasure? In short, to be coddled
or to exert yourself?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.1

A LITTLE BETTER EVERY DAY

T

he Stoics saw their lives as works in progress. They didn’t believe
they were born perfect but they believed that with work, and ded­
ication, they could get a little better every day. There is real delight in
this progress, as Epictetus quoted by way of Socrates. Marcus Aurelius
avidly pursued his own education and improvement, eagerly looking
for advice from books, mentors, and historical examples. Follow that
example this week, and see how you get a little better as each day
passes.
We must keep constant watch over ourselves and, as Seneca phrased
it, put each day up for review. Looking back on our day helps us to
better understand where we may have fallen short and gives us tangible
feedback for how to improve and grow. Only what you measure and
record can be monitored; only what you put up for reflection can be
learned from.
“I will keep constant watch over myself and—most usefully—will
put each day up for review. For this is what makes us evil—that
none of us looks back upon our own lives. We reflect upon only
that which we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future
descend from the past.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 83.2
“From Rusticus ... I learned to read carefully and not be satisfied
with a rough understanding of the whole, and not to agree too
quickly with those who have a lot to say about something.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 1.7.3
“But what does Socrates say? ‘Just as one person delights in improv­
ing his farm, and another his horse, so I delight in attending to
my own improvement day by day.*”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.5.14

FOCUS ON THE PRESENT MOMENT

arcus Aurelius ruled at a particularly turbulent time. Wars erupted
1 I on multiple fronts. Terrible plagues ravaged Rome. His rule was
certainly one of constant, unrelenting pressure. But he never let it over­
whelm him. From the Stoics and from the example of his adoptive father,
the Emperor Antoninus Pius, Marcus found a coping strategy in always
sticking close to the present moment and the duties at hand. When our
own stress boils over, we can remember his practices and exercises, to
stick with what is in front of us and not everything it might mean.
“At every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a
Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity,
affection, freedom, and justice—giving yourself a break from all
other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task
as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subver­
sion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your
fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it
possible to live an abundant and devout life.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5
“Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multi­
ple of that, keep in mind that no one ever loses a life other than
the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the
one they are losing. The longest and the shortest life, then, amount
to the same, for the present moment lasts the same for all and is
all anyone possesses. No one can lose either the past or the future,
for how can someone be deprived of what’s not theirs?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.14
“Don’t let your reflection on the whole sweep of life crush you.
Don’t fill your mind with all the bad things that might still hap­
pen. Stay focused on the present situation and ask yourself why
it’s so unbearable and can’t be survived.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, S.36

SUSPEND YOUR OPINIONS

£ pictetus would teach that opinions were “the cause of a troubled
Lm mind.” Opinions about the way we think things should be, need to
be. One of the Stoic words for “opinion” is “dogma.” The practice of
Stoicism begins with a relentless attempt to suspend this dogmatic way
of living—a cessation of the belief that you can force your opinions and
expectations onto the world.
“We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not
let it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power
to shape our judgments.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.52
“Today I escaped from the crush of circumstances, or better put, I
threw them out, for the crush wasn’t from outside me but in my
own assumptions.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.13
“There are two things that must be rooted out in human beings—
arrogant opinion and mistrust. Arrogant opinion expects that
there is nothing further needed, and mistrust assumes that under
the torrent of circumstance there can be no happiness.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.14.8
“Throw out your conceited opinions, for it is impossible for a per­
son to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows.”

WATCH OVER YOUR PERCEPTIONS

r very moment brings a flood of impressions of the world around us,
L- and our minds are filled with the perceptions that arise with them.
The Stoics teach us that we must keep a constant watch on this flood,
as if we are standing guard to protect something of vital importance.
What is it that we are protecting? Our peace of mind, clarity, and
freedom—all of which are anchored in our perceptions. Epictetus reminds
us that we need to pay attention to what matters and to learn how to
ignore so many of the relentless provocations that come our way.
“Keep constant guard over your perceptions, for it is no small thing
you are protecting, but your respect, trustworthiness and steadi­
ness, peace of mind, freedom from pain and fear, in a word your
freedom. For what would you sell these things?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.6b-8

“An important place to begin in philosophy is this: a clear percep­
tion of one’s own ruling principle.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.26.15

“I don’t agree with those who plunge headlong into the middle of
the flood and who, accepting a turbulent life, struggle daily in
great spirit with difficult circumstances. The wise person will
endure that, but won’t choose it—choosing to be at peace, rather
than at war.”

REDUCE WANTS, INCREASE HAPPINESS

THhe Stoics knew that wanting less increases gratitude, just as wantI ing more obliterates it. Epictetus focused much of his teaching on
helping his students reduce the destructive habit of wanting more. In it
he saw the key to a happy life and relationships. By practicing the art
of wanting less and being grateful for the portion that we already have
before us, we are hopping off the so-called hedonic treadmill and tak­
ing a real step on the path to a life of real contentment.
“Remember to conduct yourself in life as if at a banquet. As some­
thing being passed around comes to you, reach out your hand and
take a moderate helping. Does it pass you by? Don’t stop it. It hasn’t
yet come? Don’t burn in desire for it, but wait until it arrives in
front of you. Act this way with children, a spouse, toward posi­
tion, with wealth—one day it will make you worthy of a banquet
with the gods.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 15

“When children stick their hand down a narrow goody jar they
can’t get their full fist out and start crying. Drop a few treats and
you will get it out! Curb your desire—don’t set your heart on so
many things and you will get what you need.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.9.22

“Freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart’s desire but by
removing your desire.”

CULTIVATE INDIFFERENCE

Q ome people spend their lives chasing good things: health, wealth,
O pleasure, achievement. Others try to avoid the bad things with equal
energy: sickness, poverty, pain. These look like two drastically differ­
ent approaches but in the end, they are the same. The Stoics continually
reminded themselves that so many of the things we desire and avoid
are beyond our control. Instead of chasing impossibilities, the Stoics
trained to be equally prepared and equally suited to thrive in either
condition. They trained to be indifferent. This is a great power and the
cultivation of this skill is a very powerful exercise.
“Of all the things that are, some are good, others bad, and yet oth­
ers indifferent. The good are virtues and all that share in them;
the bad are the vices and all that indulge them; the indifferent lie
in between virtue and vice and include wealth, health, life, death,
pleasure, and pain.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.19.1 2b-13
“My reasoned choice is as indifferent to the reasoned choice of my
neighbor, as to his breath and body. However much we’ve been
made for cooperation, the ruling reason in each of us is master of
its own affairs. If this weren’t the case, the evil in someone else
could become my harm, and God didn’t mean for someone else
to control my misfortune.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.56
“There are things in life which are advantageous and disadvanta­
geous—both beyond our control.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 92.16

WHAT EXPENSIVE THINGS COST

PJ rom the Cynics, the Stoics learned the powerful practice of focusing
I on the true worth (axia) of things. That the cost of an item isn’t
simply what it’s sold for, but what it costs the owner to own. So much
of our desire for material goods comes at the great price of both anxi­
ety and the loss of our serenity—and even when gained, these things
often leave us more anxious and less serene. This week, spend some
time reflecting on what the things you buy actually cost. See if they are
really worth what you have been paying.
“So, concerning the things we pursue, and for which we vigorously
exert ourselves, we owe this consideration—either there is noth­
ing useful in them, or most aren’t useful. Some of them are super­
fluous, while others aren’t worth that much. But we don’t discern
this and see them as free, when they cost us dearly.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 42.6

“If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be furi­
ous. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along,
so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled—have
you no shame in that?”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 28

“Diogenes of Sinope said we sell things of great value for things of
very little, and vice versa.”
—Diogenes Laertius,

WEEK XI
THINK ABOUT IT FROM THE OTHER
PERSON’S PERSPECTIVE

w

e tend to assume the best about our own intentions and the worst
about other people’s. Then we wonder why life is so full of con­
flict! The Stoics flipped this habit around, reminding themselves to be
suspicious about their own first reaction and to approach others first
with sympathy. Powerful people are often surprisingly terrible at
behaving this way, but Marcus Aurelius, the most powerful man on
earth during his reign, was renowned for his humanity in dealing with
others. He told himself to always take a moment to remember his own
failings and to contemplate how another might see a situation. He
reminded himself, as we should, that most people are trying their best,
even though that’s easy to lose sight of in the rough and tumble of daily
life. Let’s remember that this week and think about each interaction
from more than just our own point of view.
“Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately con­
sider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when
you see that, you’ll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or
rage. For you may yourself have the same notions of good and
evil, or similar ones, in which case you’ll make an allowance for
what they’ve done. But if you no longer hold the same notions,
you’ll be more readily gracious for their error.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.26
“When your sparring partner scratches or head-butts you, you
don’t then make a show of it, or protest, or view him with suspi­
cion or as plotting against you. And yet you keep an eye on him,
not as an enemy or with suspicion, but with a healthy avoidance.
You should act this way with all things in life. We should give a
pass to many things with our fellow trainees. For, as I’ve said, it’s
possible to avoid without suspicion or hate.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.20

THE PORTABLE RETREAT

i

t is in the future—on a vacation, on our day off, when we plan to get
out into nature—that we think we’ll find peace and release from the
crush of the everyday demands of life. Yet this never seems to really
happen as often as we think, does it? And when we do get that peace,
it is difficult to keep once we’re back in the fray. For a Stoic, all of this
is madness. The true retreat is to the freedom of our own mind and
soul, to consider the gifts we already have that can be our refuge for ail
time. If we take the time, daily, to do so.
“People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or
in the mountains. You are very much in the habit of yearning for
those same things. But this is entirely the trait of a base person,
when you can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself. For
nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than
in your own soul—especially if on close inspection it is filled with
ease, which I say is nothing more than being well-ordered. Treat
yourself often to this retreat and be renewed.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.3.1
“Remember that it’s not only the desire for wealth and position
that debases and subjugates us, but also the desire for peace, leisure,
travel, and learning. It doesn’t matter what the external thing is,
the value we place on it subjugates us to another... where our heart
is set, there our impediment lies.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.4.1-2; 15
“Remember that your ruling reason becomes unconquerable when
it rallies and relies on itself, so that it won’t do anything contrary
to its own will, even if its position is irrational. How much more
unconquerable if its judgments are careful and made rationally?
Therefore, the mind freed from passions is an impenetrable
fortress—a person has no more secure place of refuge for all time.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.48

SAY NO TO THE NEED TO IMPRESS

i

f the desire to impress and be liked by others is innate to humans as
a species, then every generation born before social media got off
lucky. Today we face an unending stream of status updates demanding
to be filled with all the impressive things we are doing, the trials we are
overcoming, announcements of our dangers averted and triumphs real­
ized. It’s exhausting. Centuries ago, Epictetus saw this pride and nar­
cissism even in his (computerless) students and reminded them it wasn’t
so innocent. In fact, he told them that it would destroy their life’s pur­
pose, it would distract and fatigue them. Seneca, too, saw this seeking
of the approval of spectators as one of life’s disgraces. Watch those
impulses this week, notice how much you seem to need your phone and
status updates and then ask: Is this the kind of person I want to be? Is
this what a philosopher would do?
“If you should ever turn your will to things outside your control in
order to impress someone, be sure that you have wrecked your
whole purpose in life. Be content, then, to be a philosopher in all
that you do, and if you wish also to be seen as one, show yourself
first that you are and you will succeed.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 23
“In public avoid talking often and excessively about your accom­
plishments and dangers, for however much you enjoy recounting
your dangers, it’s not so pleasant for others to hear about your
affairs.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 33.14
“How disgraceful is the lawyer whose dying breath passes while at
court, at an advanced age, pleading for unknown litigants and
still seeking the approval of ignorant spectators.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 20.2

WHAT CAN GO WRONG . . . MIGHT

w

e call the people who dwell on what might go wrong “pessimists.”
Some even think that bad thoughts attract bad events. The Sto­
ics found this all to be nonsense. In fact, they had a practice oipraemeditatio malorwn (premeditation of evils) that specifically encouraged
musing on the so-called worst-case scenario. Marcus would begin his
day thinking about all the ugliness he would see on display at court—
not for the purpose of working himself up, but precisely the opposite,
to calm and focus himself to be prepared to act in the proper way rather
than to react. Seneca, too, practiced meditating in advance, not only
about what normally happens, but what could happen. Epictetus went
as far as to imagine losing a loved one every time he would kiss them.
The Stoics believed all that we have is on loan from Fortune, and that
negative visualization helps increase our awareness of the unexpected—
don’t shy away from this in your thoughts.
“When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter
busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks.
They are all stricken with these afflictions because they don’t
know the difference between good and evil. Because I have under­
stood the beauty of good and the ugliness of evil, I know that
these wrongdoers are still akin to me ... and that none can do me
harm, or implicate me in ugliness—nor can I be angry at my
relatives or hate them. For we are made for cooperation.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1
“Being unexpected adds to the weight of a disaster, and being a
surprise has never failed to increase a person’s pain. For that rea­
son, nothing should ever be unexpected by us. Our minds should
be sent out in advance to all things and we shouldn’t just consider
the normal course of things, but what could actually happen. For
is there anything in life that Fortune won’t knock off its high
horse if it pleases her?”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 91.3a-4

TEST YOUR IMPRESSIONS

^^\ne of Epictetus’s key teachings was about testing all our
impressions—any experience, perception, or circumstance that
we find in front of us. He uses a key verb to emphasize this practice,
dokimdzd, ten times in the Discourses and once in the opening of the
Enchiridion. The word carries the meaning of the assayer, one who
tests fine metals and coins to verify their authenticity. In one of the
most memorable uses Epictetus compares our need to test impressions
to what is done with coins and how the skilled merchant can hear a
counterfeit coin cast upon a table just as a musician would detect a sour
note. This week, let us go through the exercise of assaying everything
that comes before us, assuming it all to be counterfeit or misleading
until we can prove otherwise.
“When it comes to money, where we feel our clear interest, we have
an entire art where the tester uses many means to discover the
worth . . . just as we give great attention to judging things that
might steer us badly. But when it comes to our own ruling princi­
ple, we yawn and doze off, accepting any appearance that flashes
by without counting the cost.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.20.8; 11

“First off, don’t let the force of the impression carry you away. Say
to it, ‘hold up a bit and let me see who you are and where you are
from—let me put you to the test.’..
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.24

“From the very beginning, make it your practice to say to every
harsh impression, ‘you are an impression and not at all what you
appear to be.’ Next, examine and test it by the rules you possess,
the first and greatest of which is this—whether it belongs to the
things in our control or not in our control, and if the latter, be
prepared to respond, ‘It is nothing to me.*”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 1.5

IMPULSE CONTROL

i

f something is making you upset, write it here and look at it. What
happened? Who caused it? Now think about your reaction: What did
you say? What did you feel? Did this make it better or worse? Marcus
Aurelius, as emperor, clearly had many people and causes to be upset
about. He also had real power and authority. Even so we find that he
would tell himself, “You have power over your mind—not outside
events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” So, too, with what has
happened to you—you did not control what happened, but you do
control which impulses you follow in the wake of it.
“Epictetus says we must discover the missing art of assent and pay
special attention to the sphere of our impulses—that they are
subject to reservation, to the common good, and that they are in
proportion to actual worth.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.37

“You say, good fortune used to meet you at every corner. But the
fortunate person is the one who gives themselves a good fortune.
And good fortunes are a well-tuned soul, good impulses, and
good actions.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.36

“Frame your thoughts like this—you are an old person, you won’t
let yourself be enslaved by this any longer, no longer pulled like a
puppet by every impulse, and you’ll stop complaining about your
present fortune or dreading the future.”

THE FREEDOM OF CONTEMPT

^T"he language we use to describe things imputes value to those things.
I We often embellish our language with superlatives to help make
our choices of what to buy, wear, eat, or drink seem much better than
they really are. As emperor, Marcus Aurelius could have the finest
Falernian wine at his table at any meal—but he preferred to remind
himself it was only grape juice. As emperor, he was the only Roman
allowed to wear a purple cloak, but he took pains to point out that his
cloak was like any other, just dyed with shellfish blood to produce the
purple hue. This week, practice cutting your own luxuries and the
things you yearn for down to size with a little contempt. Describe them
with the bluntest language you can—and see how much their power
over you diminishes.
“Just as when meat or other foods are set before us we think, this
is a dead fish, a dead bird or pig; and also, this fine wine is only
the juice of a bunch of grapes, this purple-edged robe just sheep’s
wool dyed in a bit of blood from a shellfish; or of sex, that it
is only rubbing private parts together followed by a spasmic
discharge—in the same way our impressions grab actual events
and permeate them, so we see them as they really are.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.13
“Keep a list before your mind of those who burned with anger and
resentment about something, of even the most renowned for suc­
cess, misfortune, evil deeds, or any special distinction. Then ask
yourself, how did that work out? Smoke and dust, the stuff of
simple myth trying to be legend ...”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.27
“You know what wine and liqueur tastes like. It makes no differ­
ence whether a hundred or a thousand bottles pass through your
bladder—you are nothing more than a filter.”

SHOW, DON’T TELL

T"he art of living isn’t a set of teachings or a formula we can memoI rize. It’s a practice that requires constant work. Epictetus was con­
stantly reminding his students not to parrot back what they’d heard in
the lecture hall or read in books, but to put it to work in practice. He
knew that progress you could see was better than any proclaimed. Let
your writing this week exhibit what you have done and what you are
doing, not on what you plan to do or think you are. Let it be a cata­
log of your actions—good actions.
“Those who receive the bare theories immediately want to spew
them, as an upset stomach does its food. First digest your theories
and you won’t throw them up. Otherwise they will be raw,
spoiled, and not nourishing. After you’ve digested them, show us
the changes in your reasoned choices, just like the shoulders of
gymnasts display their diet and training, and as the craft of arti­
sans show in what they’ve learned.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.21.1-3
“First practice not letting people know who you are—keep your
philosophy to yourself for a bit. In just the manner that fruit is
produced—the seed buried for a season, hidden, growing gradu­
ally so it may come to full maturity. But if the grain sprouts before
the stalk is fully developed, it will never ripen---- That is the kind
of plant you are, displaying fruit too soon, and the winter will
kill you.”

WE ARE A PRODUCT OF OUR HABITS

"T^he Roman Stoics put a heavy emphasis on dealing with habitual
I behavior in order to make progress in the art of living. The great
Roman Stoic educator Musonius Rufus held that all the theory in the
world couldn’t trump good habits (or overcome bad habits). Epictetus
followed Musonius in this focus on habit, with an eye to not reinforc­
ing bad habits—such as anger—and finding a way to replace them with
better ones. We all recognize bad habits when we see them in others,
but it’s a little harder to see them in ourselves. This week meditate on
the habits or recurring behaviors that are holding you back—even ask
someone close to you to help.
“Every habit and capability is confirmed and grows in its corre­
sponding actions, walking by walking, and running by running...
therefore, if you want to do something, make a habit of it; if you
don’t want to do that, don’t, but make a habit of something else
instead. The same principle is at work in our state of mind. When
you get angry, you’ve not only experienced that evil, but you’ve
also reinforced a bad habit, adding fuel to the fire.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.1-5

“If you don’t wish to be a hothead, don’t feed your habit. Try as a
first step to remain calm and count the days you haven’t been
angry. I used to be angry every day, now every other day, then
every third or fourth ... if you make it as far as thirty days, thank
God! For habit is first weakened and then obliterated. When you
can say ‘I didn’t lose my temper today, or the next day, or for three
or four months, but kept my cool under provocation,’ you will
know you are in better health.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.11b-14

“What assistance can we find in the fight against habit? Try the
opposite!”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.27.4

COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS

i

t’s easy to complain about the things missing in our lives, and so much
harder to appreciate how much we already have. Seneca reminded us
that everything we need to be happy is right in front of us, while the
luxuries we might be missing would themselves come at great cost—at
the cost of what we already have. Marcus agreed, and reminded him­
self to count those blessings present in our lives and to imagine what it
would be like to not have them (and how much we would miss them).
List your blessings this week, take conscious note of what you are for­
tunate to have and enjoy, so you can see clearly, as Epictetus put it,
where they came from and feel a sense of gratitude for that.
“Don’t set your mind on things you don’t possess as if they were
yours, but count the blessings you actually possess and think how
much you would desire them if they weren’t already yours. But
watch yourself, that you don’t value these things to the point of
being troubled if you should lose them.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.27
“The founder of the universe, who assigned to us the laws of life,
provided that we should live well, but not in luxury. Everything
needed for our well-being is right before us, whereas what luxury
requires is gathered by many miseries and anxieties. Let us use
this gift of nature and count it among the greatest things.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 119.15b
“It is easy to praise providence for anything that may happen if you
have two qualities: a complete view of what has actually hap­
pened in each instance and a sense of gratitude. Without gratitude
what is the point of seeing, and without seeing what is the object
of gratitude?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.6.1-2

PRACTICE TRUE JOY

"T"he Stoics held joy (chara) to be one of the good passions, worthy of
I practice in everyday life. But Stoic joy isn’t about the delights of
the senses or material pleasure. To Marcus, joy was being kind to oth­
ers. To Seneca, it was freedom from fear of suffering and death. Let’s
laugh with Democritus, as Seneca says, and engage in our “proper
human work” with joy. Consider in your writing this week where you
might find joy and what good you might do with it.
“Joy for human beings lies in proper human work. And proper
human work consists in: acts of kindness to other human beings,
disdain for the stirrings of the senses, identifying trustworthy
impressions, and contemplating the natural order and all that
happens in keeping with it.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.26

“Trust me, real joy is a serious thing. Do you think someone can,
in the charming expression, blithely dismiss death with an easy
disposition? Or swing open the door to poverty, keep pleasures
in check, or meditate on the endurance of suffering? The one who
is comfortable with turning these thoughts over is truly full of joy,
but hardly cheerful. It’s exactly such a joy that I would wish for
you to possess, for it will never run dry once you’ve laid claim to
its source.”
—Seneca, Moral LETTERSy 23.4

“Heraclitus would shed tears whenever he went out in public—
Democritus laughed. One saw the whole as a parade of miseries,
the other of follies. And so, we should take a lighter view of things
and bear them with an easy spirit, for it is more human to laugh
at life than to lament it.”
—Seneca, On Tranquility OFMiNDy 15.2

THE VIEW FROM ABOVE

"T"he way to escape petty concerns and worries of daily existence
I requires taking some time out and getting what Stoics like to call
“the view from above.” This was something Marcus Aurelius reminded
himself to do regularly. He had learned from Heraclitus that everything
in the world was constantly changing and that remembering this can
eliminate so many stresses and concerns. This week don’t just look at
what you’re dealing with in your life up close; try to see it from far
away, too. Try to describe what another, larger perspective would look
like—of your problems, of your worries, of your obsessions.
“How beautifully Plato put it. Whenever you want to talk about
people, it’s best to take a bird’s-eye view and see everything all at
once—of gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births
and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign peo­
ple, holidays, memorials, markets—all blended together and
arranged in a pairing of opposites.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.48
“Watch the stars in their courses and imagine yourself running
alongside them. Think constantly on the changes of the elements
into each other, for such thoughts wash away the dust of earthly
life.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.47
“The cosmic order—the same for everyone—wasn’t made by any
god or human, but always was and always will be. An eternal fire,
kindled in measures, and extinguished in measures.”
—Heraclitus (as quoted by Clement of Alexandria)

ROLE MODELS

A doption was a widespread practice in Roman society, especially in
#\the senatorial class and as a provision for imperial succession.
Marcus Aurelius himself was the adopted son of Emperor Antoninus
Pius, who himself was adopted by the Emperor Hadrian so that Mar­
cus would one day succeed them both to the purple. While Seneca was
never adopted, his brother Novatus was, becoming Gallio who in the
New Testament refused to press charges on Saint Paul. But Seneca liked
to look at the phenomenon of adoption the other way around, saying
we can always choose whose children we want to be. For him, Cato,
the towering, resolute Stoic who railed against Julius Caesar in defense
of the Republic, was always standing by in his mind. The first book in
Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is a catalog of all the people he had
learned from and the lessons he had taken from their lives. Use this
week to think of models that you can follow, wise and admirable peo­
ple you can measure yourself against.
“We like to say that we don’t get to choose our parents, that they
were given by chance—yet we can truly choose whose children
we’d like to be.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 15.3a

“We can remove most sins if we have a witness standing by as we
are about to go wrong. The soul should have someone it can
respect, by whose example it can make its inner sanctum more
inviolable. Happy is the person who can improve others, not only
when present, but even when in their thoughts!”
—Seneca, Moral LETTERSy 11.9

TRY THE OTHER HANDLE

IJ^ pictetus offered a powerful tool in his handbook, the Enchiridion,
t. which Stoics use as an exercise in decision-making about difficult
events. Everything, Epictetus said, has two interpretations, or handles
by which they can be grabbed: one that will make it harder, one that
will make it easier. Do you take offense? Or do you focus on common
ground? Do you focus on all that has gone wrong? Or what has gone
right? Ask yourself these questions about everything you see and feel
this week. Make sure you are using the right handle.

i

“Every event has two handles—one by which it can be carried, and
one by which it can’t. If your brother does you wrong, don’t grab
it by his wronging, because this is the handle incapable of lifting
it. Instead, use the other—that he is your brother, that you were
raised together, and then you will have hold of the handle that
carries.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 43
“No, it is events that give rise to fear—when another has power over
them or can prevent them, that person becomes able to inspire
fear. How is the fortress destroyed? Not by iron or fire, but by
judgments . . . here is where we must begin, and it is from this
front that we must seize the fortress and throw out the tyrants.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.1.85-86; 87a

TAKE A WALK

Q eneca believed we should take frequent wandering walks, because
w constant work will fracture our minds. (As a writer he must have
agreed with the novelist Helen Dunmore, “A problem with a piece of
writing often clarifies itself if you go for a long walk.”) Take some good
walks this week and watch the dullness and feebleness depart. Enjoy
the scenery, enjoy being away from your work. Make them part of your
morning and evening writing routine. Return with a stimulated mind
that’s ready to journal about and follow the philosophy you know. You
think that it’s taking a “break,” but really you end up smarter and
clearer than you were when you left.
“We should take wandering outdoor walks, so that the mind might
be nourished and refreshed by the open air and deep breathing.”
—Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 17.8

“Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and
come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive
might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to
the tree that gave it growth.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2

“The mind must be given relaxation—it will rise improved and
sharper after a good break. Just as rich fields must not be forced—
for they will quickly lose their fertility if never given a break—so
constant work on the anvil will fracture the force of the mind. But
it regains its powers if it is set free and relaxed for a while. Con­
stant work gives rise to a certain kind of dullness and feebleness
in the rational soul.”

WHAT’S IN YOUR WAY IS THE WAY

bstacles are a fact of life. Even the most powerful and lucky of us
are not exempt from this reality, but we have a superpower at our
hands through Stoic philosophy in that our purposes, intentions, and
attitudes can adapt to any conditions to find a way forward. The Stoics
had a word for this, hupexhairesis, meaning acting with a kind of
“reserve-clause” or “reverse-clause” that allows us to reconsider and
set a new course of action as needed. Marcus Aurelius tells us that any
obstacle can actually become the raw material for a new purpose! How
might the obstacles you’re facing reveal a new path?
“While it’s true that someone can impede our actions, they can’t
impede our intentions and our attitudes, which have the power of
being conditional and adaptable. For the mind adapts and con­
verts any obstacle to its action into a means of achieving it. That
which is an impediment to action is turned to advance action. The
obstacle on the path becomes the way.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.20
“. . . just as nature turns to its own purpose any obstacle or any
opposition, sets its place in the destined order, and co-opts it, so
every rational person can convert any obstacle into the raw mate­
rial for their own purpose.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.35
“You must build up your life action by action, and be content if
each one achieves its goal as far as possible—and no one can keep
you from this. But there will be some external obstacle! Perhaps,
but no obstacle to acting with justice, self-control, and wisdom.
But what if some other area of my action is thwarted? Well, gladly
accept the obstacle for what it is and shift your attention to what
is given, and another action will immediately take its place, one
that better fits the life you are building.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.32

PROTECT YOUR OWN GOOD

M

usonius Rufus, one of Epictetus’s teachers, taught that human
beings are all born with an innate goodness, or, as he put it, with
an inclination to virtue. It’s our choices that decide whether that good­
ness comes out or not. We’re not bad people, essentially, though we
might sometimes do bad things. The purpose of Stoicism then is to
remind us of that goodness and to help us work hard to protect it.
Spend some time writing about the choices you can make this week—
the actions you can take—to do just that.
“Protect your own good in all that you do, and as concerns every­
thing else take what is given as far as you can make reasoned use
of it. If you don’t, you’ll be unlucky, prone to failure, hindered,
and stymied.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.11

DON’T LOOK FOR THE THIRD THING

T

he Stoics teach us that doing well is its own reward. To do the
right thing, and to see someone helped by it, is enough. To go
around expecting thanks—what Marcus Aurelius described as the
“third thing”—on top of it? That’s being greedy. Keeping score not
only misses the purpose of being good, it’s foolish. It sets you up for
disappointment. If you are going to do some accounting, look at it from
the other direction. How many people have helped us—and what do
we owe them in return? Think about clearing your debts this week, and
consider forgiving any notion of others owing you.
“One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the
expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still consid­
ers the person a debtor and knows the favor. A third kind of
person acts as if not conscious of the deed, rather like a vine
producing a cluster of grapes without making further demands,
like a horse after its race, or a dog after its walk, or a bee after
making its honey. Such a person, having done a good deed, won’t
go shouting from rooftops but simply moves on to the next deed
just like the vine produces another bunch of grapes in the right
season.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.6

“When you’ve done well and another has benefited by it, why like
a fool do you look for a third thing on top—credit for the good
deed or a favor in return?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.73

PRACTICE GENTLENESS INSTEAD OF ANGER

I t’s easy to imagine Marcus Aurelius losing his temper. His responsiI bilities were vast and his job required him to work with many frus­
trating, difficult people. As such, he had an acute sense of the problem
of anger, knowing just how counterproductive it can be and how mis­
erable it can make its users. He often repeated a simple exercise designed
to preserve goodwill for others by simply replacing anger with gentle­
ness. We can’t allow ourselves to desert our goodwill, and we must
remind ourselves that no one makes a mistake willingly. Each time you
feel anger this week, remember Marcus and see how you might replace
it with gentleness—and write these examples down.
“As you move forward along the path of reason, people will stand
in your way. They will never be able to keep you from doing what’s
sound, so don’t let them knock out your goodwill for them. Keep
a steady watch on both fronts, not only for well-based judgments
and actions, but also for gentleness with those who would obstruct
our path or create other difficulties. For getting angry is also a
weakness, just as much as abandoning the task or surrendering
under panic.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.9

“As Plato said, every soul is deprived of truth against its will. The
same holds true for justice, self-control, goodwill to others, and
every similar virtue. It’s essential to constantly keep this in your
mind, for it will make you more gentle to all.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.63

“Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on—
it isn’t manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are
more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn’t give way
to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage,
and endurance....”

KEEPING “THE NEWS” IN CHECK

PJJ ven the ancients felt inundated with gossip and news. This week you
L-will face a barrage like they couldn’t have imagined—from texts,
calls, e-mails to the incessant grind of the 24/7 news machine. Instead
of responding to every status update, urgent call, or the latest trending
incendiary news story, take a moment to remember three ways the
Stoics used to keep their focus on their purpose and duty in the present
moment: (1) Step away from the noise. (2) Remember that no news can
throw you off the purpose of your present choices. (3) Don’t add some­
thing negative (or positive) to what is being reported.
“Are you distracted by breaking news? Then take some leisure time
to learn something good, and stop bouncing around. But when
you do, keep in mind the other mistake, to be so distracted by
getting control that you wear yourself out and lose a purpose by
which you can direct your impulses and thoughts.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.7
“Whenever disturbing news is delivered to you, bear in mind that
no news can ever be relevant to your reasoned choice. Can any­
one break news to you that your assumptions or desires are
wrong? No way! But they can tell you someone died—even so,
what is that to you?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.18.1-2
“Don’t tell yourself anything more than what the initial impres­
sions report. It’s been reported to you that someone is speaking
badly about you. This is the report—the report wasn’t that you’ve
been harmed. I see that my son is sick—but not that his life is at
risk. So always stay within your first impressions, and don’t add
to them in your head—this way nothing can happen to you.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.49

A WEEK WITHOUT COMPLAINING

□ pictetus spoke often to his students about the need to give up blamE— ing and complaining—in fact, he saw it as one of the primary mea­
suring sticks of progress in the art of living. How much of life is wasted
pointing fingers? Has complaining ever solved a single problem? Mar­
cus Aurelius would say, “Blame yourself—or no one.” This week, try
constructive feedback over complaining and responsibility over blame.
And if something goes wrong, spend some time reflecting on what the
true causes were. Don’t waste a minute with complaints—in this jour­
nal or out loud.
“You must stop blaming God, and not blame any person. You must
completely control your desire and shift your avoidance to what
lies within your reasoned choice. You must no longer feel anger,
resentment, envy, or regret.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.22.13

“For nothing outside my reasoned choice can hinder or harm it—
my reasoned choice alone can do this to itself. If we would lean
this way whenever we fail, and would blame only ourselves and
remember that nothing but opinion is the cause of a troubled
mind and uneasiness, then by God, I swear we would be making
progress.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.19.2-3

“But if you deem as your own only what is yours, and what belongs
to others as truly not yours, then no one will ever be able to coerce
or to stop you, you will find no one to blame or accuse, you will
do nothing against your will, you will have no enemy, no one will
harm you, because no harm can affect you.”

WHAT LITTLE WINS CAN YOU FIND?

"yTeno of Citium, the Phoenician merchant who founded the Stoic
^-school on the painted porch (stoa poikile) of the Agora after a
shipwreck, said that happiness was a matter of small steps. While the
Stoics believed in the perfectibility of human beings, they knew much
stood in the way of realizing that potential. So they would be skeptical
of the so-called epic wins and quantum leaps that our culture obsesses
over today. Instead, they would urge you to focus on your daily duties,
on making incremental progress. Spend your writing time this week
thinking about the small wins you can rack up, what little gains can be
had from this improvement or that one, a decision here or a decision
there. Be satisfied with each small step. Keep moving and don’t give up.
“Do now what nature demands of you. Get right to it if that’s in
your power. Don’t look around to see if people will know about
it. Don’t await the perfection of Plato’s Republic, but be satisfied
with even the smallest step forward and regard the outcome as a
small thing.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.29
“We don’t abandon our pursuits because we despair of ever per­
fecting them.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.2.37b
“Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing.”
—Zeno, Quoted in Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.26

ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION

uch of what we do and say during the course of a week is completely
i I unnecessary. Meetings, material possessions, confrontations,
pursuits—pointless distractions and problems. They take us away
from tranquility and purpose. A Stoic cuts through these temptations
and obligations by asking this question, a question that you should lead
your journaling with this week. Try it. Before speaking, acting, or
buying something, ask simply: “Is this one of the necessary things?”
“It is said that if you would have peace of mind, busy yourself with
little. But wouldn’t a better saying be do what you must and as
required of a rational being created for public life? For this brings
not only the peace of mind of doing few things, but the greater
peace of doing them well. Since the vast majority of our words
and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abun­
dance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn’t forget
at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things? But
we must corral not only unnecessary actions but unnecessary
thoughts, too, so needless acts don’t tag along after them.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.24

“I was shipwrecked before I even boarded ... the journey showed
me this—how much of what we have is unnecessary, and how
easily we can decide to rid ourselves of these things whenever it’s
necessary, never suffering the loss.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 87.1

WEEK XXXIV
JUST SAY NO TO FUTURE MISERY

.
;

II ow often we make ourselves miserable ... in advance. Out of fear
I I of this, out of desperate hope for that. When we focus on pining
for or avoiding a certain future, we make ourselves miserable here in
the present. Hecato of Rhodes, the great student of the great middleStoic scholar Panaetius, taught that this misery is always tied to hopes
or fears we give to imagined future outcomes. From this Seneca reminds
us this week to say no to both, because indulging them robs us of the
ability to enjoy the present. As you write, don’t think about the future—
what you hope will happen, what you fear might—just focus on right
now. What you’re doing and thinking right now.

i

'
!

“It’s ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and mis­
erable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things
it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul
will never be at rest—by longing for things to come it will lose the
ability to enjoy present things.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 98.5b-6a

“But there is no reason to live and no limit to our miseries if we let
our fears predominate.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 13.12b

“Hecato says, ‘Cease to hope and you will cease to fear.’. . . The
primary cause of both these ills is that instead of adapting our­
selves to present circumstances we send out thoughts too far
ahead.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 5.7b-8

A CURE FOR PROCRASTINATION

"T"o the Stoic, procrastination almost looks like a form of delusion
I and entitlement. Who is to say you’ll even be around next month
or next week to deal with it? If it’s important, they’d say, don’t wait.
Do it now. As Marcus says, if it needs to be done, do it with “courage
and promptness.” Procrastination seems like it makes things easier, but
it damns us to a low-grade, gnawing state of anxiety. Is that how you’d
want to spend this week? Any week? Your last week? Ask yourself:
What am I avoiding? What can I handle today instead of tomorrow?
What can I do promptly and bravely, right now?
“Anything that must yet be done, virtue can do with courage and
promptness. For anyone would call it a sign of foolishness for one
to undertake a task with a lazy and begrudging spirit, or to push
the body in one direction and the mind in another, to be torn
apart by wildly divergent impulses.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.B-32
“This is the mark of perfection of character—to spend each day as
if it were your last, without frenzy, laziness, or any pretending.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.69
“You get what you deserve. Instead of being a good person today,
you choose instead to become one tomorrow.”

A HARD WINTER TRAINING

^The art of living has three levels of discipline: study, practice, and
I hard training. Reading the Stoics, that’s study. Trying out the
lessons and reflecting on them in this journal, that’s practice. What’s
left is the hard training. Epictetus liked to use the analogy of the Roman
army’s practice of training hard in the off months of winter so they
would be prepared to meet any challenge when they returned to battle
in the spring. Seneca would spend time each month exposing himself
to tougher than usual conditions. He, too, used a military analogy,
pointing to the way soldiers are tasked with hard jobs so they would
be strong when the enemy eventually came. What are you doing this
week to push yourself beyond mere study and practice?
“We must undergo a hard winter training and not rush into things
for which we haven’t prepared.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.2.32
“Here’s a lesson to test your mind’s mettle: take part of a week in
which you have only the most meager and cheap food, dress
scantly in shabby clothes, and ask yourself if this is really the
worst that you feared. It is when times are good that you should
gird yourself for tougher times ahead, for when Fortune is kind
the soul can build defenses against her ravages. So it is that sol­
diers practice maneuvers in peacetime, erecting bunkers with no
enemies in sight and exhausting themselves under no attack so
that when it comes they won’t grow tired.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 18.5-6
“When a challenge confronts you, remember that God is matching
you with a younger sparring partner, as would a physical trainer.
Why? Becoming an Olympian takes sweat! I think no one has a
better challenge than yours, if only you would use it like an ath­
lete would that younger sparring partner.”

A NEW WAY TO PRAY

\ A Ae often pray for the things we desire and, in the process, excuse
V V ourselves from the equation. We’re hoping the heavens will mag­
ically gift us with the outcome we want—whether it’s for a promotion
or the speedy recovery of a loved one. The Stoics would urge you to
stop doing this. Marcus Aurelius reminded himself not to present the
gods with a list of demands for pleasures or comforts, but instead to
ask for help not needing those things. In a sense then, he was really
asking for inner strength. He was asking himself. Think about all the
things you want—that you’re praying or hoping for this week—and try
turning them around like that. See what you come up with instead.
“Try praying differently, and see what happens: Instead of asking
for ‘a way to sleep with her,’ try asking for ‘a way to stop desiring
to sleep with her.’ Instead of ‘a way to get rid of him,’ try asking for
‘a way to not crave his demise.’ Instead of ‘a way to not lose my
child,’ try asking for ‘a way to lose my fear of it.’”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.40.(6)

“We cry to God Almighty, how can we escape this agony? Fool,
don’t you have hands? Or could it be God forgot to give you a
pair? Sit and pray your nose doesn’t run! Or rather just wipe your
nose and stop seeking a scapegoat.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.16.13

“But I haven’t at any time been hindered in my will, nor forced
against it. And how is this possible? I have bound up my choice
to act with the will of God. God wills that I be sick, such is my
will. He wills that I should choose something, so do I. He wills
that I reach for something, or something be given to me—I wish
for the same. What God doesn’t will, I do not wish for.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.1.89

WEEK XXXVIII
ON HANDLING HATERS

■T"he Stoics taught that kindness trumps hate. They believed that
I those who engage in hate are prisoners to a destructive passion—
one that hurts the practitioner, not the intended target. There’s no
reason to hate a hater; they are already suffering enough. In fact, when
you see them this way, it makes it easier to be kind, good-natured,
genuine, and useful. Remember the line in the Bible about how loving
your enemies is like pouring hot coals on them, because it’s so unex­
pected? Who can you surprise like that this week? Whose enmity can
you meet with kindness and compassion? How much better do you feel
having done so?
“What if someone despises me? Let them see to it. But I will see to
it that I won’t be found doing or saying anything contemptible.
What if someone hates me? Let them see to that. But I will see to
it that I’m kind and good-natured to all, and prepared to show
even the hater where they went wrong. Not in a critical way, or
to show off my patience, but genuinely and usefully.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.13
“Kindness is invincible, but only when it’s sincere, with no hypoc­
risy or faking. For what can even the most malicious person do if
you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently
point out where they went wrong—right as they are trying to
harm you?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5.9a
“Keep in mind that it isn’t the one who has it in for you and takes
a swipe that harms you, but rather the harm comes from your
own belief about the abuse. So when someone arouses your anger,
know that it’s really your own opinion fueling it. Instead, make
it your first response not to be carried away by such impressions,
for with time and distance self-mastery is more easily achieved.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 20

PANIC IS SELF-INFLICTED HARM
I

K I ame one situation that is improved by panicking. Go ahead—
I X write it down if you’ve got one! Seneca mused often about the
problem of panic both in his letters and essays. It creates danger and
limits our ability to function effectively. It prevents us from finding
success and seeing objectively. Worse, it makes us weaker over time
because we’ve never truly faced the danger we are so worried about.
Meditate on the scary things that might make you panic. Think about
what is so overwhelming about them. Come to understand them. Get
familiar with them.
“For even peace itself will supply more reason for worry. Not even
safe circumstances will bring you confidence once your mind has
been shocked—once it gets in the habit of blind panic, it can’t
provide for its own safety. For it doesn’t really avoid danger, it just
runs away. Yet we are exposed to greater danger with our backs
turned.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 104.10b
“Success comes to the lowly and to the poorly talented, but the
special characteristic of a great person is to triumph over the
disasters and panics of human life.”
—Seneca, On Providence, 4.1
“The unprepared are panic-stricken by the smallest things.”

PRACTICE SILENCE

Q ocial media teaches us to have an opinion about everything. Silence
w beckons us to speak. We live in a loud culture and we try to keep up
by being louder in return. How much trouble does that cause us? How
much might we learn if we spent more time listening to others than we
do trying to sandwich our opinions in at every turn? How much of
what we say have we come to regret? The truly loud thing to say is
nothing. Write your thoughts down here this week, but see how many
of them you can keep to yourself. Be bold in your silence, in how much
you hold your tongue this week.
“Better to trip with the feet than with the tongue.”
—Zeno, Quoted in Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.26
“To the youngster talking nonsense Zeno said, ‘The reason why
we have two ears and only one mouth is so we might listen more
and talk less.’”
—Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.23
“Cato practiced the kind of public speech capable of moving the
masses, believing proper political philosophy takes care like any
great city to maintain the warlike element. But he was never seen
practicing in front of others, and no one ever heard him rehearse
a speech. When he was told that people blamed him for his silence,
he replied, ‘Better they not blame my life. I begin to speak only
when I’m certain what I’ll say isn’t better left unsaid.*”

PRACTICE LOVE

The Stoic notion of sympatheia, that we all are part of an organic
I whole, connected by mutual interests and affinities, is greater than
the Golden Rule. Don’t treat others how you would like to be treated,
treat them like you treat yourself, because we are all one. Seneca said
that whenever he encountered another human being he saw an opportu­
nity for kindness. He had learned from Hecato that if you want to be
loved there is only one thing to do: love others. Who can you give love
to this week? What kindness can you expend? How can you show how
you feel—strangers, friends, and family? How can you show them that
you believe we are all part of the same whole?
“Hecato says, T can teach you a love potion made without any
drugs, herbs, or special spell—if you would be loved, love.’”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 9.6
“A benefit should be kept like a buried treasure, only to be dug up
in necessity. . . . Nature bids us to do well by all. . . . Wherever
there is a human being, we have an opportunity for kindness.”
—Seneca, On the Happy Life, 24.2-3
“Nature produced us as a family, since we all sprang from the same
source and toward the same end. Nature bestowed upon us
mutual love, and joined us together as friends.”

MAKE HONESTY YOUR ONLY POLICY

A s emperor, Marcus Aurelius did not see the best of humanity. At
/ \court there would have been backbiting, people who sold their
friends out when they saw an opportunity to advance themselves, ava­
rice, and deceit. But he especially didn’t like faux attempts at honesty.
His point: if you have to say “I’m going to be honest with you here,”
you’re casually saying that honesty is the exception and not the rule.
How sad is that? It’s time to think about what those little statements
say about us—and make sure that our default policy is honesty and
straightforwardness.
“How rotten and fraudulent when people say they intend to give it
to you straight. What are you up to, dear friend? It shouldn’t need
your announcement, but be readily seen, as if written on your
forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes—just
as the beloved sees it all in the lover’s glance. In short, the straight­
forward and good person should be like a smelly goat—you know
when they are in the room with you. A calculated ‘giving it to
you straight’ is like a dagger. There’s nothing worse than a wolf
befriending sheep. Avoid false friendship at all costs. If you are
good, straightforward, and well-meaning it should show in your
eyes and not escape notice.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.15
“It’s in keeping with Nature to show our friends affection and to
celebrate their advancement, as if it were our very own. For if we
don’t do this, virtue, which is strengthened only by exercising our
perceptions, will no longer endure in us.”

BUILD UP, DON’T TEAR DOWN

i

I

s there a worse environment to work in than one where bullying and
one-upmanship is the norm? Sometimes leaders seem to think that
that is part of the job description—that they are there to regulate and
keep people in line. In truth, tearing people down is incredibly coun­
terproductive. Pete Carroll, coach of the Seattle Seahawks, poses a
question: If self-confidence is so important for players, why would a
coach ever do anything to damage it? Marcus Aurelius, who had the
power to take down anyone at will, almost never did. Instead, he
reminded himself that it was better to build up—be community-minded,
modest, prepared, and tolerant of others. We are made for cooperation
(synergia) and to render works held in common (praxeis koinonikas
apodidonai). Let’s think about that going forward: How can we help
build the self-confidence of others? How can we find some of our own
in doing so?
“So someone’s good at taking down an opponent, but that doesn’t
make them more community-minded, or modest, or well-prepared
for any circumstance, or more tolerant of the faults of others.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.52
“Whenever you have trouble getting up in the morning, remind
yourself that you’ve been made by nature for the purpose of work­
ing with others___And it’s our own natural purpose that is more
fitting and more satisfying.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.12

ACCEPTING WHAT IS

Q einhold Niebuhr’s Serenity Prayer is a mantra for many: “God
Ivgrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage
to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.” The
Stoics wanted to push past simply “accepting” what is—they wanted
to be grateful and happy with what it is. Epictetus taught that we get
a well-flowing life when we wish for what is going to happen not what
we want to happen, and Marcus added that we should meet anything
that comes our way with gratitude. Not “I wish this was different, but
I’ll tolerate it”; instead “I am glad it happened this way. It is for the
best.” Try that on for size this week.
“Don’t seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but
rather wish that everything happens as it actually will—then your
life will flow well.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 8

“To be truly educated means this—learning to wish that each thing
happens exactly as it does.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.12.15

“All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present
moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and
an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that
comes your way.”

THE REAL POWER YOU HAVE

"There is fleeting power and there is real power. Fleeting power can
I be taken away, while real power is in our minds and our bones.
The former tends to be along the lines of wealth, fame, high position,
and the leverage all those things give us over others. The Stoics thought
this kind of power was inferior to the real power that each person
possesses—the power of our minds to reason and make judgments and
choices based on the real worth of things. You can have both kinds of
power, too, but only if you keep the first kind of power subject to the
kind of power the Stoics cared about.
“This is the very thing which makes up the virtue of the happy
person and a well-flowing life—when the affairs of life are in
every way tuned to the harmony between the individual divine
spirit and the will of the director of the universe.”
—Chrysippus, Quoted in Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.88
“Don’t trust in your reputation, money, or position, but in the
strength that is yours—namely, your judgments about the things
that you control and don’t control. For this alone is what makes
us free and unfettered, that picks us up by the neck from the
depths and lifts us eye to eye with the rich and powerful.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.26.34-35
“Understand at last that you have something in you more powerful
and divine than what causes the bodily passions and pulls you like
a mere puppet. What thoughts now occupy my mind? Is it not
fear, suspicion, desire, or something like that?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.19

JUDGE YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS

"inhere is nothing less philosophical than being a know-it-all. This is
I especially true of those who use their knowledge to scold others
for their mistakes while proclaiming the superiority of their knowledge
or insight. The Stoics taught that behaving this way was to miss the
entire purpose of philosophy—as a tool for self-correction, medicine
for our own souls, not a weapon for putting others down. Seneca’s
letters twice employ the metaphor of scrubbing down or scraping off
our faults. We need to see ourselves as “in the care of philosophy’s
principles,” or, as Epictetus put it later when referring to the philoso­
pher’s lecture hall, we need to see it as a hospital for our own therapy.
Don’t let yourself write down a single complaint or problem of another
person in this journal this week—focus on what ails you.
“When philosophy is wielded with arrogance and stubbornly, it is
the cause for the ruin of many. Let philosophy scrape off your own
faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 103.4b-5a

“Some people with exceptional minds quickly grasp virtue or pro­
duce it within themselves. But other dim and lazy types, hindered
by bad habits, must have their rusty souls constantly scrubbed
down. . . . The weaker sorts will be helped and lifted from their
bad opinions if we put them in the care of philosophy’s princi­
ples.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 95.36-37

“Men, the philosopher’s lecture-hall is a hospital—you shouldn’t
walk out of it feeling pleasure, but pain, for you aren’t well when
you enter it.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.30

PRACTICE LETTING GO

\ A/e suffer when we lose things we love, and we suffer most when
Y Y we lose people we love—a natural and unavoidable part of life.
The Stoics say this suffering is increased by our belief that we possess
the objects of our love—that they are, as we like to say, “a part of us.”
This belief doesn’t increase our love and care for them, but rather is a
form of clinging that ignores the simple fact that we don’t control what
will happen, not to our own bodies, let alone to the ones we love. Epic­
tetus taught a powerful exercise that every time you wish a dear child,
family member, or friend good night, remember that these people are
like a precious breakable glass, and remember how dramatically things
could change while you sleep. Marcus, too, struggled to practice this
with his own family as he tucked them in at night. The point isn’t to be
morbid but to create a sense of appreciation and a kind of humility.
Don’t take anyone—especially someone you love—for granted this week.
“Whenever you experience the pangs of losing something, don’t
treat it like a part of yourself but as a breakable glass, so when it
falls you will remember that and won’t be troubled. So, too,
whenever you kiss your child, sibling, or friend, don’t layer on top
of the experience all the things you might wish, but hold them
back and stop them, just as those who ride behind triumphant
generals remind them they are mortal. In the same way, remind
yourself that your precious one isn’t one of your possessions, but
something given for now, not forever.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24.84-86a
“But the wise person can lose nothing. Such a person has every­
thing stored up for themselves, leaving nothing to Fortune, their
own goods are held firm, bound in virtue, which requires nothing
from chance, and therefore can’t be either increased or dimin­
ished.”
—Seneca, On the Firmness of the Wise, 5.4

BALANCE THE BOOKS OF LIFE DAILY

\ A Ae journal as a way of gathering up life’s experiences, insights,
▼ Y frustrations, unexpected struggles and triumphs, and more. In
all of this we are making a reckoning of our progress on life’s way.
Seneca, whose father-in-law was in charge of keeping the books on
Rome’s granary, liked the metaphor of balancing life’s books each day.
Rather than postpone, our impulse each day should be to bring things,
as much as possible, to completion. Why? Because we never know what
tomorrow might bring. Epictetus, too, would tell his students that the
important thing was that they had begun: begun to practice, learn, get
better. Give yourself credit this week for the journey you are on—and
reflect on how far you have come (and how far there is left to go).
“Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life.
Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day.
Life’s greatest flaw is that it’s always imperfect, and a certain
portion of it is postponed. The one who puts the finishing touches
on their life each day is never short of time.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 101.7b-8a

“Believe me, it’s better to produce the balance-sheet of your own
life than that of the grain market.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 18.3b

“I am your teacher and you are learning in my school. My aim is
to bring you to completion, unhindered, free from compulsive
behavior, unrestrained, without shame, free, flourishing, and
happy, looking to God in things great and small—your aim is to
learn and diligently practice all these things. Why then don’t you
complete the work, if you have the right aim and I have both the
right aim and right preparation? What is missing?... The work
is quite feasible, and is the only thing in our power-----Let go of
the past. We must only begin. Believe me and you will see.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.19.29-34

WEEK XLIX
BE STINGY WITH TIME

o

ne of the most common sayings we hear is “life is short.” It is—
but as Seneca remarked, it’s also plenty long if you know how to
use it. The first step to that? Not giving so much of it away to other
people. Becoming miserly about our time is a powerful exercise, which
can keep us from squandering this nonrenewable resource. What in
your life consumes a lot of time for no good purpose? What amuse­
ments and desires consume our time without giving us any good return?
As you review that list, make a commitment to doing something about
it. Life is short, after all; you don’t have too much to spare.
“Were all the geniuses of history to focus on this single theme, they
could never fully express their bafflement at the darkness of the
human mind. No person would give up even an inch of their
estate, and the slightest dispute with a neighbor can mean hell to
pay; yet we easily let others encroach on our lives—worse, we
often pave the way for those who will take it over. No person
hands out their money to passersby, but to how many do each of
us hand out our lives! We’re tight-fisted with property and money,
yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we
should all be the toughest misers.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 3.1-2
“It’s not at all that we have too short a time to live, but that we
squander a great deal of it. Life is long enough, and it’s given in
sufficient measure to do many great things if we spend it well. But
when it’s poured down the drain of luxury and neglect, when it’s
employed to no good end, we’re finally driven to see that it has
passed by before we even recognized it passing. And so it is—we
don’t receive a short life, we make it so.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 1.3-4a

KEEP THE RHYTHM

arcus Aurelius must have known that as emperor he was part of a
I I grand and great history. As a philosopher, he also knew that all
people are part of a rhythm pulsing through both history and their own
lives, and he liked to remind himself to not lose that beat. Return to
your philosophy, he would tell himself when he drifted. Don’t give in to
the distractions. In fact, he tried constantly to return to it. That kind of
awareness (prosoche, paying special attention) is something he learned
from reading Epictetus, who told his students that while none of us can
be perfect, we can catch ourselves when we begin to slide, when we drift
from where we should be. Can you feel that rhythm this week? Can you
point to examples of when you really felt locked into it?
“Walk the long gallery of the past, of empires and kingdoms suc­
ceeding each other without number. And you can also see the
future, for surely it will be exactly the same, unable to deviate
from the present rhythm. It’s all one whether we’ve experienced
forty years or an aeon. What more is there to see?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.49

“When forced, as it seems, by circumstances into utter confusion,
get a hold of yourself quickly. Don’t be locked out of the rhythm
any longer than necessary. You’ll be able to keep the beat if you
are constantly returning to it.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.11

“When you let your attention slide for a bit, don’t think you will
get back a grip on it whenever you wish—instead, bear in mind
that because of today’s mistake everything that follows will be
necessarily worse.... Is it possible to be free from error? Not by
any means, but it is possible to be a person always stretching to
avoid error. For we must be content to at least escape a few mis­
takes by never letting our attention slide.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.12.1; 19

STAKE YOUR CLAIM

w

e like to collect the sayings of great writers or of leaders we
admire—they often become mantras for us on the path of life,
providing guidance and assurance. But as Seneca reminds us, truth
hasn’t been monopolized. We need to spend some time and effort each
week formulating our own wisdom, staking our own claims based on
our study, practice, and training. That’s what this journal is about.
Reflecting on the Stoic wisdom and adding our own to it. Seneca urged
us to blaze our own trail and to take charge and stake our own claim.
Well, let’s do it. Let these pages reflect the insights you have learned by
your own experiences. Let the inspiration you’ve taken from the Stoics
create your own exercises, reminders, and perspectives.
“For it’s disgraceful for an old person, or one in sight of old age, to
have only the knowledge carried in their notebooks. Zeno said
this... what do you say? Cleanthes said that... what do you say?
How long will you be compelled by the claims of another? Take
charge and stake your own claim—something posterity will carry
in its notebook.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 33.7
“Won’t you be walking in your predecessors’ footsteps? I surely
will use the older path, but if I find a shorter and smoother way,
I’ll blaze a trail there. The ones who pioneered these paths aren’t
our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone, it
hasn’t been monopolized.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 33.11
“Don’t act grudgingly, selfishly, without due diligence, or to be a
contrarian. Don’t overdress your thought in fine language. Don’t
be a person of too many words and too many deeds---- Be cheer­
ful, not wanting outside help or the relief others might bring. A
person needs to stand on their own, not be propped up.”

TURN WORDS INTO WORKS

arcus spent a great deal of time on his journals, yet within their
I I pages we find him admonishing himself to throw them away, to
never read their pages. Why? Because he didn’t want them to be an
excuse from the essential tasks at hand. The art of living will never be
found anywhere but in our own efforts to be a good person. Never
forget that is the aim of this journal. It is not to fill up pages with pretty
thoughts but to inspire you to take action, to turn the words, as Seneca
said, into works. In that we have the perfect place to end this year, with
the ultimate Stoic prompt: Get active in your own rescue.
“Stop wandering about! You aren’t likely to read your own note­
books, or ancient histories, or the anthologies you’ve collected to
enjoy in your old age. Get busy with life’s purpose, toss aside
empty hopes, get active in your own rescue—if you care for your­
self at all—and do it while you can.”
—marcus aurelius, Meditations, 3.14
“You have proof in the extent of your wanderings that you never
found the art of living anywhere—not in logic, nor in wealth,
fame, or in any indulgence. Nowhere. Where is it then? In doing
what human nature demands. How is a person to do this? By
having principles be the source of desire and action. What prin­
ciples? Those to do with good and evil, indeed in the belief that
there is no good for a human being except what creates justice,
self-control, courage, and freedom, and nothing evil except what
destroys these things.”
—MARCUS AURELIUS, Meditations, 8.1.(5)
“All study of philosophy and reading should be for the purpose of
living a happy life ... we should seek precepts to help us, noble
and courageous words that can become facts... we should learn
them in a way that words become works.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 108.35

\ A /hile this journal was designed to be the ultimate companion for
Y Y The Daily Stoic, and The Daily Stoic was designed to be read as
many times as a reader would like, you might well be looking for even
more prompts and Stoic readings, especially if this is your second go
around with the journal. That is something we are happy to provide.
First, we send out a free e-mail every single day of Stoic wisdom at
DailyStoic.com. If you haven’t signed up yet, you absolutely should!
Second, if you’re looking for some classic and modern Stoic texts to
journal along to, we have some recommendations:
• Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (we strongly recommend the
Gregory Hays translation for Modern Library)
• Letters of a Stoic by Seneca (the abridged Penguin Classics edi­
tion is wonderful and there is also a full—and free—e-book edi­
tion put out by Tim Ferriss)
• Discourses and Selected Writings by Epictetus (again, hard to do
better than Penguin Classics)
• The Inner Citadel: The Meditations ofMarcus Aurelius by Pierre
Hadot (this is a wonderful deep dive into Marcus Aurelius’s phi­
losophy and what makes him tick)
• The Moral Sayings of Publilius Syrus: A Roman Slave by Publilius
Syrus (another slave turned philosopher whose pithy epigrams
will give you something to write about each day)
If you want to learn more about Stoic exercises and practices, and
their purpose, we like the following sources:
• Chapter 3 in Pierre Hadot’s Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiri­
tual Exercises from Socrates to Foucault (Wiley-Blackwell,
1995)
• Chapters 15-16 in Richard Sorabji’s Emotion and Peace of
Mind: From Stoic Agitation to Christian Temptation (Oxford
University Press, 2000)
