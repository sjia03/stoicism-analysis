On the Shortness of Life

\
(i.i) Most of mankind, Paulinus, complains about natures meanness, \
because our allotted span of life is so short, and because this stretch \
of time that is given to us runs its course so quickly, so rapidly \'97 so \
much so that, with very few exceptions, life leaves the rest of us in \
the lurch just when we re getting ready to live. And its not just the \
masses and the unthinking crowd that complain at what they per- \
ceive as this universal evil; the same feeling draws complaints even \
from men of distinction. Hence that famous dictum of the greatest \
of physicians: "Life is short, art long." 1 (2) Hence also Aristotle's \
grievance, 2 most unbecoming a philosopher, when he called nature \
to account for bestowing so much time on animals that they can live \
for five or ten human life spans, while so much shorter a limit is set \
for humans, even though they are born to do so many great things. \
\
(3) It's not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste \
much of it. Life is long enough, and it's been given to us in generous \
measure for accomplishing the greatest things, if the whole of it is \
well invested. But when life is squandered through soft and careless \
living, and when it's spent on no worthwhile pursuit, death finally \
presses and we realize that the life which we didn't notice passing \
has passed away. (4) So it is: the life we are given isn't short but we \
make it so; we're not ill provided but we are wasteful of life. Just as \
impressive and princely wealth is squandered in an instant when it \
passes into the hands of a poor manager, but wealth however modest \
grows through careful deployment if it is entrusted to a responsible \
guardian, just so our lifetime offers ample scope to the person who \
maps it out well. \
\
(2.1) Why do we complain about nature? It has acted generously: \
life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one person's held in the \
grip of voracious avarice, another by the kind of diligence that bus- \
ies itself with pointless enterprises. This one's sodden with wine, \
another slack with idleness. This one's tired out by his political ambi- \
tion, which always hangs on the judgment of others, while another's \
passionate desire for trading drives him headlong over every land \
\
\
\
and every sea in hope of profit. A passion for soldiering torments \
some men, who are always either bent on inflicting dangers on oth- \
ers or worried about danger to themselves. Some are worn down \
by the voluntary enslavement of thankless attendance on the great. \
(2) Many are kept busy either striving after other people's wealth or \
complaining about their own. Many who have no consistent goal in \
life are thrown from one new design to another by a fickleness that is \
shifting, never settled and ever dissatisfied with itself. Some have no \
goal at all toward which to steer their course, but death takes them \
by surprise as they gape and yawn. I cannot therefore doubt the truth \
of that seemingly oracular utterance of the greatest of poets: "Scant \
is the part of life in which we live." 3 All the rest of existence is not \
living but merely time. \
\
(3) Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don't allow \
us to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth; \
but they press down on them, keeping them lowered and fixed on \
mere desire. It's never possible for their victims to return to their \
true selves. If by chance they ever find some respite, they still roll \
restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind \
has settled; they never find full relaxation from their desires. (4) You \
think I'm talking only of those whose faults are admitted? Look at \
those whose prosperity draws crowds: they are choked by their own \
goods. How many have found their wealth a burden! How many are \
drained of their blood by their eloquence and their daily preoccupa- \
tion with showing off their abilities! How many are sickly pale from \
their incessant pleasures! How many are left with no freedom from \
the multitude of their besieging clients! In short, look over all of \
them from lowest to highest: this person summons counsel to plead \
his case, another answers the call; this one stands trial, another acts \
for the defense, another presides as judge; no one acts as his own \
champion, but each is wasted for another's sake. Ask about those in- \
fluential citizens whose names are studiously memorized, and you'll \
see that the following distinctions tell them apart: the first cultivates \
a second, the second a third; no one is his own man. (5) Again certain \
people give vent to the most irrational outbursts of anger: they com- \
plain about the haughtiness of their superiors, because the latter were \
too busy to receive them when they wanted an audience. Dare anyone \
complain about another's arrogance when he himself never has time \
\
\
\
to spare for himself? Yet the great man has occasionally, albeit with a \
disdainful expression, condescended to look on you, whoever you are; \
he has deigned to listen to your words, he has allowed you to walk \
at his side. But you never thought fit to look on yourself or to listen \
to yourself. And so you've no reason to expect a return from anyone \
for those attentions of yours, since you offered them not because you \
wanted another's company but because you were incapable of com- \
muning with yourself. \
\
(3.1) Though all the brilliant minds that have shone over the ages \
agree on this one point, they could never adequately express their \
astonishment at this dark fog in the human mind. No one lets anyone \
seize his estates, and if a trivial dispute arises about boundary lines, \
there's a rush to stones and arms; but people let others trespass on \
their existence \'97 or rather, they go so far as to invite in those who'll \
take possession of their lives. You'll find no one willing to distribute \
his money; but to how many people each of us shares out his life! \
Men are thrifty in guarding their private property, but as soon as it \
comes to wasting time, they are most extravagant with the one com- \
modity for which it's respectable to be greedy. \
\
(2) And so I'd like to collar one of the older crowd: "I see that \
you've reached the limit of human life, you're pressing hard on your \
hundredth year or more; come now, submit your life to an audit. Cal- \
culate how much of your time has been taken up by a moneylender, \
how much by a mistress, how much by a patron, how much by a cli- \
ent, how much in arguing with your wife, in punishing your slaves, in \
running about the city on social duties. Add to your calculations the \
illnesses that we've inflicted on ourselves, and also the time that has \
lain idle: you'll see that you've fewer years than you count. (3) Look \
back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few \
days turned out as you'd intended; when you were ever at your own \
disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind \
was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in \
such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without \
your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been \
lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms \
of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You'll \
come to realize that you're dying before your time." \
\
(4) What, then, is the reason for this? Your sort live as if you're \
\
\
\
going to live forever, your own human frailty never enters your head, \
you don't keep an eye on how much time has passed already. You \
waste time as if it comes from a source full to overflowing, when all \
the while that very day which is given over to someone or something \
may be your last. You're like ordinary mortals in fearing everything, \
you're like immortals in coveting everything. (5) You'll hear many say: \
"After my fiftieth year I'll retire to a life of leisure; my sixtieth year \
will bring release from all my duties." And what guarantee, may I \
ask, do you have that your life will last longer? Who will allow those \
arrangements of yours to proceed according to plan? Are you not \
ashamed to keep for yourself only the remnants of your existence, and \
to allocate to philosophical thought only that portion of time which \
can't be applied to any business? How late it is to begin living just \
when life must come to an end! What foolish obliviousness to our \
mortality to put off wise plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth year, and to \
want to begin life from a point that few have reached! \
\
(4.1) You'll find that the most powerful men of high position \
drop words in which they pray for leisure, praise it, and prefer it to \
all their blessings. They sometimes long to step down from that pin- \
nacle of theirs, if they can safely do so; for even without any external \
disturbance or shock, fortune crashes down on itself under its own \
weight. \
\
(2) The divine Augustus, to whom the gods gave more than to \
any man, never ceased to pray for rest for himself and to seek release \
from the affairs of state. Every conversation of his kept coming back \
to this theme, that he was hoping for leisure; he would relieve his \
toils with this sweet, even if illusory, consolation, the thought that \
one day he would live for himself. (3) In a letter that he sent to the \
senate, when he had given an assurance that his retirement would \
not be wanting in dignity and not be inconsistent with his former \
prestige, I find the following words: "But such things are more im- \
pressive in their fulfillment than in their promise. Yet my deep desire \
for that time, which I have long prayed for, has led me to anticipate \
something of its delight by the pleasure of words, since the joy of \
that reality is still slow in coming." 4 (4) Leisure seemed such a desir- \
able thing that, because he couldn't enjoy it in reality, he enjoyed the \
thought of it in advance. He who saw\'85}
