PREFACE

It was the late first century AD and Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Rome’s
most influential power broker, its greatest living playwright, and
its wisest philosopher, was struggling to work.
The problem was the ear-shattering, soul-rattling noise that
poured in from the street below.
Rome had always been a loud city—think New York City
construction loud—but the block where Seneca was staying was a
deafening cacophony of disturbances. Athletes worked out in the
gymnasium underneath his suite of rooms, dropping heavy weights.
A masseuse pummeled the backs of old fat men. Swimmers splashed
in the water. At the entrance of the building, a pickpocket was being
arrested and making a scene. Passing carriages rumbled over the
stone streets, while carpenters hammered away in their shops and
vendors shouted their wares. Children laughed and played. Dogs
barked.
And more than the noise outside his window, there was the
simple fact that Seneca’s life was falling apart. It was crisis upon
crisis upon crisis. Overseas unrest threatened his finances. He was
getting older and could feel it. He had been pushed out of politics by
his enemies, and, now on the outs with Nero, he could easily—at the
emperor’s whim—lose his head.
It was not, we can imagine from the perspective of our own busy
lives, a great environment for a human to get anything done.
Unconducive to thinking, creating, writing, or making good
decisions. The noise and distractions of the empire were enough “to
make me hate my very powers of hearing,” Seneca told a friend.

Yet for good reason, this scene has tantalized admirers for
centuries. How does a man, besieged by adversity and difficulty, not
only not go out of his mind, but actually find the serenity to think
clearly and to write incisive, perfectly crafted essays, some in that
very room, which would reach millions upon millions and touch on
truths that few have ever accessed?
“I have toughened my nerves against all that sort of thing,”
Seneca explained to that same friend about the noise. “I force my
mind to concentrate, and keep it from straying to things outside
itself; all outdoors may be bedlam, provided that there is no
disturbance within.”
Ah, isn’t that what we all crave? What discipline! What focus! To
be able to tune out our surroundings, to access one’s full capabilities
at any time, in any place, despite every difficulty? How wonderful
that would be! What we’d be able to accomplish! How much happier
we would be!
To Seneca and to his fellow adherents of Stoic philosophy, if a
person could develop peace within themselves—if they could achieve
apatheia, as they called it—then the whole world could be at war,
and they could still think well, work well, and be well. “You may be
sure that you are at peace with yourself,” Seneca wrote, “when no
noise reaches you, when no word shakes you out of yourself, whether
it be flattery or a threat, or merely an empty sound buzzing about you
with unmeaning sin.” In this state, nothing could touch them (not
even a deranged emperor), no emotion could disturb them, no threat
could interrupt them, and every beat of the present moment would
be theirs for living.
It’s a powerful idea made all the more transcendent by the
remarkable fact that nearly every other philosophy of the ancient
world—no matter how different or distant—came to the exact same
conclusion.
It wouldn’t have mattered whether you were a pupil at the feet of
Confucius in 500 BC, a student of the early Greek philosopher
Democritus one hundred years later, or sitting in Epicurus’s garden a
generation after that—you would have heard equally emphatic calls
for this imperturbability, unruffledness, and tranquility.

The Buddhist word for it was upekkha. The Muslims spoke of
aslama. The Hebrews, hishtavut. The second book of the Bhagavad
Gita, the epic poem of the warrior Arjuna, speaks of samatvam, an
“evenness of mind—a peace that is ever the same.” The Greeks,
euthymia and hesychia. The Epicureans, ataraxia. The Christians,
aequanimitas.
In English: stillness.
To be steady while the world spins around you. To act without
frenzy. To hear only what needs to be heard. To possess quietude—
exterior and interior—on command.
To tap into the dao and the logos. The Word. The Way.
Buddhism. Stoicism. Epicureanism. Christianity. Hinduism. It’s
all but impossible to find a philosophical school or religion that does
not venerate this inner peace—this stillness—as the highest good and
as the key to elite performance and a happy life.
And when basically all the wisdom of the ancient world agrees on
something, only a fool would decline to listen.

INTRODUCTION

T

he call to stillness comes quietly. The modern world does not.
In addition to the clatter and chatter and intrigue and
infighting that would be familiar to the citizens of Seneca’s time, we
have car horns, stereos, cell phone alarms, social media notifications,
chainsaws, airplanes.
Our personal and professional problems are equally
overwhelming. Competitors muscle into our industry. Our desks pile
high with papers and our inboxes overflow with messages. We are
always reachable, which means that arguments and updates are
never far away. The news bombards us with one crisis after another
on every screen we own—of which there are many. The grind of work
wears us down and seems to never stop. We are overfed and
undernourished. Overstimulated, overscheduled, and lonely.
Who has the power to stop? Who has time to think? Is there
anyone not affected by the din and dysfunctions of our time?
While the magnitude and urgency of our struggle is modern, it is
rooted in a timeless problem. Indeed, history shows that the ability
to cultivate quiet and quell the turmoil inside us, to slow the mind
down, to understand our emotions, and to conquer our bodies has
always been extremely difficult. “All of humanity’s problems,” Blaise
Pascal said in 1654, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a
room alone.”
In evolution, distinct species—like birds and bats—have often
evolved similar adaptations in order to survive. The same goes for
the philosophical schools separated by vast oceans and distances.
They developed unique paths to the same critical destination: The

stillness required to become master of one’s own life. To survive and
thrive in any and every environment, no matter how loud or busy.
Which is why this idea of stillness is not some soft New Age
nonsense or the domain of monks and sages, but in fact desperately
necessary to all of us, whether we’re running a hedge fund or playing
in a Super Bowl, pioneering research in a new field or raising a
family. It is an attainable path to enlightenment and excellence,
greatness and happiness, performance as well as presence, for every
kind of person.
Stillness is what aims the archer’s arrow. It inspires new ideas. It
sharpens perspective and illuminates connections. It slows the ball
down so that we might hit it. It generates a vision, helps us resist the
passions of the mob, makes space for gratitude and wonder. Stillness
allows us to persevere. To succeed. It is the key that unlocks the
insights of genius, and allows us regular folks to understand them.
The promise of this book is the location of that key . . . and a call
not only for possessing stillness, but for radiating it outward like a
star—like the sun—for a world that needs light more than ever.

The Key to Everything
In the early days of the American Civil War, there were a hundred
competing plans for how to secure victory and whom to appoint to do
it. From every general and for every battle there was an endless
supply of criticism and dangerous passions—there was paranoia and
fear, ego and arrogance, and very little in the way of hope.
There is a wonderful scene from those fraught first moments
when Abraham Lincoln addressed a group of generals and politicians
in his office at the White House. Most people at that time believed
the war could only be won through enormous, decisively bloody
battles in the country’s biggest cities, like Richmond and New
Orleans and even, potentially, Washington, D.C.
Lincoln, a man who taught himself military strategy by poring
over books he checked out from the Library of Congress, laid out a
map across a big table and pointed instead to Vicksburg, Mississippi,
a little city deep in Southern territory. It was a fortified town high on

the bluffs of the Mississippi River, held by the toughest rebel troops.
Not only did it control navigation of that important waterway, but it
was a juncture for a number of other important tributaries, as well as
rail lines that supplied Confederate armies and enormous slave
plantations across the South.
“Vicksburg is the key,” he told the crowd with the certainty of a
man who had studied a matter so intensely that he could express it in
the simplest of terms. “The war can never be brought to a close until
that key is in our pocket.”
As it happened, Lincoln turned out to be exactly right. It would
take years, it would take incredible equanimity and patience, as well
as ferocious commitment to his cause, but the strategy laid out in
that room was what won the war and ended slavery in America
forever. Every other important victory in the Civil War—from
Gettysburg to Sherman’s March to the Sea to Lee’s surrender—was
made possible because at Lincoln’s instruction Ulysses S. Grant laid
siege to Vicksburg in 1863, and by taking the city split the South in
two and gained control of that important waterway. In his reflective,
intuitive manner, without being rushed or distracted, Lincoln had
seen (and held fast to) what his own advisors, and even his enemy,
had missed. Because he possessed the key that unlocked victory from
the rancor and folly of all those early competing plans.
In our own lives, we face a seemingly equal number of problems
and are pulled in countless directions by competing priorities and
beliefs. In the way of everything we hope to accomplish, personally
and professionally, sit obstacles and enemies. Martin Luther King Jr.
observed that there was a violent civil war raging within each and
every person—between our good and bad impulses, between our
ambitions and our principles, between what we can be and how hard
it is to actually get there.
In those battles, in that war, stillness is the river and the railroad
junction through which so much depends. It is the key . . .
To thinking clearly.
To seeing the whole chessboard.
To making tough decisions.
To managing our emotions.

To identifying the right goals.
To handling high-pressure situations.
To maintaining relationships.
To building good habits.
To being productive.
To physical excellence.
To feeling fulfilled.
To capturing moments of laughter and joy.
Stillness is the key to, well, just about everything.
To being a better parent, a better artist, a better investor, a better
athlete, a better scientist, a better human being. To unlocking all that
we are capable of in this life.

This Stillness Can Be Yours
Anyone who has concentrated so deeply that a flash of insight or
inspiration suddenly visited them knows stillness. Anyone who has
given their best to something, felt pride of completion, of knowing
they left absolutely nothing in reserve—that’s stillness. Anyone who
has stepped forward with the eyes of the crowd upon them and then
poured all their training into a single moment of performance—that’s
stillness, even if it involves active movement. Anyone who has spent
time with that special, wise person, and witnessed them solve in two
seconds the problem that had vexed us for months—stillness. Anyone
who has walked out alone on a quiet street at night as the snow fell,
and watched as the light fell softly on that snow and is warmed by the
contentment of being alive—that too is stillness.
Staring at the blank page in front of us and watching as the words
pour out in perfect prose, at a loss for where they came from;
standing on fine white sand, looking out at the ocean, or really any
part of nature, and feeling like part of something bigger than oneself;
a quiet evening with a loved one; the satisfaction of having done a
good turn for another person; sitting, alone with our thoughts, and
seizing for the first time the ability to think about them as we were
thinking them. Stillness.

Sure, there is a certain ineffableness to what we’re talking about,
to articulating the stillness that the poet Rainer Maria Rilke
described as “full, complete” where “all the random and approximate
were muted.”
“Although we speak of attaining the dao,” Lao Tzu once said,
“there is really nothing to obtain.” Or to borrow a master’s reply to a
student who asked where he might find Zen: “You are seeking for an
ox while you are yourself on it.”
You have tasted stillness before. You have felt it in your soul. And
you want more of it.
You need more of it.
Which is why the aim of this book is simply to show how to
uncover and draw upon the stillness we already possess. It’s about
the cultivation of and the connection to that powerful force given to
us at birth, the one that has atrophied in our modern, busy lives. This
book is an attempt to answer the pressing question of our time: If the
quiet moments are the best moments, and if so many wise, virtuous
people have sung their praises, why are they so rare?
Well, the answer is that while we may naturally possess stillness,
accessing it is not easy. One must really listen to hear it speaking to
us. And answering the call requires stamina and mastery. “To hold
the mind still is an enormous discipline,” the late comedian Garry
Shandling reminded himself in his journal as he struggled to manage
fame and fortune and health problems, “one which must be faced
with the greatest commitment of your life.”
The pages that follow tell the stories and strategies of men and
women who were just like you, who struggled as you struggle amid
the noise and responsibilities of life, but managed to succeed in
finding and harnessing stillness. You will hear stories of the triumphs
and trials of John F. Kennedy and Fred Rogers, Anne Frank and
Queen Victoria. There will be stories about Jesus and Tiger Woods,
Socrates, Napoleon, the composer John Cage, Sadaharu Oh, Rosanne
Cash, Dorothy Day, Buddha, Leonardo da Vinci, Socrates, and
Marcus Aurelius.
We will also draw on poetry and novels, philosophical texts and
scientific research. We will raid every school and every era we can to
find strategies to help us direct our thoughts, process our emotions,

and master our bodies. So we can do less . . . and do more.
Accomplish more but need it less. Feel better and be better at the
same time.
To achieve stillness, we’ll need to focus on three domains, the
timeless trinity of mind, body, soul—the head, the heart, the flesh.
In each domain, we will seek to reduce the disturbances and
perturbations that make stillness impossible. To cease to be at war
with the world and within ourselves, and to establish a lasting inner
and outer peace instead.
You know that is what you want—and what you deserve. That’s
why you picked up this book.
So let us answer the call together. Let us find—let us lock into—
the stillness that we seek.

THE DOMAIN OF THE MIND

T

he entire world changed in the few short hours between when
John F. Kennedy went to bed on October 15, 1962, and when he
woke up the following morning.
Because while the president slept, the CIA identified the ongoing
construction of medium- and long-range Soviet ballistic nuclear
missile sites on the island of Cuba, just ninety miles from American
shores. As Kennedy would tell a stunned American public days later,
“Each of these missiles is capable of striking Washington, D.C., the
Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the
southeastern part of the United States, in Central America, or in the
Caribbean.”
As Kennedy received his first briefing on what we now know as
the Cuban Missile Crisis—or simply as the Thirteen Days—the
president could consider only the appalling stakes. As many as
seventy million people were expected to die in the first strikes
between the United States and Russia. But that was just a guess—no
one actually knew how terrible nuclear war would be.
What Kennedy knew for certain was that he faced an
unprecedented escalation of the long-brewing Cold War between the
United States and the USSR. And whatever factors had contributed
to its creation, no matter how inevitable war must have appeared, it
fell on him, at the very least, to just not make things worse. Because
it might mean the end of life on planet Earth.
Kennedy was a young president born into immense privilege,
raised by an aggressive father who hated to lose, in a family whose
motto, they joked, was “Don’t Get Mad, Get Even.” With almost no
executive leadership experience under his belt, it’s not a surprise,

then, that the first year and half of Kennedy’s administration had not
gone well.
In April 1961, Kennedy had tried and failed—embarrassingly so—
to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs. Just a
few months later, he was diplomatically dominated by Soviet premier
Nikita Khrushchev in a series of meetings in Vienna. (Kennedy would
call it the “roughest thing in my life.”) Sensing his adversary’s
political weakness, and likely aware of the chronic physical frailty he
endured from Addison’s disease and back injuries suffered during
World War II, Khrushchev repeatedly lied to Kennedy about any
weapons being placed in Cuba, insisting that they would be for
defensive purposes only.
Which is to say that during the Missile Crisis, Kennedy faced, as
every leader will at some point in their tenure, a difficult test amid
complicating personal and political circumstances. There were many
questions: Why would Khrushchev do this? What was his endgame?
What was the man possibly trying to accomplish? Was there a way to
solve it? What did Kennedy’s advisors think? What were Kennedy’s
options? Was he up to this task? Did he have what it took?
The fate of millions depended on his answers.
The advice from Kennedy’s advisors was immediate and
emphatic: The missile sites must be destroyed with the full might of
the country’s military arsenal. Every second wasted risked the safety
and the reputation of the United States. After the surprise attack on
the missiles, a full-scale invasion of Cuba by American troops would
need to follow. This, they said, was not only more than justified by
the actions of the USSR and Cuba, but it was Kennedy’s only option.
Their logic was both primal and satisfying: Aggression must be
met with aggression. Tit replied to with tat.
The only problem was that if their logic turned out to be wrong,
no one would be around to account for their mistake. Because
everyone would be dead.
Unlike in the early days of his presidency, when Kennedy allowed
the CIA to pressure him into supporting the Bay of Pigs fiasco, this
time he surprised everyone by pushing back. He had recently read
Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August, a book about the beginning
of World War I, which imprinted on his mind the image of

overconfident world leaders rushing their way into a conflict that,
once started, they couldn’t stop. Kennedy wanted everyone to slow
down so that they could really think about the problem in front of
them.
This is, in fact, the first obligation of a leader and a decision
maker. Our job is not to “go with our gut” or fixate on the first
impression we form about an issue. No, we need to be strong enough
to resist thinking that is too neat, too plausible, and therefore almost
always wrong. Because if the leader can’t take the time to develop a
clear sense of the bigger picture, who will? If the leader isn’t thinking
through all the way to the end, who is?
We can see in Kennedy’s handwritten notes taken during the
crisis, a sort of meditative process by which he tried to do precisely
this. On numerous pages, he writes “Missile. Missile. Missile,” or
“Veto. Veto. Veto. Veto,” or “Leaders. Leaders. Leaders.” On one
page, showing his desire to not act alone or selfishly: “Consensus.
Consensus. Consensus. Consensus. Consensus. Consensus.” On a
yellow legal pad during one meeting, Kennedy drew two sailboats,
calming himself with thoughts of the ocean he loved so much.
Finally, on White House stationery, as if to clarify to himself the only
thing that mattered, he wrote one short sentence: “We are
demanding withdrawal of the missiles.”
Perhaps it was there, as Kennedy sat with his advisors and
doodled, that he remembered a passage from another book he’d
read, by the strategist B. H. Liddell Hart, on nuclear strategy. In
Kennedy’s review of Hart’s book for the Saturday Review of
Literature a few years before, he quoted this passage:
Keep strong, if possible. In any case, keep cool. Have
unlimited patience. Never corner an opponent, and always
assist him to save face. Put yourself in his shoes—so as to
see things through his eyes. Avoid self-righteousness like
the devil—nothing is so self-blinding.
It became Kennedy’s motto during the Missile Crisis. “I think we
ought to think of why the Russians did this,” he told his advisors.

What is the advantage they are trying to get? he asked, with real
interest. “Must be some major reason for the Soviets to set this up.”
As Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Kennedy’s advisor and biographer, wrote,
“With his capacity to understand the problems of others, the
President could see how threatening the world might have looked to
the Kremlin.”
This understanding would help him respond properly to this
unexpected and dangerous provocation—and give him insight into
how the Soviets would react to that response.
It became clear to Kennedy that Khrushchev put the missiles in
Cuba because he believed Kennedy was weak. But that didn’t mean
the Russians believed their own position was particularly strong.
Only a desperate nation would take such a risk, Kennedy realized.
Armed with this insight, which came through long discussions with
his team—designated as ExComm—he began to formulate an action
plan.
Clearly, a military strike was the most irrevocable of all the
options (nor, according to his advisors, was it likely to be 100 percent
effective). What would happen after that, Kennedy wondered? How
many soldiers would die in an invasion? How would the world
respond to a larger country invading a smaller one, even if it was to
deter a nuclear threat? What would the Russians do to save face or
protect their soldiers on the island?
These questions pointed Kennedy toward a blockade of Cuba.
Nearly half of his advisors opposed this less aggressive move, but he
favored it precisely because it preserved his options.
The blockade also embodied the wisdom of one of Kennedy’s
favorite expressions: It used time as a tool. It gave both sides a
chance to examine the stakes of the crisis and offered Khrushchev
the opportunity to reevaluate his impression of Kennedy’s supposed
weakness.
Some would later attack Kennedy for this choice, too. Why
challenge Russia at all? Why were the missiles such a big deal? Didn’t
the United States have plenty of their own pointed at the Soviets?
Kennedy was not unsympathetic to this argument, but as he
explained to the American public in an address on October 22, it
wasn’t possible to simply back down:

The 1930s taught us a clear lesson: Aggressive conduct, if
allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately
leads to war. This nation is opposed to war. We are also
true to our word. Our unswerving objective, therefore,
must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or
any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or
elimination from the Western Hemisphere. . . . We will not
prematurely or unnecessarily risk the costs of worldwide
nuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would be
ashes in our mouth—but neither will we shrink from that
risk at any time it must be faced.
What’s most remarkable about this conclusion is how calmly
Kennedy came to it. Despite the enormous stress of the situation, we
can hear in tapes and see in transcripts and photos taken at the time
just how collaborative and open everyone was. No fighting, no raised
voices. No finger-pointing (and when things did get tense, Kennedy
laughed it off). Kennedy didn’t let his own ego dominate the
discussions, nor did he allow anyone else’s to. When he sensed that
his presence was stifling his advisors’ ability to speak honestly, he left
the room so they could debate and brainstorm freely. Reaching
across party lines and past rivalries, he consulted openly with the
three still-living ex-presidents and invited the previous secretary of
state, Dean Acheson, into the top-secret meetings as an equal.
In the tensest moments, Kennedy sought solitude in the White
House Rose Garden (afterward, he would thank the gardener for her
important contributions during the crisis). He would go for long
swims, both to clear his mind and to think. He sat in his specially
made rocking chair in the Oval Office, bathed in the light of those
enormous windows, easing the pain in his back so that it might not
add to the fog of (cold) war that had descended so thickly over
Washington and Moscow.
There is a picture of Kennedy with his back to the room, hunched
over, leaning both fists on the big desk he had been chosen by
millions of voters to occupy. This is a man with the fate of the world
on his shoulders. He has been provoked by a nuclear superpower in a
surprise act of bad faith. Critics are questioning his courage. There

are political considerations, personal considerations, there are more
factors than any one person should be able to weigh at one time.
Yet he lets none of this rush him. None of it will cloud his
judgment or deter him from doing the right thing. He is the stillest
guy in the room.
Kennedy would need to stay that way, because simply deciding on
the blockade was only the first step. Next came announcing and
enforcing this five-hundred-mile no-go zone around Cuba (which he
brilliantly called a “quarantine” to underplay the more aggressive
implications of a “blockade”). There would be more belligerent
accusations from the Russians and confrontations at the UN.
Congressional leaders voiced their doubts. One hundred thousand
troops still had to be readied in Florida as a contingency.
Then there would be the actual provocations. A Russian tanker
ship approached the quarantine line. Russian submarines surfaced.
An American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Cuba, and the pilot
killed.
The two biggest and most powerful countries in the world were
“eyeball to eyeball.” It was actually scarier and more dire than
anyone knew—some of the Soviet missiles, which had been
previously thought to be only partly assembled, were armed and
ready. Even if this wasn’t known, the awful danger could be felt.
Would Kennedy’s emotions get the best of him? Would he blink?
Would he break?
No. He wouldn’t.
“It isn’t the first step that concerns me,” he said to his advisors as
much as to himself, “but both sides escalating to the fourth and fifth
step—and we don’t go to the sixth because there is no one around to
do so. We must remind ourselves we are embarking on a very
hazardous course.”
The space Kennedy gave Khrushchev to breathe and think paid
off just in time. On October 26, eleven days into the crisis, the Soviet
premier wrote Kennedy a letter saying that he now saw that the two
of them were pulling on a rope with a knot in the middle—a knot of
war. The harder each pulled, the less likely it would be that they
could ever untie it, and eventually there would be no choice but to
cut the rope with a sword. And then Khrushchev provided an even

more vivid analogy, one as true in geopolitics as it is in everyday life:
“If people do not display statesmanlike wisdom,” he said, “they will
eventually reach the point where they will clash, like blind moles,
and then mutual annihilation will commence.”
Suddenly, the crisis was over as quickly as it began. The Russians,
realizing that their position was untenable and that their test of U.S.
resolve had failed, made signs that they would negotiate—that they
would remove the missiles. The ships stopped dead in the water.
Kennedy was ready too. He pledged that the United States would not
invade Cuba, giving the Russians and their allies a win. In secret, he
also let the Russians know that he was willing to remove American
missiles in Turkey, but would do so in several months’ time so as not
to give the impression that he could be pressured into abandoning an
ally.
With clear thinking, wisdom, patience, and a keen eye for the root
of a complex, provocative conflict, Kennedy had saved the world
from a nuclear holocaust.
We might say that Kennedy, if only for this brief period of a little
less than two weeks, managed to achieve that stage of clarity spoken
about in the ancient Chinese text The Daodejing. As he stared down
nuclear annihilation, he was:
Careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream.
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.
Courteous as a guest.
Fluid as melting ice.
Shapable as a block of wood.
Receptive as a valley.
Clear as a glass of water.
The Daoists would say that he had stilled the muddied water in
his mind until he could see through it. Or to borrow the image from
the emperor Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic philosopher who himself had
stared down countless crises and challenges, Kennedy had been “like
the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands, unmoved and
the raging of the sea falls still around it.”

Each of us will, in our own lives, face crisis. The stakes may be
lower, but to us they will matter. A business on the brink of collapse.
An acrimonious divorce. A decision about the future of our career. A
moment where the whole game depends on us. These situations will
call upon all our mental resources. An emotional, reactive response—
an unthinking, half-baked response—will not cut it. Not if we want to
get it right. Not if we want to perform at our best.
What we will need then is that same stillness that Kennedy drew
upon. His calmness. His open-mindedness. His empathy. His clarity
about what really mattered.
In these situations we must:
Be fully present.
Empty our mind of preconceptions.
Take our time.
Sit quietly and reflect.
Reject distraction.
Weigh advice against the counsel of our convictions.
Deliberate without being paralyzed.
We must cultivate mental stillness to succeed in life and to
successfully navigate the many crises it throws our way.
It will not be easy. But it is essential.
For the rest of his short life, Kennedy worried that people would
learn the wrong lessons from his actions during the Missile Crisis. It
wasn’t that he had stood up to the Soviets and threatened them with
superior weapons until they backed down. Instead, calm and rational
leadership had prevailed over rasher, reckless voices. The crisis was
resolved thanks to a mastery of his own thinking, and the thinking of
those underneath him—and it was these traits that America would
need to call on repeatedly in the years to come. The lesson was one
not of force but of the power of patience, alternating confidence and
humility, foresight and presence, empathy and unbending
conviction, restraint and toughness, and quiet solitude combined
with wise counsel.

How much better would the world be with more of this behavior?
How much better would your own life be?
Kennedy, like Lincoln, was not born with this stillness. He was a
defiant troublemaker in high school, a dilettante for most of college
and even as a senator. He had his demons and he made plenty of
mistakes. But with hard work—work you are capable of doing too—
he overcame those shortcomings and developed the equanimity that
served him so well over those terrifying thirteen days. It was work in
just a few categories that nearly everyone else neglects.
Which is where we will now turn our focus—toward mastering
what we will call in this section “the domain of the mind”—because
everything we do depends on getting that right.

he decision in 2010 to title Marina Abramović’s four-decade
retrospective at MoMA in New York City The Artist Is Present all
but preordained the monumental performance that would come out
of it. Naturally, Marina would have to be present in one way or
another.
But no one would have dared think that she would literally be
there . . . for all of it.
Who could conceive that a human could sit silently in a chair,
completely still, for a total of 750 hours over 79 days directly across
from 1,545 strangers, without aid, without distraction, without so
much as a way to go to the bathroom? That she would want to do
this? That she would pull it off?
As her former lover and collaborator Ulay said when he was
asked what he thought of the possibility, “I have no thoughts. Only
respect.”
The performance was as simple as it was straightforward. Marina,
aged sixty-three, her long hair braided and over her shoulder, walked
into the cavernous room, sat down in a hard wooden chair, and
simply stared at the person across from her. One after another they

came, hour after hour, day in and day out, for nearly three months.
Each time, she looked down, gathered herself, and then looked up
afresh at the new face.
As Marina would say of her art, “The proposition here is just to
empty the self. To be able to be present.”
Is it really that hard—to be present? What’s so special about that?
No one who was in the audience, who sat across from her, would
ask such questions. For those souls lucky enough to see the
performance in person, it was a near religious experience. To
experience another person fully in the moment is a rare thing. To feel
them engage with you, to be giving all their energy to you, as though
there is nothing else that matters in the world, is rarer still. To see
them do it for so long, so intensely?
Many viewers cried. Each one said the hours in line were worth it.
It was like looking in a kind of mirror, where they could feel their
own life for the first time.
Imagine: If Marina’s mind drifted, if she daydreamed, the person
across from her could immediately sense that she was somewhere
else. If she slowed her mind and body down too much, she might
have fallen asleep. If she allowed for normal bodily sensations—
hunger, discomfort, pain, the urge to go to the bathroom—it would
be impossible not to move or get up. If she began to think of how
much time was left in the day’s performance, time would slow to an
intolerable crawl. So with monklike discipline and warriorlike
strength she ignored these distractions to exist exclusively in the
present moment. She had to be where her feet were; she had to care
about the person across from her and the experience they were
sharing more than anything else in the world.
“People don’t understand that the hardest thing is actually doing
something that is close to nothing,” Abramović said about the
performance. “It demands all of you . . . there is no object to hide
behind. It’s just you.”
Being present demands all of us. It’s not nothing. It may be the
hardest thing in the world.
As we stand on the podium, about to give a speech, our mind is
focused not on our task but on what everyone will think of us. How
does that not affect our performance? As we struggle with a crisis,

our mind repeats on a loop just how unfair this is, how insane it is
that it keeps happening and how it can’t go on. Why are we draining
ourselves of essential emotional and mental energies right when we
need them most?
Even during a quiet evening at home, all we’re thinking about is
the list of improvements that need to be made. There may be a
beautiful sunset, but instead of taking it in, we’re taking a picture of
it.
We are not present . . . and so we miss out. On life. On being our
best. On seeing what’s there.
Many of the people in line to see Marina Abramović’s
performance accidentally illustrate this phenomenon. Rushing in as
the doors opened, they zoomed past equally impressive pieces from
her career so that they could be first for the “special” one. In line,
they fidgeted endlessly and chatted with each other, trying to kill
time as the hours ticked by. They napped, leaning up against one
another. They checked their phones . . . and then checked them
again. They planned what they would do when it was their turn and
speculated about what it would be like. Some of them worked in
secret on little stunts they hoped would bring them fifteen seconds of
fame.
How much ordinary wonderfulness they closed their minds to.
It makes you wonder: After they had their transcendent
experience with Marina—coming face-to-face with real presence—
when they left the museum and walked out into the busy New York
City street, did they breathe in anew the vibrant rhythm of the urban
jungle, or, more likely, did they immediately resume their busy lives,
full of distractions, anxiety, dreams, insecurities, and ego?
In short, did they do exactly what all of us do most of every single
day?
We do not live in this moment. We, in fact, try desperately to get
out of it—by thinking, doing, talking, worrying, remembering,
hoping, whatever. We pay thousands of dollars to have a device in
our pocket to ensure that we are never bored. We sign up for endless
activities and obligations, chase money and accomplishments, all
with the naïve belief that at the end of it will be happiness.

Tolstoy observed that love can’t exist off in the future. Love is
only real if it’s happening right now. If you think about it, that’s true
for basically everything we think, feel, or do. The best athletes, in the
biggest games, are completely there. They are within themselves,
within the now.
Remember, there’s no greatness in the future. Or clarity. Or
insight. Or happiness. Or peace. There is only this moment.
Not that we mean literally sixty seconds. The real present
moment is what we choose to exist in, instead of lingering on the past
or fretting about the future. It’s however long we can push away the
impressions of what’s happened before and what we worry or hope
might occur at some other time. Right now can be a few minutes or a
morning or a year—if you can stay in it that long.
As Laura Ingalls Wilder said, now is now. It can never be
anything else.
Seize it!
Who is so talented that they can afford to bring only part of
themselves to bear on a problem or opportunity? Whose
relationships are so strong that they can get away with not showing
up? Who is so certain that they’ll get another moment that they can
confidently skip over this one? The less energy we waste regretting
the past or worrying about the future, the more energy we will have
for what’s in front of us.
We want to learn to see the world like an artist: While other
people are oblivious to what surrounds them, the artist really sees.
Their mind, fully engaged, notices the way a bird flies or the way a
stranger holds their fork or a mother looks at her child. They have no
thoughts of the morrow. All they are thinking about is how to capture
and communicate this experience.
An artist is present. And from this stillness comes brilliance.
This moment we are experiencing right now is a gift (that’s why
we call it the present). Even if it is a stressful, trying experience—it
could be our last. So let’s develop the ability to be in it, to put
everything we have into appreciating the plentitude of the now.
Don’t reject a difficult or boring moment because it is not exactly
what you want. Don’t waste a beautiful moment because you are
insecure or shy. Make what you can of what you have been given.

Live what can be lived. That’s what excellence is. That’s what
presence makes possible.
In meditation, teachers instruct students to focus on their breath.
In and out. In and out. In sports, coaches speak about “the
process”—this play, this drill, this rep. Not just because this moment
is special, but because you can’t do your best if your mind is
elsewhere.
We would do well to follow this in our own lives. Jesus told his
disciples not to worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will take
care of itself. Another way of saying that is: You have plenty on your
plate right now. Focus on that, no matter how small or insignificant
it is. Do the very best you can right now.Don’t think about what
detractors may say. Don’t dwell or needlessly complicate. Be here. Be
all of you.
Be present.
And if you’ve had trouble with this in the past? That’s okay.
That’s the nice thing about the present. It keeps showing up to
give you a second chance.

LIMIT YOUR INPUTS

A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.
—HERBERT SIMON

A

s a general, Napoleon made it his habit to delay responding to
the mail. His secretary was instructed to wait three weeks before
opening any correspondence. When he finally did hear what was in a
letter, Napoleon loved to note how many supposedly “important”
issues had simply resolved themselves and no longer required a
reply.
While Napoleon was certainly an eccentric leader, he was never
negligent in his duties or out of touch with his government or his
soldiers. But in order to be active and aware of what actually
mattered, he had to be selective about who and what kind of
information got access to his brain.
In a similar vein, he told messengers never to wake him with
good news. Bad news, on the other hand—that is to say, an unfolding
crisis or an urgent development that negatively impacted his
campaign—was to be brought to him immediately. “Rouse me
instantly,” he said, “for then there is not a moment to be lost.”
These were both brilliant accommodations to the reality of life for
a busy person: There is way too much coming at us. In order to think
clearly, it is essential that each of us figures out how to filter out the
inconsequential from the essential. It’s not enough to be inclined
toward deep thought and sober analysis; a leader must create time
and space for it.

In the modern world, this is not easy. In the 1990s, political
scientists began to study what they called the “CNN Effect.”
Breathless, twenty-four-hour media coverage makes it considerably
harder for politicians and CEOs to be anything but reactive. There’s
too much information, every trivial detail is magnified under the
microscope, speculation is rampant—and the mind is overwhelmed.
The CNN Effect is now a problem for everyone, not just
presidents and generals. Each of us has access to more information
than we could ever reasonably use. We tell ourselves that it’s part of
our job, that we have to be “on top of things,” and so we give up
precious time to news, reports, meetings, and other forms of
feedback. Even if we’re not glued to a television, we’re still
surrounded by gossip and drama and other distractions.
We must stop this.
“If you wish to improve,” Epictetus once said, “be content to
appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.”
Napoleon was content with being behind on his mail, even if it
upset some people or if he missed out on some gossip, because it
meant that trivial problems had to resolve themselves without him.
We need to cultivate a similar attitude—give things a little space,
don’t consume news in real time, be a season or two behind on the
latest trend or cultural phenomenon, don’t let your inbox lord over
your life.
The important stuff will still be important by the time you get to
it. The unimportant will have made its insignificance obvious (or
simply disappeared). Then, with stillness rather than needless
urgency or exhaustion, you will be able to sit down and give what
deserves consideration your full attention.
There is ego in trying to stay up on everything, whether it’s an
acclaimed television show, the newest industry rumor, the smartest
hot take, or the hottest crisis in [the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the
climate, the World Bank, the NATO Summit, ad infinitum]. There is
ego in trying to appear the most informed person in the room, the
one with all the gossip, who knows every single thing that’s
happening in everyone’s life.
Not only does this cost us our peace of mind, but there’s a serious
opportunity cost too. If we were stiller, more confident, had the

longer view, what truly meaningful subject could we dedicate our
mental energy to?
In her diary in 1942, Dorothy Day, the Catholic nun and social
activist, admonished herself much the same. “Turn off your radio,”
she wrote, “put away your daily paper. Read one review of events and
spend time reading.” Books, spend time reading books—that’s what
she meant. Books full of wisdom.
Though this too can be overdone.
The verse from John Ferriar:
What wild desires, what restless torments seize
The hapless man, who feels the book-disease.
The point is, it’s very difficult to think or act clearly (to say
nothing of being happy) when we are drowning in information. It’s
why lawyers attempt to bury the other side in paper. It’s why
intelligence operatives flood the enemy with propaganda, so they’ll
lose the scent of the truth. It’s not a coincidence that the goal of these
tactics is casually referred to as analysis paralysis.
Yet we do this to ourselves!
A century and a half after Napoleon, another great general and,
later, head of state, Dwight D. Eisenhower, struggled to manage the
torrent of facts and fiction that was thrown at him. His solution was
strict adherence to the chain of command when it came to
information. No one was to hand him unopened mail, no one was to
just throw half-explored problems at him. Too much depended on
the stillness within that he needed to operate to allow such
haphazard information flow. One of his innovations was to organize
information and problems into what’s now called the “Eisenhower
Box,” a matrix that orders our priorities by their ratio of urgency and
importance.
Much that was happening in the world or on the job, Eisenhower
found, was urgent but not important. Meanwhile, most of what was
truly important was not remotely time-sensitive. Categorizing his
inputs helped him organize his staff around what was important
versus what seemed urgent, allowed them to be strategic rather than

reactive, a mile deep on what mattered rather than an inch on too
many things.
Indeed, the first thing great chiefs of staff do—whether it’s for a
general or a president or the CEO of a local bank—is limit the
amount of people who have access to the boss. They become
gatekeepers: no more drop-ins, tidbits, and stray reports. So the boss
can see the big picture. So the boss has time and room to think.
Because if the boss doesn’t? Well, then nobody can.
In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says, “Ask yourself at every
moment, ‘Is this necessary?’”
Knowing what not to think about. What to ignore and not to do.
It’s your first and most important job.
Thich Nhat Hanh:
Before we can make deep changes in our lives, we have to
look into our diet, our way of consuming. We have to live
in such a way that we stop consuming the things that
poison us and intoxicate us. Then we will have the strength
to allow the best in us to arise, and we will no longer be
victims of anger, of frustration.
It’s as true of food as it is of information.
There’s a great saying: Garbage in, garbage out. If you want good
output, you have to watch over the inputs.
This will take discipline. It will not be easy.
This means fewer alerts and notifications. It means blocking
incoming texts with the Do Not Disturb function and funneling
emails to subfolders. It means questioning that “open door” policy,
or even where you live. It means pushing away selfish people who
bring needless drama into our lives. It means studying the world
more philosophically—that is, with a long-term perspective—rather
than following events second by second.
The way you feel when you awake early in the morning and your
mind is fresh and as yet unsoiled by the noise of the outside world—
that’s space worth protecting. So too is the zone you lock into when
you’re really working well. Don’t let intrusions bounce you out of it.

Put up barriers. Put up the proper chuting to direct what’s urgent
and unimportant to the right people.
Walker Percy, one of the last great southern novelists, has a
powerful passage in Lancelot, based on Percy’s own struggle with
idleness and addiction to entertainment. In the book, the harried
narrator walks outside of his Mississippi mansion and, for the first
time in years, simply stops. He steps outside his bubble and
experiences the moment. “Can a man stand alone, naked, and at his
ease, wrist flexed at his side like Michelangelo’s David, without
assistance, without diversion . . . in silence?” he asks.
Yes. It was possible to stand. Nothing happened. I
listened. There was no sound: no boats on the river, no
trucks on the road, not even cicadas. What if I didn’t listen
to the news? I didn’t. Nothing happened. I realized I had
been afraid of the silence.
It is in this stillness that we can be present and finally see truth. It
is in this stillness that we can hear the voice inside us.
How different would the world look if people spent as much time
listening to their conscience as they did to chattering broadcasts? If
they could respond to the calls of their convictions as quickly as we
answer the dings and rings of technology in our pockets?
All this noise. All this information. All these inputs.
We are afraid of the silence. We are afraid of looking stupid. We
are afraid of missing out. We are afraid of being the bad guy who
says, “Nope, not interested.”
We’d rather make ourselves miserable than make ourselves a
priority, than be our best selves.
Than be still . . . and in charge of our own information diet.

EMPTY THE MIND

To become empty is to become one with the divine—
this is the Way.
—AWA KENZO

S

hawn Green began his third season with the Los Angeles Dodgers
in 2002 in the worst slump of his Major League Baseball career.
The media was out for blood, and so were the fans, who booed him at
the plate. Dodgers management began to doubt him too. The man
was making $14 million a year and he could not hit.
After weeks of intense hitting famine, would he be benched?
Traded? Sent down to the minors?
All this was racing through Green’s mind, as it would race
through the mind of anyone struggling at work. That little voice:
What’s wrong with you? Why can’t you get this right? Did you lose
your touch?
Hitting a baseball is already a nearly inconceivable feat. It
requires the batter to see, process, decide, swing at, and connect with
a tiny ball traveling at speeds north of 90 miles per hour from an
elevated position sixty feet away. Four hundred milliseconds. That’s
how long it takes for the ball to travel from the mound to the batter.
To be able to swing and hit it literally defies physics—it’s the single
hardest act in all of sports.
The anxiety and doubts in a slump make it even harder. Yogi
Berra’s warning: “It’s impossible to hit and think at the same time.”

For Green, the ball began to look smaller and smaller the longer
he went without a hit. But it was Buddhism, which he had long
practiced, that Shawn leaned on to prevent this vicious cycle from
destroying his career. Instead of giving in to those churning thoughts
—instead of trying harder and harder—he tried to clear his mind
entirely. Instead of fighting the slump, he was going to try not to
think about it at all.
It seems crazy, but it isn’t. “Man is a thinking reed,” D. T. Suzuki,
one of the early popularizers of Buddhism in the West, once said,
“but his great works are done when he is not calculating and
thinking. ‘Childlikeness’ has to be restored with long years of training
in the art of self-forgetfulness. When this is attained, man thinks yet
he does not think.”
The way out of the slump wasn’t to consult experts or redesign his
swing. Shawn Green knew he had to get rid of the toxic thinking that
had knocked him off his game in the first place—the thinking about
his big contract, the expectations for how he wanted the season to go,
the stress at home, or the critics in the media.
He had to push all that out of his mind. He had to let his training
take over.
On May 23, 2002, Green was struggling to do exactly that. It was
the rubber match in a series against the Brewers. The Dodgers had
eked out a 1–0 victory the night before, and lost the night before that.
Green’s own hitting was sporadic and discouraging. So when he got
to the ballpark that morning, he worked to give himself a fresh start.
First in the batting cage, and then at the batting tee, he slowly,
patiently, quietly cleared his mind. With each swing, he tried to focus
on the mechanics, the placement of his feet, really planting himself
where his feet were—not thinking of the past, not worrying about
what was coming in the future, not thinking about the fans or how he
wanted to hit the ball. Really, he wasn’t thinking at all. Instead, he
repeated an old Zen proverb to himself: Chop wood, carry water.
Chop wood, carry water. Chop wood, carry water.
Don’t overanalyze. Do the work.
Don’t think. Hit.
In his first at bat on that day, Green took two strikes in the first
two pitches. His mind burbled a bit—Is the slump going to keep

going, is this ever going to end, why can’t I get this right?—but he
let those wild horses run right on by, waiting for the dust they kicked
up to settle. He breathed in, emptied his mind again—as empty as
the seats in the stadium during his pregame ritual.
Then he got back to work. On the third pitch—CRACK! A solid
double down the right-field line.
In the second inning, Green got an inside fastball. He planted his
front foot and focused only on that, on the feeling of being nailed to
the ground. He watched the pitch, and swung. The ball was soon
going back out the other direction, high up over the right-field wall.
Three runs came in along with it. In the fourth inning, he hit another
homer up in the walkway over right-center field. In the fifth inning,
he hit a home run deep into left field. Opposite field, a sign that a
hitter is really starting to dial in. In the eighth inning, he hit a long
single.
The slump was no more.
Five for five in his at bats, and the manager wanted to send him
home for the day. Green asked for another at bat.
Now his mind was tempted to race in a different direction, his
brain filled with congratulations instead of doubts. You’re killing it.
How exciting is this? Are you going to get another hit? You could set
a record!
Just like the overactive voice in a slump, the voice in a streak is an
equally deleterious racing mental loop. Both get in the way. Both
make a hard thing harder.
As Shawn Green stepped into the batter’s box for the sixth and
final time, he said to himself, “There’s no sense in thinking now.” He
cleared his mind, and enjoyed himself like a kid at a Little League
game.
No pressure. Just presence. Just happy to be there.
On the third pitch, he got a dipping cutter that sank low and
inside, below knee level. For lefties, like Green, when they are in a
slump, that area of the hitting zone is like a black hole. When they’re
locked in, it’s the wheelhouse. Green connected, with a swing that
even one of the coaches said looked like it was happening in slow
motion. Every part of the batter was behind the bat, mentally and
physically—and the ball was launched deep, deep into right-center

field. He hit it a mile. It slammed high off the back wall of the
enclosed stadium and bounced back onto the field.
As Green’s teammates went nuts in the dugout, he kept his head
down and rounded the bases with the same calm, deliberate trot as in
his previous three home runs. You couldn’t tell from the lack of
celebrating, but he was in that moment only the fourteenth player in
history ever to hit four home runs in a single game. Six for six, with
nineteen total bases and seven runs batted in, perhaps the single
greatest one-game performance in baseball. The entire crowd of
26,728 people—at an away game—rose for a standing ovation. But
Green was already clearing that all away, and coming back to his
routine. He took off his batting gloves and swept the experience from
his mind, keeping it empty to use in the next game.*
Shawn Green is hardly the first Buddhist baseball player.
Sadaharu Oh, the greatest home run hitter in the history of baseball,
was one too. The goal of Zen, his master taught him, was to “achieve
a void . . . noiseless, colorless, heatless void”—to get to that state of
emptiness, whether it was on the mound or in the batter’s box or at
practice.
Before that, Zhuang Zhou, the Chinese philosopher, said, “Tao is
in the emptiness. Emptiness is the fast of the mind.” Marcus Aurelius
once wrote about “cutting free of impressions that cling to the mind,
free of the future and the past,” to become the “sphere rejoicing in its
perfect stillness.” But if you saw those words in the first paragraph of
the write-up for the Dodgers-Brewers game in the Los Angeles Times
the next day, they would have made perfect sense. Epictetus,
Marcus’s philosophical predecessor, was in fact speaking about
sports when he said, “If we’re anxious or nervous when we make the
catch or throw, what will become of the game, and how can one
maintain one’s composure; how can one see what is coming next?”
As is true in athletics, so too in life.
Yes, thinking is essential. Expert knowledge is undoubtedly key to
the success of any leader or athlete or artist. The problem is that,
unthinkingly, we think too much. The “wild and whirling words” of
our subconscious get going and suddenly there’s no room for our
training (or anything else). We’re overloaded, overwhelmed, and
distracted . . . by our own mind!

But if we can clear space, if we can consciously empty our mind,
as Green did, insights and breakthroughs happen. The perfect swing
connects perfectly with the ball.
There is a beautiful paradox to this idea of void.
The Daodejing points out that when clay is formed around
emptiness, it becomes a pitcher that can hold water. Water from the
pitcher is poured into a cup, which is itself formed around emptiness.
The room this all happens in is itself four walls formed around
emptiness.
Do you see? By relying on what’s not there, we actually have
something worth using. During the recording of her album Interiors,
the musician Rosanne Cash posted a simple sign over the doorway of
the studio. “Abandon Thought, All Ye Who Enter Here.” Not because
she wanted a bunch of unthinking idiots working with her, but
because she wanted everyone involved—included herself—to go
deeper than whatever was on the surface of their minds. She wanted
them to be present, connected to the music, and not lost in their
heads.
Imagine if Kennedy had spent the Cuban Missile Crisis obsessing
over the Bay of Pigs. Imagine if Shawn Green had tried frantically to
re-create his swing because it wasn’t working, or if he had faced
those pitchers with a racing mind, filled with insecurities and
desperation. We’ve all experienced that—Don’t mess up. Don’t mess
up. Don’t forget, we say to ourselves—and what happens? We do
exactly what we were trying not to do!
Whatever you face, whatever you’re doing will require, first and
foremost, that you don’t defeat yourself. That you don’t make it
harder by overthinking, by needless doubts, or by second-guessing.
That space between your ears—that’s yours. You don’t just have
to control what gets in, you also have to control what goes on in
there. You have to protect it from yourself, from your own thoughts.
Not with sheer force, but rather with a kind of gentle, persistent
sweeping. Be the librarian who says “Shhh!” to the rowdy kids, or
tells the jerk on his phone to please take it outside.
Because the mind is an important and sacred place.
Keep it clean and clear.

SLOW DOWN, THINK DEEPLY

With my sighted eye I see what’s before me, and with
my unsighted eye I see what’s hidden.
—ALICE WALKER

I

n the intro sequence of the beloved children’s show Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood, the first interior shot does not show the host.
Instead, in the beat before Fred Rogers appears on the screen singing
his cheerful song about being a good neighbor, viewers see a traffic
light, blinking yellow.
For more than thirty years and for nearly a thousand episodes,
this subtle piece of symbolism opened the show. If as a hint, it went
over the heads of most people watching, viewers were still primed to
get the message. Because whether Fred Rogers was speaking on
camera, playing in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe with King
Friday the Puppet, or singing one of his trademark songs, just about
every frame of the show seemed to say: Slow down. Be considerate.
Be aware.
As a child at Latrobe Elementary School in Pennsylvania, Fred
Rogers had been a victim of vicious bullying. Kids picked on him
because of his weight and because he was sensitive about it. It was a
horrible experience, but this pain spurred his groundbreaking work
in public television. “I began a lifelong search for what is essential,”
he said about his childhood, “what it is about my neighbor that
doesn’t meet the eye.” He even framed a print of that idea on the wall

of his production studio in Pittsburgh, a snippet from one of his
favorite quotes: L’essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.
What’s essential is invisible to the eye.
That is: Appearances are misleading. First impressions are too.
We are disturbed and deceived by what’s on the surface, by what
others see. Then we make bad decisions, miss opportunities, or feel
scared or upset. Particularly when we don’t slow down and take the
time to really look.
Think about Khrushchev on the other side of the Cuban Missile
Crisis. What provoked his incredible overreach? A poor reading of
his opponent’s mettle. A rush to action. Shoddy thinking about how
his own actions would be interpreted on the world stage. It was a
nearly fatal miscalculation, as most rush jobs are.
Epictetus talked about how the job of a philosopher is to take our
impressions—what we see, hear, and think—and put them to the test.
He said we needed to hold up our thoughts and examine them, to
make sure we weren’t being led astray by appearances or missing
what couldn’t be seen by the naked eye.
Indeed, it is in Stoicism and Buddhism and countless other
schools that we find the same analogy: The world is like muddy
water. To see through it, we have to let things settle. We can’t be
disturbed by initial appearances, and if we are patient and still, the
truth will be revealed to us.
That’s what Mr. Rogers taught children to do—starting a crucial
habit as early as possible in their lives. In countless episodes, Rogers
would take a topic—whether it was self-worth or how crayons were
made, divorce or having fun—and walk his young viewers through
what was really happening and what it meant. He seemed to
naturally know how a kid’s mind would process information, and
he’d help them clear up understandable confusion or fears. He
taught empathy and critical reasoning skills. He reassured his
viewers that they could figure just about anything out if they took the
time to work through it—with him, together.
It’s a message he shared with adults too. “Just think,” Rogers
once wrote to a struggling friend. “Just be quiet and think. It’ll make
all the difference in the world.”

There is, on the surface, a contradiction here. On the one hand,
the Buddhists say we must empty our minds to be fully present. We’ll
never get anything done if we are paralyzed by overthinking. On the
other hand, we must look and think and study deeply if we are ever
to truly know (and if we are to avoid falling into the destructive
patterns that harm so many people).
In fact, this is not a contradiction at all. It’s just life.
We have to get better at thinking, deliberately and intentionally,
about the big questions. On the complicated things. On
understanding what’s really going on with a person, or a situation, or
with life itself.
We have to do the kind of thinking that 99 percent of the
population is just not doing, and we have to stop doing the
destructive thinking that they spend 99 percent of their time doing.
The eighteenth-century Zen master Hakuin was highly critical of
teachers who believed that enlightenment was simply a matter of
thinking nothing. Instead, he wanted his students to think really,
really hard. This is why he assigned them perplexing kōans like
“What is the sound of one hand clapping?” and “What did your face
look like before you were born?” and “Does the dog have the Buddha
nature?”
These questions defy easy answers, and that’s the point. By taking
the time to meditate on them deeply, in some cases for days and
weeks or even years, students put their mind in such a clarified state
that deeper truths emerge, and enlightenment commences (and even
if they don’t get all the way there, they are stronger for having tried).
“Suddenly,” Hakuin promised his students, “unexpectedly your
teeth sink in. Your body will pour with cold sweat. At the instant, it
will all become clear.” The word for this was satori—an illuminating
insight when the inscrutable is revealed, when an essential truth
becomes obvious and inescapable.
Couldn’t we all use a bit more of that?
Well, no one gets to satori going a million miles a minute. No one
gets there by focusing on what’s obvious, or by sticking with the first
thought that pops into their head. To see what matters, you really
have to look. To understand it, you have to really think. It takes real
work to grasp what is invisible to just about everyone else.

This will not only be advantageous to your career and your
business, but it will also help you find peace and comfort.
There is another great insight from Fred Rogers, which now goes
viral each time there is another unspeakable tragedy. “Always look
for the helpers,” he explained to his viewers who were scared or
disillusioned by the news. “There’s always someone who is trying to
help. . . . The world is full of doctors and nurses, police and firemen,
volunteers, neighbors and friends who are ready to jump in to help
when things go wrong.”
Make no mistake—this was not some glib reassurance. Rogers,
building on advice from his own mother when he was a child, had
managed to find comfort and goodness inside an event that would
provoke only pain and anger and fear in other people. And he figured
out how to communicate it in a way that continues to make the world
a better place long after his death.
So much of the distress we feel comes from reacting instinctually
instead of acting with conscientious deliberation. So much of what
we get wrong comes from the same place. We’re reacting to shadows.
We’re taking as certainties impressions we have yet to test. We’re not
stopping to put on our glasses and really look.
Your job, after you have emptied your mind, is to slow down and
think. To really think, on a regular basis.
. . . Think about what’s important to you.
. . . Think about what’s actually going on.
. . . Think about what might be hidden from view.
. . . Think about what the rest of the chessboard looks like.
. . . Think about what the meaning of life really is.
The choreographer Twyla Tharp provides an exercise for us to
follow:
Sit alone in a room and let your thoughts go wherever they
will. Do this for one minute. . . . Work up to ten minutes a
day of this mindless mental wandering. Then start paying
attention to your thoughts to see if a word or goal

materializes. If it doesn’t, extend the exercise to eleven
minutes, then twelve, then thirteen . . . until you find the
length of time you need to ensure that something
interesting will come to mind. The Gaelic phrase for this
state of mind is “quietness without loneliness.”
If you invest the time and mental energy, you’ll not only find
what’s interesting (or your next creative project), you’ll find truth.
You’ll find what other people have missed. You’ll find solutions to the
problems we face—whether it’s insight to the logic of the Soviets and
their missiles in Cuba, or how to move your business forward, or how
to make sense of senseless violence.
These are answers that must be fished from the depths. And what
is fishing but slowing down? Being both relaxed and highly attuned
to your environment? And ultimately, catching hold of what lurks
below the surface and reeling it in?

START JOURNALING

Keep a notebook. Travel with it, eat with it, sleep with
it. Slap into it every stray thought that flutters up into
your brain.
—JACK LONDON

F

or her thirteenth birthday, a precocious German refugee named
Anne Frank was given a small red-and-white “autograph book”
by her parents. Although the pages were designed to collect the
signatures and memories of friends, she knew from the moment she
first saw it in a store window that she would use it as a journal. As
Anne wrote in her first entry on June 12, 1942, “I hope I will be able
to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in
anyone, and I hope you’ll be a great source of comfort and support.”
No one could have anticipated just how much comfort and
support she’d need. Twenty-four days after that first entry, Anne and
her Jewish family were forced into hiding, in the cramped attic annex
over her father’s warehouse in Amsterdam. It’s where they would
spend the next two years, hoping the Nazis would not discover them.
Anne Frank had wanted a diary for understandable reasons. She
was a teenager. She had been lonely, scared, and bored before, but
now she was cooped up in a set of cramped, suffocating rooms with
six other people. It was all so overwhelming, all so unfair and
unfamiliar. She needed somewhere to put those feelings.
According to her father, Otto, Anne didn’t write every day, but
she always wrote when she was upset or dealing with a problem. She

also wrote when she was confused, when she was curious. She wrote
in that journal as a form of therapy, so as not to unload her troubled
thoughts on the family and compatriots with whom she shared such
unenviable conditions. One of her best and most insightful lines
must have come on a particularly difficult day. “Paper,” she said,
“has more patience than people.”
Anne used her journal to reflect. “How noble and good everyone
could be,” she wrote, “if at the end of the day they were to review
their own behavior and weigh up the rights and wrongs. They would
automatically try to do better at the start of each new day, and after a
while, would certainly accomplish a great deal.” She observed that
writing allowed her to watch herself as if she were a stranger. At a
time when hormones usually make teenagers more selfish, she
regularly reviewed her writings to challenge and improve her own
thinking. Even with death lurking outside the doors, she worked to
make herself a better person.
The list of people, ancient and modern, who practiced the art of
journaling is almost comically long and fascinatingly diverse. Among
them: Oscar Wilde, Susan Sontag, Marcus Aurelius, Queen Victoria,
John Quincy Adams, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Virginia Woolf, Joan
Didion, Shawn Green, Mary Chesnut, Brian Koppelman, Anaïs Nin,
Franz Kafka, Martina Navratilova, and Ben Franklin.
All journalers.
Some did it in the morning. Some did it sporadically. Some, like
Leonardo da Vinci, kept their notebooks on their person at all times.
John F. Kennedy kept a diary during his travels before World War II,
and then as president was more of a notetaker and a doodler (which
is shown in studies to improve memory) on White House stationery
both to clarify his thinking and to keep a record of it.
Obviously this is an intimidating list of individuals. But Anne
Frank was thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen years old. If she can do it,
what excuse do we have?
Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, seems to have done his writing and
reflection in the evenings, much along the lines of Anne Frank’s
practice. When darkness had fallen and his wife had gone to sleep, he
explained to a friend, “I examine my entire day and go back over
what I’ve done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing

by.” Then he would go to bed, finding that “the sleep which follows
this self-examination” was particularly sweet. Anyone who reads him
today can feel him reaching for stillness in these nightly writings.
Michel Foucault talked of the ancient genre of hupomnemata
(notes to oneself). He called the journal a “weapon for spiritual
combat,” a way to practice philosophy and purge the mind of
agitation and foolishness and to overcome difficulty. To silence the
barking dogs in your head. To prepare for the day ahead. To reflect
on the day that has passed. Take note of insights you’ve heard. Take
the time to feel wisdom flow through your fingertips and onto the
page.
This is what the best journals look like. They aren’t for the reader.
They are for the writer. To slow the mind down. To wage peace with
oneself.
Journaling is a way to ask tough questions: Where am I standing
in my own way? What’s the smallest step I can take toward a big
thing today? Why am I so worked up about this? What blessings can
I count right now? Why do I care so much about impressing people?
What is the harder choice I’m avoiding? Do I rule my fears, or do
they rule me? How will today’s difficulties reveal my character?*
While there are plenty of people who will anecdotally swear to the
benefits of journaling, the research is compelling too. According to
one study, journaling helps improve well-being after traumatic and
stressful events. Similarly, a University of Arizona study showed that
people were able to better recover from divorce and move forward if
they journaled on the experience. Keeping a journal is a common
recommendation from psychologists as well, because it helps
patients stop obsessing and allows them to make sense of the many
inputs—emotional, external, psychological—that would otherwise
overwhelm them.
That’s really the idea. Instead of carrying that baggage around in
our heads or hearts, we put it down on paper. Instead of letting
racing thoughts run unchecked or leaving half-baked assumptions
unquestioned, we force ourselves to write and examine them. Putting
your own thinking down on paper lets you see it from a distance. It
gives you objectivity that is so often missing when anxiety and fears
and frustrations flood your mind.

What’s the best way to start journaling? Is there an ideal time of
day? How long should it take?
Who cares?
How you journal is much less important than why you are doing
it: To get something off your chest. To have quiet time with your
thoughts. To clarify those thoughts. To separate the harmful from the
insightful.
There’s no right way or wrong way. The point is just to do it.
If you’ve started before and stopped, start again. Getting out of
the rhythm happens. The key is to carve out the space again, today.
The French painter Eugène Delacroix—who called Stoicism his
consoling religion—struggled as we struggle:
I am taking up my Journal again after a long break. I think
it may be a way of calming this nervous excitement that
has been worrying me for so long.
Yes!
That is what journaling is about. It’s spiritual windshield wipers,
as the writer Julia Cameron once put it. It’s a few minutes of
reflection that both demands and creates stillness. It’s a break from
the world. A framework for the day ahead. A coping mechanism for
troubles of the hours just past. A revving up of your creative juices,
for relaxing and clearing.
Once, twice, three times a day. Whatever. Find what works for
you.
Just know that it may turn out to be the most important thing you
do all day.

CULTIVATE SILENCE

All profound things, and emotions of things are
preceded and attended by Silence. . . . Silence is the
general consecration of the universe.
—HERMAN MELVILLE

T

he fascination with silence began early in life for the composer
John Cage. In 1928, in a speech contest for Los Angeles High
School, he tried to persuade his fellow students and the judges that
America should institute a national day of quiet. By observing
silence, he told the audience, they would finally be able to “hear what
other people think.”
It was the beginning of Cage’s lifelong exploration and
experimentation with what it means to be quiet and the
opportunities for listening that this disciplined silence creates.
Cage wandered after high school. He toured Europe. He studied
painting. He taught music. He composed classical music. He was an
avid observer. Born in 1915 in California, he was just old enough to
remember what premechanized life was like, and as the century
became modern—and technology remade every industry and
occupation—he began to notice just how loud everything had
become.
“Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise,” he would say.
“When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it
fascinating.”

To Cage, silence was not necessarily the absence of all sound. He
loved the sound of a truck at 50 miles an hour. Static on the radio.
The hum of an amplifier. The sound of water on water. Most of all, he
appreciated the sounds that were missed or overwhelmed by our
noisy lives.
In 1951, he visited an anechoic chamber, the most advanced
soundproof room in the world at the time. Even there, with his highly
sensitive musician’s ear, he heard sounds. Two sounds, one high and
one low. Speaking with the engineer afterward, he was amazed to
discover that the source of those sounds was his own nervous system
and the pumping of his blood.
How many of us have ever come close to this kind of quiet?
Reducing the noise and chatter around you to the degree that you
can literally hear your own life? Can you imagine? What you could do
with that much silence!
It was a reaction against unnecessary noise that inspired Cage’s
most famous creation, 4′33″ , which was originally conceived with
the title Silent Prayer. Cage wanted to create a song identical to the
popular music of the day—it’d be the same length, it’d be performed
live and played on the radio like every other song. The only
difference was that 4′33″ would be a “piece of uninterrupted
silence.”
Some people saw this as an absurd joke, a Duchampian send-up
of what constitutes “music.” In one sense, it was. (Cage thought it
would be funny to sell the “song” to Muzak Co. to be played in
elevators.) But it was also inspired by his lifelong study of Zen
philosophy, a philosophy that finds fullness in emptiness. The
performance instructions for the song are themselves a beautiful
contradiction: “In a situation provided with maximum amplification,
perform a disciplined action.”
In fact, 4′33″ was never about achieving perfect silence—it’s
about what happens when you stop contributing to the noise. The
song was first performed at Woodstock, New York, by the pianist
David Tudor.* “There’s no such thing as silence,” Cage said of that
first performance. “What they thought was silence, because they
didn’t know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds. You could
hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the

second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third the
people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked
or walked out.”
We were given two ears and only one mouth for a reason, the
philosopher Zeno observed. What you’ll notice when you stop to
listen can make all the difference in the world.
Too much of our lives is defined by noise. Headphones go in
(noise-canceling headphones so that we can better hear . . . noise).
Screens on. Phones ringing. The quiet metal womb of a jumbo jet,
traveling at 600 miles per hour, is filled with nothing but people
trying to avoid silence. They’d rather watch the same bad movies
again and again, or listen to some inane interview with an annoying
celebrity, than stop and absorb what’s happening around them.
They’d rather close their mind than sit there and have to use it.
“Thought will not work except in silence,” Thomas Carlyle said. If
we want to think better, we need to seize these moments of quiet. If
we want more revelations—more insights or breakthroughs or new,
big ideas—we have to create more room for them. We have to step
away from the comfort of noisy distractions and stimulations. We
have to start listening.
In downtown Helsinki, there is a small building called the
Kamppi Chapel. It’s not a place of worship, strictly speaking, but it’s
as quiet as any cathedral. Quieter, in fact, because there are no
echoes. No organs. No enormous creaking doors. It is, in fact, a
Church of Silence. It’s open to anyone and everyone who is interested
in a moment of quiet spirituality in a busy city.
You walk in and there is just silence.
Glorious, sacred silence. The kind of silence that lets you really
start hearing.
Randall Stutman, who for decades has been the behind-thescenes advisor for many of the biggest CEOs and leaders on Wall
Street, once studied how several hundred senior executives of major
corporations recharged in their downtime. The answers were things
like sailing, long-distance cycling, listening quietly to classical music,
scuba diving, riding motorcycles, and fly-fishing. All these activities,
he noticed, had one thing in common: an absence of voices.

These were people with busy, collaborative professions. People
who made countless high-stakes decisions in the course of a day. But
a couple hours without chatter, without other people in their ear,
where they could simply think (or not think), they could recharge
and find peace. They could be still—even if they were moving. They
could finally hear, even if over the sounds of a roaring river or the
music of Vivaldi.
Each of us needs to cultivate those moments in our lives. Where
we limit our inputs and turn down the volume so that we can access a
deeper awareness of what’s going on around us. In shutting up—even
if only for a short period—we can finally hear what the world has
been trying to tell us. Or what we’ve been trying to tell ourselves.
That quiet is so rare is a sign of its value. Seize it.
We can’t be afraid of silence, as it has much to teach us. Seek it.
The ticking of the hands of your watch is telling you how time is
passing away, never to return. Listen to it.

SEEK WISDOM

Imperturbable wisdom is worth everything.
—DEMOCRITUS

I

n Greece in 426 BC, the priestess of Delphi answered a question
posed to her by a citizen of Athens: Was there anyone wiser than
Socrates?
Her answer: No.
This idea that Socrates could be the wisest of them all was a
surprise, to Socrates especially.
Unlike traditionally wise people who knew many things, and
unlike pretentious people who claimed to know many things,
Socrates was intellectually humble. In fact, he spent most of his life
sincerely proclaiming his lack of wisdom.
Yet this was the secret to his brilliance, the reason he has stood
apart for centuries as a model of wisdom. Six hundred years after
Socrates’s death, Diogenes Laërtius would write that what made
Socrates so wise was that “he knew nothing except just the fact of his
ignorance.” Better still, he was aware of what he did not know and
was always willing to be proven wrong.
Indeed, the core of what we now call the Socratic method comes
from Socrates’s real and often annoying habit of going around asking
questions. He was constantly probing other people’s views. Why do
you think that? How do you know? What evidence do you have? But
what about this or that?

This open-minded search for truth, for wisdom, was what made
Socrates the most brilliant and challenging man in Athens—so much
so that they later killed him for it.
All philosophical schools preach the need for wisdom. The
Hebrew word for wisdom is
(chokmâh); the corresponding
term in Islam is ḥikma, and both cultures believe that God was an
endless source of it. The Greek word for wisdom was sophia, which
in Latin became sapientia (and why man is called Homo sapiens).
Both the Epicureans and the Stoics held sophia up as a core tenet. In
their view, wisdom was gained through experience and study. Jesus
advised his followers to be as wise as snakes and as innocent as
doves. Proverbs 4:7 holds acquiring wisdom to be the most
important thing people can do.
The Buddhists refer to wisdom as prajñā, and took wisdom to
mean the understanding of the true nature of reality. Confucius and
his followers spoke constantly of the cultivation of wisdom, saying
that it is achieved in the same way that a craftsman develops skill: by
putting in the time. Xunzi was more explicit: “Learning must never
cease. . . . The noble person who studies widely and examines himself
each day will become clear in his knowing and faultless in his
conduct.”
Each school has its own take on wisdom, but the same themes
appear in all of them: The need to ask questions. The need to study
and reflect. The importance of intellectual humility. The power of
experiences—most of all failure and mistakes—to open our eyes to
truth and understanding. In this way, wisdom is a sense of the big
picture, the accumulation of experience and the ability to rise above
the biases, the traps that catch lazier thinkers.
The fact that you are sitting here reading a book is a wonderful
step on the journey to wisdom. But don’t stop here—this book is only
an introduction to classical thinking and history. Tolstoy expressed
his exasperation at people who didn’t read deeply and regularly. “I
cannot understand,” he said, “how some people can live without
communicating with the wisest people who ever lived on earth.”
There’s another line, now cliché, that is even more cutting: People
who don’t read have no advantage over those who cannot read.

There’s little advantage to reading with arrogance or to confirm
preexisting opinions either. Hitler, spent his short prison sentence
after World War I reading the classics of history. Except instead of
learning anything, he found in those thousands of pages only that, as
he said, “I recognized the correctness of my views.”
That’s not wisdom. Or even stupidity. That’s insanity.
We must also seek mentors and teachers who can guide us in our
journey. Stoicism, for instance, was founded when Zeno, then a
successful merchant, first heard someone reading the teachings of
Socrates out loud in a bookstore. But that wasn’t enough. What he
did next was what put him on the path to wisdom, for he walked up
to the person reading and said, “Where can I find a man like that?”
In Buddhism, there is the idea of pabbajja, which means “to go
forth” and marks the serious beginning of one’s studies. That’s what
Zeno was doing. Answering the call and going forth.
Zeno’s teacher was a philosopher named Crates, and Crates not
only gave him many things to read, but like all great mentors helped
him address personal issues. It was with Crates’s help that Zeno
overcame his crippling focus on what other people thought of him, in
one case by dumping soup on Zeno and pointing out how little
anyone cared or even noticed.
Buddha’s first teacher was an ascetic named Alara Kalama, who
taught him the basics of meditation. When he learned everything he
could from Kalama, he moved on to Uddaka Ramaputta, who was
also a good teacher. It was during Ramaputta’s time that Buddha
started to realize the limitations of the existing schools and consider
striking out on his own.
If Zeno and Buddha needed teachers to advance, then we will
definitely need help. And the ability to admit that is evidence of not a
small bit of wisdom!
Find people you admire and ask how they got where they are.
Seek book recommendations. Isn’t that what Socrates would do? Add
experience and experimentation on top of this. Put yourself in tough
situations. Accept challenges. Familiarize yourself with the
unfamiliar. That’s how you widen your perspective and your
understanding. The wise are still because they have seen it all. They

know what to expect because they’ve been through so much. They’ve
made mistakes and learned from them. And so must you.
Wrestle with big questions. Wrestle with big ideas. Treat your
brain like the muscle that it is. Get stronger through resistance and
exposure and training.
Do not mistake the pursuit of wisdom for an endless parade of
sunshine and kittens. Wisdom does not immediately produce
stillness or clarity. Quite the contrary. It might even make things less
clear—make them darker before the dawn.
Remember, Socrates looked honestly at what he didn’t know.
That’s hard. It’s painful to have our illusions punctured. It’s
humbling to learn that we are not as smart as we thought we were.
It’s also inevitable that the diligent student will uncover
disconcerting or challenging ideas—about the world and about
themselves. This will be unsettling. How could it not be?
But that’s okay.
It’s better than crashing through life (and into each other) like
blind moles, to borrow Khrushchev’s analogy.
We want to sit with doubt. We want to savor it. We want to follow
it where it leads.
Because on the other side is truth.

FIND CONFIDENCE, AVOID EGO

Avoid having your ego so close to your position that
when your position falls, your ego goes with it.
—COLIN POWELL

I

n 1000 BC in the Valley of Elah, the people of Israel and Philistia
were locked in terrible war. No end was in sight until the towering
Goliath offered a bold challenge to end the stalemate between the
armies. “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let
us fight each other,” he shouted.
For forty days, not a single soldier stepped forward, not even the
king of Israel, Saul. If Goliath was driven by ego and hubris, the
Israelites were paralyzed by fear and doubt.
Then came young David, a visiting shepherd with three brothers
in the army. David heard Goliath’s challenge, and unlike the entire
army, cowering in fear, he was confident that he could fight Goliath
and win. Was he crazy? How could he possibly think he could beat
someone so big?
“When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the
flock,” David said to his brothers, “I went after it, struck it, and
rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it
by its hair, struck it, and killed it. Your servant has killed both the
lion and the bear; this Philistine will be like one of them.”
David’s confidence arose from experience, not ego. He had been
through worse and done it with his bare hands.

David knew his strengths, but he also knew his weaknesses. “I
cannot go in these,” he said after trying on a soldier’s armor,
“because I am not used to them.” He was ready to proceed with what
we could call true self-awareness (and of course, his faith).
How did Goliath respond to his tiny challenger? Like your typical
bully: He laughed. “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?”
Goliath shouted. “Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the
birds and the wild animals!”
This arrogance would be short-lived.
David came at Goliath at a full sprint, a sling in one hand and a
few stones from the river in the other. In those few quick seconds,
Goliath must have seen the confidence in David’s eyes and been
afraid for the first time—and before he could do anything, he was
dead. Felled by the stone flung expertly from David’s sling. His head
cut off by his own sword.
The story of these two combatants may be true. It may be a fable.
But it remains one of the best stories we have about the perils of ego,
the importance of humility, and the necessity of confidence.
There is perhaps no one less at peace than the egomaniac, their
mind a swirling miasma of their own grandiosity and insecurity.
They constantly bite off more than they can chew. They pick fights
everywhere they go. They create enemies. They are incapable of
learning from their mistakes (because they don’t believe they make
any). Everything with them is complicated, everything is about them.
Life is lonely and painful for the man or woman driven by ego.
Donald Trump in the White House at night, his wife and son far
away, in his bathrobe, ranting about the news. Alexander the Great,
drunk again, fighting and killing his best friend over a stupid
argument, thinking of nothing but the next conquest. Howard
Hughes, trapped in his mansion, manically excited about some crazy
project (which he will inevitably sabotage).
Successful, yes, but would you want to trade places with them?
This toxic form of ego has a less-assuming evil twin—often called
“imposter syndrome.”
It’s a nagging, endless anxiety that you’re not qualified for what
you’re doing—and you’re about to be found out for it. Shakespeare’s
image for this feeling was of a thief wearing a stolen robe he knows is

too big. The writer Franz Kafka, the son of an overbearing and
disapproving father, likened imposter syndrome to the feeling of a
bank clerk who is cooking the books. Frantically trying to keep it all
going. Terrified of being discovered.
Of course, this insecurity exists almost entirely in our heads.
People aren’t thinking about you. They have their own problems to
worry about!
What is better than these two extremes—ego and imposter
syndrome—but simple confidence? Earned. Rational. Objective. Still.
Ulysses S. Grant had an egotistical, self-promoting father, who
was always caught up in some scheme or scandal. Grant knew that
wasn’t who he wanted to be. In response, he developed a cool and
calm self-confidence that was much closer to his mother’s quiet but
strong personality. It was the source of his greatness.
Before the Civil War, Grant experienced a long chain of setbacks
and financial difficulties. He washed up in St. Louis, selling firewood
for a living—a hard fall for a graduate of West Point. An army buddy
found him and was aghast. “Great God, Grant, what are you doing?”
he asked. Grant’s answer was simple: “I am solving the problem of
poverty.”
That’s the answer of a confident person, a person at peace even in
difficulty. Grant wouldn’t have chosen this situation, but he wasn’t
going to let it affect his sense of self. Besides, he was too busy trying
to fix it where he could. Why hate himself for working for a living?
What was shameful about that?
Observers often commented on Grant’s unshakable confidence in
battle. When other generals were convinced that defeat was
imminent, Grant never was. He knew he just needed to stay the
course. He also knew that losing hope—or his cool—was unlikely to
help anything.
With similar equanimity, he was equally unchanged by his
success and power in later years, not just leading a powerful army
but spending eight years as a world leader. (Charles Dana observed
of Grant that he was an “unpretending hero, whom no ill omens
could deject and no triumph unduly exalt.”) After his presidency,
Grant visited the old cabin where he and his wife had lived in those
hard days. One of his aides pointed out what an incredible rags-to-

riches story his life was—almost like the plot of an epic poem—to go
from that cabin to the presidency. Grant shrugged. “Well I never
thought about it in that light.”
This is also confidence. Which needs neither congratulations nor
glory in which to revel, because it is an honest understanding of our
strengths and weakness that reveals the path to a greater glory: inner
peace and a clear mind.
Confident people know what matters. They know when to ignore
other people’s opinions. They don’t boast or lie to get ahead (and
then struggle to deliver). Confidence is the freedom to set your own
standards and unshackle yourself from the need to prove yourself. A
confident person doesn’t fear disagreement and doesn’t see change—
swapping an incorrect opinion for a correct one—as an admission of
inferiority.
Ego, on the other hand, is unsettled by doubts, afflicted by hubris,
exposed by its own boasting and posturing. And yet it will not probe
itself—or allow itself to be probed—because it knows what might be
found.
But confident people are open, reflective, and able to see
themselves without blinders. All this makes room for stillness, by
removing unnecessary conflict and uncertainty and resentment.
And you? Where are you on this spectrum?
There are going to be setbacks in life. Even a master or a genius
will experience a period of inadequacy when they attempt to learn
new skills or explore new domains. Confidence is what determines
whether this will be a source of anguish or an enjoyable challenge. If
you’re miserable every time things are not going your way, if you
cannot enjoy it when things are going your way because you
undermine it with doubts and insecurity, life will be hell.
And sure, there is no such thing as full confidence, or everpresent confidence. We will waver. We will have doubts. We will find
ourselves in new situations of complete uncertainty. But still, we
want to look inside that chaos and find that kernel of calm
confidence. That was what Kennedy did in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
He had been in tough situations before, like when his PT boat sank in
the Pacific and all appeared to be lost. He learned then that panic
solved nothing, and that salvation rarely came from rash action. He

also learned that he could count on himself and that he could get
through it—if he kept his head. Whatever happened, he told himself
early in the crisis, no one would write The Guns of October about his
handling of it. That was something he could control, and so in that he
found confidence.
This is key. Both egotistical and insecure people make their flaws
central to their identity—either by covering them up or by brooding
over them or externalizing them. For them stillness is impossible,
because stillness can only be rooted in strength.
That’s what we have to focus on.
Don’t feed insecurity. Don’t feed delusions of grandeur.
Both are obstacles to stillness.
Be confident. You’ve earned it.

LET GO

Work done for a reward is much lower than work done
in the Yoga of wisdom. Set thy heart upon thy work,
but never on its reward. Work not for the reward; but
never cease to do thy work.
—THE BHAGAVAD GITA

T

he great archery master Awa Kenzo did not focus on teaching
technical mastery of the bow. He spent almost no time
instructing his students on how to deliberately aim and shoot, telling
them to simply draw a shot back until it “fell from you like ripe fruit.”
He preferred instead to teach his students an important mental
skill: detachment. “What stands in your way,” Kenzo once told his
student Eugen Herrigel, “is that you have too much willful will.” It
was this willful will—the desire to be in control and to dictate the
schedule and the process of everything we’re a part of—that held
Herrigel back from learning, from really mastering the art he
pursued.
What Kenzo wanted students to do was to put the thought of
hitting the target out of their minds. He wanted them to detach even
from the idea of an outcome. “The hits on the target,” he would say,
“are only the outward proof and confirmation of your
purposelessness at its highest, of your egolessness, your selfabandonment, or whatever you like to call this state.”
That state is stillness.

But detachment and purposelessness don’t exactly sound like
productive attitudes, do they? That was exactly the kind of vexing
predicament Kenzo wanted to put his students in. Most of his pupils,
like us, wanted to be told what to do and shown how to do it. We’re
supposed to care, a lot. Willful will should be a strength. That’s
what’s worked for us since we were kids who wanted to excel in
school. How can you improve without it? How can this be the way to
hitting a bull’s-eye?
Well, let’s back up.
Have you ever noticed that the more we want something, the
more insistent we are on a certain outcome, the more difficult it can
be to achieve it? Sports like golf and archery are the perfect examples
of this. When you try to hit the ball really hard, you end up snaphooking it. If you look up to follow the ball, you jerk the club and
slice it into the woods. The energy you’re spending aiming the arrow
—particularly early on—is energy not spent developing your form. If
you’re too conscious of the technical components of shooting, you
won’t be relaxed or smooth enough. As marksmen say these days,
“Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.”
Stillness, then, is actually a way to superior performance.
Looseness will give you more control than gripping tightly—to a
method or a specific outcome.
Obviously an archery master like Kenzo realized that by the early
twentieth century the skills he was teaching were no longer matters
of life and death. Nobody needed to know how to shoot an arrow for
survival. But other skills required to master archery remained
essential: focus, patience, breathing, persistence, clarity. And most of
all, the ability to let go.
What we need in life, in the arts, in sports, is to loosen up, to
become flexible, to get to a place where there is nothing in our way—
including our own obsession with certain outcomes. An actor doesn’t
become his character by thinking about it; he has to let go, dispense
with technique and sink into the role. Entrepreneurs don’t walk the
streets deliberately looking for opportunities—they have to open
themselves up to noticing the little things around them. The same
goes for comedians or even parents trying to raise a good kid.

“Everyone tries to shoot naturally,” Kenzo wrote, “but nearly all
practitioners have some kind of strategy, some kind of shallow,
artificial, calculating technical trick that they rely on when they
shoot. Technical tricks ultimately lead nowhere.”
Mastering our mental domain—as paradoxical as it might seem—
requires us to step back from the rigidity of the word “mastery.” We’ll
get the stillness we need if we focus on the individual steps, if we
embrace the process, and give up chasing. We’ll think better if we
aren’t thinking so hard.
Most students, whether it’s in archery or yoga or chemistry, go
into a subject with a strong intention. They are outcome-focused.
They want to get the best grade or the highest score. They bring their
previous “expertise” with them. They want to skip the unnecessary
steps and get right to the sexy stuff. As a result, they are difficult to
teach and easily discouraged when the journey proves harder than
expected. They are not present. They are not open to experience and
cannot learn.
In Kenzo’s school, it was only when a student had fully
surrendered, when they had detached themselves from even the idea
of aiming, having spent months firing arrows into a hay bale just a
few feet in front of them, that he would finally announce, “Our new
exercise is shooting at a target.” And even then, when they would hit
the target, Kenzo wouldn’t shower the archer with praise.
On the contrary, after a bull’s-eye, Kenzo would urge them to “go
on practicing as if nothing happened.” He’d say the same after a bad
shot. When the students asked for extra instruction, he’d reply,
“Don’t ask, practice!”
He wanted them to get lost in the process. He wanted them to
give up their notions of what archery was supposed to look like. He
was demanding that they be present and empty and open—so they
could learn.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism, the lotus flower
is a powerful symbol. Although it rises out of the mud of a pond or a
river, it doesn’t reach up towering into the sky—it floats freely,
serenely on top of the water. It was said that wherever Buddha
walked, lotus flowers appeared to mark his footprints. In a way, the
lotus also embodies the principle of letting go. It’s beautiful and

pure, but also attainable and lowly. It is simultaneously attached and
detached.
This is the balance we want to strike. If we aim for the trophy in
life—be it recognition or wealth or power—we’ll miss the target. If we
aim too intensely for the target—as Kenzo warned his students—we
will neglect the process and the art required to hit it. What we should
be doing is practicing. What we should be doing is pushing away that
willful will.
The closer we get to mastery, the less we care about specific
results. The more collaborative and creative we are able to be, the
less we will tolerate ego or insecurity. The more at peace we are, the
more productive we can be.
Only through stillness are the vexing problems solved. Only
through reducing our aims are the most difficult targets within our
reach.

ON TO WHAT’S NEXT . . .

If the mind is disciplined, the heart turns quickly from
fear to love.
—JOHN CAGE

T

he stakes of what each of us is trying to do are too high to allow
ourselves to be riven by the chatter of the news or the noise of the
crowd. The insights we seek are often buried and rarely obvious—to
find them, we need to be able to look deeply, to perceive what others
are unable to.
So we ignore the noise. We zero in on what’s essential. We sit
with presence. We sit with our journals. We empty our minds.
We try, in the words of Marcus Aurelius, to “shrug it all off and
wipe it clean—every annoyance and distraction—and reach utter
stillness.” To build a kind of mental vault or stronghold that no
distraction or false impression can breach. For brief moments, we
are able to get there. And when we’re there, we find ourselves
capable of things we didn’t even know were possible: Superior
performance. Awesome clarity. Profound happiness.
Yet that stillness is often fleeting. Why?
Because it is undermined by disturbances elsewhere—not just the
expected turbulence of the surrounding world, but also inside us. In
our spirit and our physical bodies.
“The mind tends toward stillness,” Lao Tzu said, “but is opposed
by craving.” We are like the audience at Marina Abramović’s
performance. Present for a moment. Moved to stillness for a

moment. Then back out into the city, back to the old routines and
pulled by endless desires and bad habits, as if that experience never
happened.
A flash of stillness is not what we’re after. We want consistent
focus and wisdom that can be called upon in even the most trying
situations. Getting there will require more work. It’s going to require
some holistic self-examination, treating the disease and not just the
symptoms.
The premise of this book is that our three domains—the mind, the
heart, and the body—must be in harmony. The truth is that for most
people not only are these domains out of sync, but they are at war
with each other. We will never have peace until that civil war Dr.
King described is settled.
History teaches us that peace is what provides the opportunity to
build. It is the postwar boom that turns nations into superpowers,
and ordinary people into powerhouses.
And so we must go onward to fight the next battle, to pacify the
domain of the spirit and purify our hearts, our emotions, our drives,
our passions.

THE DOMAIN OF THE SOUL

I

n retrospect, it was one of the finest moments in golf, perhaps in
all of sports. In June 2008, Tiger Woods birdied the final hole of
the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, just north of San Diego, to force an
eighteen-hole playoff. He took an early three-stroke lead but
surrendered it, only to come charging back, to birdie again and force
forty-six-year old Rocco Mediate into a head-to-head, sudden-death
round. On that 488-yard par-four, Tiger Woods would birdie a final
time to win his third U.S. Open and his fourteenth major. The second
most major victories in the history of the game.
And Woods was certainly the first person and likely the last golfer
in history to win such a roller-coaster match on a torn ACL and a leg
broken in two places. To call it a triumph of grit and determination
almost undersells Woods’s performance, because he did it with such
poise that no one watching even knew the extent of his injuries.
Woods himself knew only of the fractures, not the fact that his
knee joint was basically gone. Yet somehow, with nearly inhuman
mental and physical discipline, he transcended every limit the
complex and crushing game of golf had tried to place on him, and he
did it with little more than an occasional grimace.
We could call this moment the high-water mark of Tiger Woods’s
career. He took a six-month leave to recover from emergency knee
surgery. Not long after, his mistress, Rachel Uchitel, was caught at
his hotel in Australia, and suddenly the secrets of his personal life
were no longer secret.
When he was confronted by his wife, Tiger tried to lie his way out
of it, but the lies stopped working. Within minutes, Tiger was
sprawled out in a neighbor’s driveway, his SUV crashed into a nearby

fire hydrant and the back windows smashed by a golf club.
Unconscious, his wife weeping over him, he was, for a moment, still,
in a way he had not been perhaps since he was a baby.
It did not last long.
The tabloid nightmare of all tabloid nightmares would ensue—
twenty-one consecutive covers of the New York Post. The text
messages. The affairs with porn stars and Perkins waitresses, frantic
sex in church parking lots, sex even with the twenty-one-year-old
daughters of family friends, all made public. The stint in sex rehab,
the loss of his sponsors, and the $100 million divorce—it all nearly
broke him, as it would break anyone.
He wouldn’t win another major for a decade.
“On the surface of the ocean there is stillness,” the monk Thich
Nhat Hanh has said of the human condition, “but underneath there
are currents.” So it was for Tiger Woods. This man who had become
an icon for his ability to be calm and focused in moments of intense
stress, a man with the physical discipline to pump the emergency
brake on his 129-mile-per-hour swing if he wanted to start over, the
champion of the “stillest” of sports, was at the mercy of insatiable
riptides that lurked beneath his placid demeanor. And as any
seasoned captain of the seas of life can tell you, what’s happening on
the surface of the water doesn’t matter—it’s what’s going on below
that will kill you.
Tiger Woods could stare down opponents and unimaginable
pressure, persevere through the countless obstacles in his career. He
just couldn’t do the same for his own spiritual demons.
The seeds of Tiger’s undoing were sown early. His father, Earl,
was a complicated man. Born into poverty, Earl Woods lived through
the worst of American racism and segregation. He managed to put
himself through college and join the army, where he became a Green
Beret in Vietnam. Beneath the surface of this accomplishment there
were also currents—of narcissism, egotism, dishonesty, and greed. A
simple example: Earl Woods returned from his second tour in
Vietnam with a new wife . . . a fact he neglected to mention to the
wife and three children he already had.
When Tiger was born of that second marriage, Earl Woods was
forty-three years old and not particularly excited to become a father

again. For the first year of Tiger’s life, fatherhood mostly involved
strapping the baby in a high chair while hitting golf balls in the
garage. It was in fact in watching his father play golf—instead of
being able to play like a regular kid—that Tiger developed his almost
unnatural obsession with the game. According to family legend, at
nine months old Tiger slid down from his chair, picked up a club,
and hit a golf ball.
It’s a story that is both cute and utterly abnormal. At age two,
Tiger Woods appeared on The Mike Douglas Show to show off his
golf skills. The audience loved it, but Jimmy Stewart, the other guest
that day, was not amused. “I’ve seen too many precious kids like this
sweet little boy,” he told Douglas backstage, “and too many starryeyed parents.”
Still, his parents’ dedication is undoubtedly what allowed Tiger
Woods to become a great golfer. Thousands of hours in the garage
watching his father hit seared the beautiful mechanics of a swing into
his mind. The thousands more hours they spent at the driving range
and playing golf—thanks in part to the discounted rates Earl Woods
got at the military course near their home—were instrumental. His
parents sacrificed for him, drove him to tournaments, and hired the
best coaches.
They didn’t stop there. Earl Woods knew that golf was a mental
game, so he worked to prepare his son for the unforgiving world of
sports. Starting when Tiger was about seven, Earl took active
measures to develop his son’s concentration. Whenever Tiger teed
off, Earl would cough. Or jingle change in his pocket. Or drop his
clubs. Or throw a ball at him. Or block his line of sight. “I wanted to
teach him mental toughness,” Earl recounted. “If he got distracted by
the little things I did, he’d never be able to handle the pressure of a
tournament.”
But as Tiger got older, the training became, even by Earl’s
admission, an increasingly brutal finishing school. It was a boot
camp of “prisoner-of-war interrogation techniques” and
“psychological intimidation” that no civilized person ought to inflict
on another. “He constantly put me down,” Tiger said later. “He
would push me to the breaking point, then back off. It was wild.”
Yeah. Wild.

That’s what it is for a child to hear his father taunt him as he tries
to play a sport, to call him a “motherfucker” while he’s trying to
concentrate. Imagine how painful it would be to have your dad tell
you to “fuck off,” or to ask, “How do you feel being a little nigger?” to
try to get a rise out of you. Earl Woods even cheated when they
played together, supposedly to keep his son humble and on his game.
As Tiger reflected, this was all deliberate training to become what his
father wanted him to be: a “‘cold-blooded assassin’ on the course.”
Now, Tiger, who clearly loved his father, said that they had a code
word he could use if his father ever pushed too far—in either their
mental or physical training—and that all Tiger had to do was say it
and Earl would stop. Tiger says he never did, because he needed and
enjoyed the training, but even the word itself is illustrative. It wasn’t
a cute inside joke or some silly word that meant nothing. The word
that Tiger could utter to get his father to stop bullying him, to get
him to treat him like a normal child, was, if you can believe it:
enough.
And not only was it never uttered, but the two of them came to
refer to it almost as an expletive: the “e-word.”
The e-word was something quitters said, that only losers believed
in.
Are we surprised, then, that this talented boy would go on to win
so much? But that those wins didn’t make him happy? He was
imperturbable on the golf course and utterly miserable inside.
Tiger’s mother taught him lessons too. She told him, “You will
never, ever ruin my reputation as a parent because I will beat you.”
Notice the threat of physical violence and what it was over—not
doing wrong but embarrassing her. Earl Woods, as a husband,
showed Tiger early on how to balance this razor’s edge too. He
cheated on his wife when he traveled with his son. He drank to
excess. He even, likely in violation of amateur sporting rules,
accepted a secret $50,000-a-year stipend from IMG, the sports
agency that would eventually represent Tiger Woods.
The lesson there? Appearances are the only thing that matters.
Do whatever it takes to win—just don’t get caught.
A less talented and dedicated athlete would have been crippled by
this abuse. But Tiger Woods was not just naturally gifted, he truly

loved golf and he loved the work of it. So he got better and better.
By the time he was three, he was beating ten-year-olds. By eleven
years old, he could beat his father regularly on eighteen-hole courses.
By seventh grade, he was being recruited by Stanford. At Stanford,
where he spent two years, Tiger was an All-American and the
number one player in the country. By the time he went pro at twenty,
it was already obvious that he might become the greatest golfer who
ever lived. The richest too. His first contracts with Nike and Titleist
were worth a combined $60 million.
Tiger Woods’s first decade and a half as a pro stand as possibly
the most dominant reign ever, in any sport. He won everything that
could be won. Fourteen majors, 140 tournaments. He was ranked the
number one golfer in the world for 281 consecutive weeks. He won
more than $115 million in PGA Tour winnings. He won on every
continent except Antarctica.
There were, for those who were looking, signs of sickness: the
thrown clubs after a bad hole—and the lack of concern for the fans
this occasionally imperiled. The way he’d broken up with his
longtime high school girlfriend by packing her suitcase and sending
it to her parents’ hotel room with a letter. The way he responded
when Steve Scott saved him from accidentally scratching in their epic
head-to-head match, not even thanking him, not even acknowledging
the incredible sportsmanship of it—treating it like the weakness of
inferior prey.* The way he’d left his college golf team to go pro
without even saying goodbye to his teammates, the way after he
finished eating with family or friends he’d simply get up and leave
without saying a word. The way he could just cut people out of his
life.
Woods’s golf coach Hank Haney would say that over time Tiger
began to understand that “anyone who was brought into his world
was lucky and would be playing by his rules.” This was what he had
been taught by his parents, who raised him both as a kind of prince
and a prisoner in a psychological experiment. Fame and wealth only
added to this. “I felt I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to
enjoy all the temptations around me,” Tiger would say later. “I felt I
was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn’t have to go far to
find them.”

We can imagine Tiger Woods, like so many successful people,
getting less happy the more he achieved. Less freedom. Less and less
sleep, until it came only with medication. Even with a beautiful,
brilliant wife whom he loved, even with two children, whom he also
loved, even as the undisputed champion of his craft, he was
miserable, tortured by a spiritual malady and a crushing anxiety
from which there was no relief.
His mind was strong but his soul ached. It ached over his tragic
relationship with his father. It ached over the childhood he had lost.
It ached because it ached—Why am I not happy, he must have
thought, don’t I have everything I ever wanted?
It’s not simply that Tiger loved to win. It’s that for so long
winning was not nearly enough and never could be enough (the eword). He would tell Charlie Rose, “Winning was fun. Beating
someone’s even better.” Tiger said this after his public humiliation,
after his multiyear slump, after his stint in sex rehab. He still had not
learned. He still could not see what this attitude had cost him.
Everybody’s got a hungry heart—that’s true. But how we choose
to feed that heart matters. It’s what determines the kind of person we
end up being, what kind of trouble we’ll get into, and whether we’ll
ever be full, whether we’ll ever really be still.
When Tiger Woods’s father died in 2006, Tiger’s extramarital
affairs went into overdrive. He spent time in clubs, partying, instead
of at home with his family. His behavior on the course grew worse,
more standoffish, angrier. He also began to spend unusual amounts
of time with Navy SEALS, indulging in an impossible fantasy that he
might quit golf and join the Special Forces, despite being in his early
thirties (and one of the most famous people in the world). In one
weekend in 2007, Tiger Woods reportedly jumped out of a plane ten
times. In fact, the injuries that plague him to this day are likely a
result of that training, not golf—including an accident where his knee
was kicked out from under him in a military exercise “clearing” a
building.
There he was—rather than enjoying his wealth, success, and
family—cheating on his wife, playing a soldier in some sort of early
midlife crisis. “Mirror, mirror on the wall, we grow up like our daddy
after all,” a friend of Earl and Tiger’s would say of the situation. Like

so many of us, Tiger had unconsciously replicated the most painful
and worst habits of his parents.
Some have looked at those fruitless years after Tiger’s return to
golf as evidence that the selfishness of his previous life helped his
game. Or that somehow the work he did in rehab opened up wounds
better left bound up.
As if Tiger Woods, a human being, did not deserve happiness and
existed solely to win trophies and entertain us on television. “For
what is a man profited,” Jesus asked his disciples, “if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul?”
It’s a question we must ask ourselves. Cheating and lying never
helped anyone in the long run, whether it was done at work or at
home. In Tiger’s case, it was that he was so talented, he could get
away with it . . . until he couldn’t.
Eventually one has to say the e-word, enough. Or the world says it
for you.
In one sense, his father’s training had succeeded. Tiger Woods
was mentally tough. He was cold-blooded and talented. But in every
other part of his life, he was weak and fragile—bankrupt and
unbalanced. That stillness existed only on the golf course;
everywhere else he was at the mercy of his passions and urges. As he
worked to crowd out distractions—anything that would get in the
way of his concentration addressing each shot—he was also crowding
out so many other essential elements of life: An open heart.
Meaningful relationships. Selflessness. Moderation. A sense of right
and wrong.
These are not just important elements of a balanced life; they are
sources of stillness that allow us to endure defeat and enjoy victory.
Mental stillness will be short-lived if our hearts are on fire, or our
souls ache with emptiness. We are incapable of seeing what is
essential in the world if we are blind to what’s going on within us. We
cannot be in harmony with anyone or anything if the need for more,
more, more is gnawing at our insides like a maggot.
“When you live a life where you’re lying all the time, life is no
fun,” Tiger would say later. When your life is out of balance, it’s not
fun. When your life is solely and exclusively about yourself, it’s worse
than not fun—it’s empty and awful. Tiger Woods wasn’t just a

solitary man; he was, like so many of us in the modern world, an
island. He might have been famous, but he was a stranger to himself.
No one who reads about his endless affairs gets the sense that he was
enjoying it or that they brought him much pleasure. In fact, it almost
feels like he wanted to get caught. So he could get help.
We don’t need to judge Tiger Woods. We need to learn from him,
from both his fall and his long and valiant journey back to winning
the Masters in 2019 at forty-three years old with a fused back, with
his own young son cheering him on. Because we share the same
flaws, the same weaknesses—and have the same potential for
greatness, if we are willing to put in the work.
Marcus Aurelius would ask himself, “What am I doing with my
soul? Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-called
mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child’s soul? An
adolescent’s? . . . A tyrant’s soul? The soul of a predator—or its prey?”
We need to ask ourselves these questions, too, especially as we
become successful.
One of the best stories in Zen literature is a series of ten poems
about a farmer and his trouble with a bull. The poems are an allegory
about conquering the self, and the titles of each one map out the
journey that each of us must go on: We search for the bull, we track
the footprints, we find it, we catch it, we tame it, we ride it home.
At first the beast is untamable, it’s wild and impossible to contain.
But the message is that with struggle and perseverance, with selfawareness and patience—with enlightenment, really—eventually we
can tame the emotions and the drives inside us. As one of the poems
reads:
Being well-trained, he becomes
naturally gentle.
Then, unfettered, he obeys his master.
The narrator is in a state of serenity and peace. He has tamed his
wild spirit.
That’s what we’re trying to do. Since ancient times, people have
strived to train and control the forces that reside deep inside them so

that they can find serenity, so that they can preserve and protect
their accomplishments. What good is it to be rational at work if our
personal lives are a hot-blooded series of disasters? How long can we
keep the two domains separate anyway? You might rule cities or a
great empire, but if you’re not in control of yourself, it is all for
naught.
The work we must do next is less cerebral and more spiritual. It’s
work located in the heart and in the soul, and not in the mind.
Because it is our soul that is the key to our happiness (or our
unhappiness), contentment (or discontent), moderation (or
gluttony), and stillness (or perturbation).
That is why those who seek stillness must come to . . .
Develop a strong moral compass.
Steer clear of envy and jealousy and harmful desires.
Come to terms with the painful wounds of their
childhood.
Practice gratitude and appreciation for the world around
them.
Cultivate relationships and love in their lives.
Place belief and control in the hands of something larger
than themselves.
Understand that there will never be “enough” and that
the unchecked pursuit of more ends only in bankruptcy.
Our soul is where we secure our happiness and unhappiness,
contentment or emptiness—and ultimately, determine the extent of
our greatness.
We must maintain a good one.

CHOOSE VIRTUE

The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is
enough.
—RALPH WALDO EMERSON

M

arcus Aurelius famously described a number of what he called
“epithets for the self.” Among his were: Upright. Modest.
Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. These were, then, the traits that
served him well as emperor.
There are many other traits that could be added to this list:
Honest. Patient. Caring. Kind. Brave. Calm. Firm. Generous.
Forgiving. Righteous.
There is one word, however, under which all these epithets sit:
virtue.
Virtue, the Stoics believed, was the highest good—the summum
bonum—and should be the principle behind all our actions. Virtue is
not holiness, but rather moral and civic excellence in the course of
daily life. It’s a sense of pure rightness that emerges from our souls
and is made real through the actions we take.
The East prized virtue as much as the West. The Daodejing, for
instance, actually translates as The Way of Virtue. Confucius, who
advised many of the rulers and princes of his day, would have agreed
with Marcus that a leader was well served by the pursuit of virtue.
His highest compliment would have been to call a ruler a junzi—a
word that translators still have trouble finding equivalents for in

English but is roughly understood as a person who emanates
integrity, honor, and self-control.
If the concept of “virtue” seems a bit stuffy to you, consider the
evidence that a virtuous life is worthwhile for its own sake. No one
has less serenity than the person who does not know what is right or
wrong. No one is more exhausted than the person who, because they
lack a moral code, must belabor every decision and consider every
temptation. No one feels worse about themselves than the cheater or
the liar, even if—often especially if—they are showered with rewards
for their cheating and lying. Life is meaningless to the person who
decides their choices have no meaning.
Meanwhile, the person who knows what they value? Who has a
strong sense of decency and principle and behaves accordingly? Who
possesses easy moral self-command, who leans comfortably upon
this goodness, day in and day out? This person has found stillness.
A sort of soul power they can draw on when they face challenges,
stress, even scary situations.
Look at the response of Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh to an
angry protester during a campaign stop. When the agitated woman
came up and started shouting at him about Islam (despite the fact
that he is Sikh), he replied with two of his own epithets for the self:
“Love and courage.” Soon, the crowd began to chant along with him:
“Love and courage. Love and courage. Love and courage.”
He could’ve stood there and yelled back. He could have run away.
It could have made him cruel and mean, in the moment or forever
after. He may well have been prodded in those directions. But
instead he remained cool, and those two words helped him recenter
in the midst of what not only was a career-on-the-line situation, but
probably felt like a life-threatening one.
Different situations naturally call for different virtues and
different epithets for the self. When we’re going into a tough
assignment, we can say to ourselves over and over again, “Strength
and courage.” Before a tough conversation with a significant other:
“Patience and kindness.” In times of corruption and evil: “Goodness
and honesty.”
The gift of free will is that in this life we can choose to be good or
we can choose to be bad. We can choose what standards to hold

ourselves to and what we will regard as important, honorable, and
admirable. The choices we make in that regard determine whether
we will experience peace or not.
Which is why each of us needs to sit down and examine ourselves.
What do we stand for? What do we believe to be essential and
important? What are we really living for? Deep in the marrow of our
bones, in the chambers of our heart, we know the answer. The
problem is that the busyness of life, the realities of pursuing a career
and surviving in the world, come between us and that selfknowledge.
Confucius said that virtue is a kind of polestar. It not only
provides guidance to the navigator, but it attracts fellow travelers
too. Epicurus, who has been unfairly branded by history as a
hedonist, knew that virtue was the way to tranquility and happiness.
In fact, he believed that virtue and pleasure were two sides of the
same coin. As he said:
It is impossible to live the pleasant life without also living
sensibly, nobly, and justly, and conversely it is impossible
to live sensibly, nobly, and justly without living pleasantly.
A person who does not have a pleasant life is not living
sensibly, nobly, and justly, and conversely the person who
does not have these virtues cannot live pleasantly.
Where virtue is, so too are happiness and beauty.
Confucius wrote that the “gentleman is self-possessed and
relaxed, while the petty man is perpetually full of worry.” It’s worth a
look at Seneca, another Stoic philosopher, who, like Marcus, made
his living in politics. Like us, Seneca was full of contradictions. On
the one hand, his writings contain some of the most beautiful
meditations on morality and self-discipline ever written, and they are
obviously the result of incredible concentration and mental clarity.
On the other, Seneca was a striver—an ambitious writer-politician
who aspired to be remembered as much for his prose as for his
policies.

At the height of his career, he could be found working as a fixer
for the emperor, Nero. Nero, although he had begun as a promising
student of Seneca, did not make his teacher’s job easy. He was
deranged, selfish, distractible, paranoid, and coldhearted. Imagine
that you spend your evenings writing about the importance of doing
the right thing, of temperance and wisdom, and then by day you have
to help your all-powerful boss justify trying to assassinate his
mother. Seneca knew he should walk away; he probably wanted to,
but he never did.
What is virtue? Seneca would ask. His answer: “True and
steadfast judgment.” And from virtue comes good decisions and
happiness and peace. It emanates from the soul and directs the mind
and the body.
Yet when we look at Seneca’s life, we get the sense that he was the
type of man whose ambition did not provide much peace, but instead
skewed his decision making. Seneca wrote eloquently of the
meaninglessness of wealth, yet came to possess an enormous fortune
through questionable means. He believed in mercy, kindness, and
compassion, but he willingly served two different emperors who were
probably psychopaths. It was as if he didn’t believe in his own
philosophy enough to put it wholly into practice—he couldn’t quite
accept that virtue would provide enough to live on.
Money, power, fame just seemed a little more urgent.
Seneca knew of the virtuous path, but chased the prizes that drew
him away from it. This choice cost him many sleepless nights and
forced him into ethically taxing dilemmas. In the end, it cost him his
life. In AD 65, Nero turned on his former teacher and forced him to
commit suicide—the evil Seneca had rationalized for so long, it
eventually cost him everything.
There’s no question it’s possible to get ahead in life by lying and
cheating and generally being awful to other people. This may even be
a quick way to the top. But it comes at the expense of not only your
self-respect, but your security too.
Virtue, on the other hand, as crazy as it might seem, is a far more
attainable and sustainable way to succeed.
How’s that? Recognition is dependent on other people. Getting
rich requires business opportunities. You can be blocked from your

goals by the weather just as easily as you can by a dictator. But
virtue? No one can stop you from knowing what’s right. Nothing
stands between you and it . . . but yourself.
Each of us must cultivate a moral code, a higher standard that we
love almost more than life itself. Each of us must sit down and ask:
What’s important to me? What would I rather die for than betray?
How am I going to live and why?
These are not idle questions or the banal queries of a personality
quiz. We must have the answers if we want the stillness (and the
strength) that emerges from the citadel of our own virtue.
It is for the difficult moments in life—the crossroads that Seneca
found himself on when asked to serve Nero—that virtue can be called
upon. Heraclitus said that character was fate. He’s right. We develop
good character, strong epithets for ourselves, so when it counts, we
will not flinch.
So that when everyone else is scared and tempted, we will be
virtuous.
We will be still.

HEAL THE INNER CHILD

The child is in me still . . . and sometimes not so still.
—FRED ROGERS

T

here was always something childlike about Leonardo da Vinci.
Indeed, this is what made him such a brilliant artist—his
mischievousness, his curiosity, his fascination with inventing and
creating. But behind this playfulness was a deep sadness, pain rooted
in the events of his early life.
Leonardo was born in 1452, an illegitimate son from a prosperous
family of notaries. Though in time his father would invite his bastard
son to come live with him, and would help secure Leonardo’s first
artistic apprenticeship, a distance between them never closed.
At the time, it was customary that the oldest son of a prominent
tradesman like Leonardo’s father would be chosen to take up his
father’s profession and eventually take over his business. While the
notary guild technically did not recognize non legittimo heirs, it’s
surprising that Leonardo’s father never even attempted to appear
before a local magistrate and present a petition to legitimate his son.
Leonardo’s father would go on to have twelve more children, nine
of whom were sons. When he died, he left no specific will, an act that
for a notary, familiar with the law, meant one thing: He was legally
disinheriting Leonardo in favor of his “real” children. As Leonardo’s
biographer Walter Isaacson would later write, by excluding Leonardo
and never fully accepting him, Piero da Vinci’s “primary bequest to

his son was to give him an insatiable drive for an unconditional
patron.”
Indeed, all of Leonardo’s artistic life exhibits an almost childlike
search for love and acceptance from the powerful men he worked for.
He devotedly served his first mentor, Andrea del Verrocchio, for
more than eleven years—until Leonardo was twenty-five—an
incredibly long time for such a prodigal talent (Michelangelo broke
out on his own at sixteen). What could have attracted a sweet soul
like Leonardo to Cesare Borgia, a murderous psychopath? Borgia was
the only patron who was willing to look at and consider Leonardo’s
military inventions—a longtime passion project. From Milan to
France and to the Vatican itself, Leonardo traveled far and wide in
his career, looking for the financial support and artistic freedom he
thought would make him whole.
Nearly half a dozen times, he uprooted himself and his workshop
in a huff, leaving unfinished commissions behind him. Sometimes it
was over a slight. Usually it was because the patron couldn’t quite be
everything Leonardo wanted. The subtext of his angry letters and
half-completed work speaks as loudly to us today as any angry
teenager: You’re not my dad. You can’t tell me what to do. You don’t
really love me. I’ll show you.
Many of us carry wounds from our childhood. Maybe someone
didn’t treat us right. Or we experienced something terrible. Or our
parents were just a little too busy or a little too critical or a little too
stuck dealing with their own issues to be what we needed.
These raw spots shape decisions we make and actions we take—
even if we’re not always conscious of that fact.
This should be a relief: The source of our anxiety and worry, the
frustrations that seem to suddenly pop out in inappropriate
situations, the reason we have trouble staying in relationships or
ignoring criticism—it isn’t us. Well, it is us, just not adult us. It’s the
seven-year-old living inside us. The one who was hurt by Mom and
Dad, the sweet, innocent kid who wasn’t seen.
Think of Rick Ankiel, one of the greatest natural pitchers to ever
play baseball. He had a brutal childhood in the home of an abusive
father and a brother who was a drug dealer. His whole life, he stuffed
this pain and helplessness down, focusing on his skill on the mound,

eventually becoming the minor leagues’ top pitching prospect. Then
suddenly, just as his career was starting to go well, in the first game
of the playoffs in 2000, in front of millions of people, he lost the
ability to control his pitches.
What happened? Just days before, his father and brother had
gone to jail on drug charges and Rick had been in the courthouse to
see them. He’d been running from that pain and that anger for years,
until it finally exploded and shattered the delicate balance that
pitching required. It took years of work with Harvey Dorfman, a
brilliant, patient sports psychologist, to coax his gifts back. And even
then only so far. Ankiel would pitch only five more times in his
career, none as a starter. The rest of his career he spent in the
outfield—mostly in center field, the position farthest away from the
mound.
Sigmund Freud himself wrote about how common it is for
deficiencies, big and small, at a young age to birth toxic, turbulent
attitudes in adulthood. Because we weren’t born rich enough, pretty
enough, naturally gifted enough, because we weren’t appreciated like
other children in the classroom, or because we had to wear glasses or
got sick a lot or couldn’t afford nice clothes, we carry a chip on our
shoulder. Some of us are like Richard III, believing that a deformity
entitles us to be selfish or mean or insatiably ambitious. As Freud
explained, “We all demand reparation for our early wounds to our
narcissism,” thinking we are owed because we were wronged or
deprived. (This was Tiger Woods to the detail.)
It’s dangerous business, though, creating a monster to protect
your wounded inner child.
The insecure lens. The anxious lens. The persecuted lens. The
prove-them-all-wrong lens. The will-you-be-my-father? lens that
Leonardo had. These adaptations, developed early on to make sense
of the world, don’t make our lives easier. On the contrary. Who can
be happy that way? Would you put a nine-year-old in charge of
anything stressful or dangerous or important?
The movie producer Judd Apatow has talked about something he
realized after a big fight during the filming of one of his movies. For
years, he had seen every note the studio or the executives had for
him, every attempt at restrictions or influence, as if it were the

obnoxious meddling of his parents. Instinctively, emotionally, he had
fought and resisted each intervention. Who are these idiots to tell me
what to do? Why are they always trying to boss me around? Why
are they so unfair?
Each of us on occasion has surprised ourself with a strong
reaction to someone’s innocuous comments, or thrown a fit when
some authority figure tried to direct our actions. Or felt the pull of
attraction to a type of relationship that never ends well. Or to a type
of behavior that we know is wrong. It’s almost primal how deep these
feelings go—they’re rooted in our infancy.
It took therapy and self-reflection (and probably the observations
of his wife) for Apatow to understand that the movie studio was not
his parents. This was a business transaction and a creative
discussion, not another instance of a talented boy being bossed
around by otherwise absent parents.
But with that realization came stillness, if only because it
deintensified arguments at work. Think about it: How much better
and less scary life is when we don’t have to see it from the perspective
of a scared, vulnerable child? How much lighter will our load be if
we’re not adding extra baggage on top?
It will take patience and empathy and real self-love to heal the
wounds in your life. As Thich Nhat Hanh has written:
After recognizing and embracing our inner child, the third
function of mindfulness is to soothe and relieve our
difficult emotions. Just by holding this child gently, we are
soothing our difficult emotions and we can begin to feel at
ease. When we embrace our strong emotions with
mindfulness and concentration, we’ll be able to see the
roots of these mental formations. We’ll know where our
suffering has come from. When we see the roots of things,
our suffering will lessen. So mindfulness recognizes,
embraces, and relieves.
Take the time to think about the pain you carry from your early
experiences. Think about the “age” of the emotional reactions you

have when you are hurt or betrayed or unexpectedly challenged in
some way. That’s your inner child. They need a hug from you. They
need you to say, “Hey, buddy. It’s okay. I know you’re hurt, but I am
going to take care of you.”
The functional adult steps in to reassert and reassure. To make
stillness possible.
We owe it to ourselves as well as to the people in our lives to do
this. Each of us must break the link in the chain of what the
Buddhists call samsara, the continuation of life’s suffering from
generation to generation.
The comedian Garry Shandling lost his brother, Barry, at age ten
to cystic fibrosis, and was left for the rest of his life at the mercy of
his distraught and controlling mother, who was so disturbed by the
loss of her older son that she forbade Garry from attending the
funeral for fear that he would see her cry.
But one day, as a much older man, Garry wrote in his diary a
formula that might help him overcome that pain and not only heal
his own inner child but pass on the lesson to the many surrogate
children he had as a mentor and elder in show business.* The
formula was simple and is key to breaking the cycle and stilling the
deep anguish we carry around with us:
Give more.
Give what you didn’t get.
Love more.
Drop the old story.
Try it, if you can.

BEWARE DESIRE

Every man has a passion gnawing away at the bottom
of his heart, just as every fruit has its worm.
—ALEXANDRE DUMAS

J

ohn F. Kennedy achieved indisputable greatness through stillness
in those thirteen fateful days in October 1962. The world is
forever in his debt. But we should not allow that shining moment to
obscure the fact that, like all of us, he had demons that dogged and
haunted him and undermined that same greatness—and as a result,
his stillness.
Kennedy grew up in a house where his father often brought his
mistresses home for dinner and on family vacations. It was a house
where anger and rage were common too. “When I hate some
sonofabitch,” Joseph Kennedy liked to say, “I hate him until I die.”
It’s probably not a surprise, then, that his young son would develop
his own bad habits and wrestle with controlling his urges and
appetites.
The first time Kennedy’s sex drive got him in trouble was during
the early days of World War II, when he began dating Inga Arvad, a
beautiful Dutch journalist who many suspected was a Nazi spy.
When he was running for president, he had an affair with Judith
Exner, who happened to be the girlfriend of Sam Giancana, a
Chicago mobster. But instead of suffering any consequences for
theses massive lapses of judgment, Kennedy skated away clean each
time, a fact that only escalated his risky behavior.

Kennedy was no romantic. Girlfriends would describe his
insatiable but joyless sex drive. According to one conquest, sex was
“just physical and social activity to him,” a way to stave off the
boredom, or get a rush. He didn’t care about the other person, and in
time, he almost didn’t care about the pleasure it gave himself either.
As Kennedy told the prime minister of Britain in a moment of very
uncomfortable honesty, if he went without sex for a few days, he’d
get headaches. (His father had told his sons that he couldn’t sleep
unless he’d “had a lay.”) Given Kennedy’s terrible back, having sex
was probably painful too—but he never let that stop him.
In one shameful moment, as Soviet and American forces teetered
on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy
brought in a nineteen-year-old student from Wheaton College for a
rendezvous in a hotel near the White House. Here was a man who
had no idea how much longer he would live, who was working with
inhuman dedication in that crisis to curb the dangerous impulses of
his nation’s enemies . . . cheating on his wife, choosing to spend what
were potentially his last moments on earth in the sheets with a
random girl half his age instead of with his scared and vulnerable
family.
That doesn’t sound like stillness. It doesn’t sound particularly
glamorous either.
It sounds like a man who is spiritually broken, at the whims of his
worst impulses, unable to think clearly or prioritize. But before we
condemn Kennedy as a despicable addict or abuser, we should look
at our own failings. Do we not fall prey to various desires in our own
personal lives? Do we not know better and do it anyway?
Lust is a destroyer of peace in our lives: Lust for a beautiful
person. Lust for an orgasm. Lust for someone other than the one
we’ve committed to be with. Lust for power. Lust for dominance.
Lust for other people’s stuff. Lust for the fanciest, best, most
expensive things that money can buy.
And is this not at odds with the self-mastery we say we want?
A person enslaved to their urges is not free—whether they are a
plumber or the president.
How many great men and women end up losing everything—end
up, in some cases, literally behind bars—because they freely chose to

indulge their endless appetites, whatever they happened to be?
And at least power and sex and attention are pleasurable. The
most common form of lust is envy—the lust for what other people
have, for the sole reason that they have it. Joseph Epstein’s brilliant
line is: “Of the seven deadly sins, only envy is no fun at all.”
Democritus, twenty-four hundred years before him: “An envious
man pains himself as though he were an enemy.”
No one in the sway of envy or jealousy has a chance to think
clearly or live peacefully. How can they?
It is an endless loop of misery. We’re envious of one person, while
they envy somebody else. The factory worker wishes desperately to
be a millionaire, the millionaire envies the simple life of the nine-tofive worker. The famous wish they could go back to the private life
that so many others would gladly give away; the man or woman with
a beautiful partner thinks only of someone a little more beautiful. It’s
sobering to consider that the rival we’re so jealous of may in fact be
jealous of us.
There is also a “have your cake and eat it too” immaturity to envy.
We don’t simply want what other people have—we want to keep
everything we have and add theirs to it, even if those things are
mutually exclusive (and on top of that, we also want them to not have
it anymore). But if you had to trade places entirely with the person
you envy, if you had to give up your brain, your principles, your
proudest accomplishments to live in their life, would you do it? Are
you willing to pay the price they paid to get what you covet?
No, you aren’t.
Epicurus, again the supposed hedonist, once said that “sex has
never benefited any man, and it’s a marvel if it hasn’t injured him.”
He came up with a good test anytime he felt himself being pulled by a
strong desire: What will happen to me if I get what I want? How
will I feel after?
Indeed, most desires are at their core irrational emotions, and
that’s why stillness requires that we sit down and dissect them. We
want to think ahead to the refractory period, to consider the
inevitable hangover before we take a drink. When we do that, these
desires lose some of their power.

To the Epicureans real pleasure was about freedom from pain
and agitation. If wanting something makes you miserable while you
don’t have it, doesn’t that diminish the true value of the reward? If
getting what you “want” has its consequences too, is that really
pleasurable? If the same drive that helps you achieve initially also
leads you inevitably to overreach or overdo, is it really an advantage?
Those seeking stillness need not become full-fledged ascetics or
puritans. But we can take the time to realize how much pull and
power desire can have on us, and beyond the momentary pleasure
this might provide us, it deprives us of the deeper peace that we seek.
Think about the times when you feel best. It’s not when you are
pining away. It’s not when you get what you pined for either. There is
always a tinge of disappointment or loss at the moment of
acquisition.
Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita calls desire the “ever-present
enemy of the wise . . . which like a fire cannot find satisfaction.” The
Buddhists personified this demon in the figure of Mara. They said it
was Mara who tried to tempt and distract Buddha from the path of
enlightenment, from stillness. When Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his
notebook about how to portray envy, he said that she should be
shown as lean and haggard due to her state of perpetual torment.
“Make her heart gnawed by a swelling serpent,” he said, “make her
ride upon death because Envy never dies.” It’d be hard to find a
better depiction of lust either, which Leonardo said puts us “on the
level of beasts.”
None of us are perfect. We have biologies and pathologies that
will inevitably trip us up. What we need then is a philosophy and a
strong moral code—that sense of virtue—to help us resist what we
can, and to give us the strength to pick ourselves back up when we
fail and try to do and be better.
We can also rely on tools to help us resist harmful desires. Saint
Athanasius of Alexandria wrote in his Vita Antonii that one of the
benefits of journaling—Confessions, as the Christians called the
genre—was that it helped stop him from sinning. By observing and
then writing about his own behavior, he was able to hold himself
accountable and make himself better:

Let us each note and write down our actions and impulses
of the soul . . . as though we were to report them to each
other; and you may rest assured that from utter shame of
becoming known we shall stop sinning and entertaining
sinful thoughts altogether. . . . Just as we would not give
ourselves to lust within sight of each other, so if we were to
write down our thoughts as if telling them to each other,
we shall so much the more guard ourselves against foul
thoughts for shame of being known. Now, then, let the
written account stand for the eyes of our fellow ascetics, so
that blushing at writing the same as if we were actually
seen, we may never ponder evil.
To have an impulse and to resist it, to sit with it and examine it,
to let it pass by like a bad smell—this is how we develop spiritual
strength. This is how we become who we want to be in this world.
Only those of us who take the time to explore, to question, to
extrapolate the consequences of our desires have an opportunity to
overcome them and to stop regrets before they start. Only they know
that real pleasure lies in having a soul that’s true and stable, happy
and secure.

ENOUGH

History relates no instance in which a conqueror has
been surfeited with conquests.
—STEFAN ZWEIG

T

he writers Kurt Vonnegut, the author of Slaughterhouse Five,
and Joseph Heller, the author of Catch-22, were once at a party
in a fancy neighborhood outside New York City. Standing in the
palatial second home of some boring billionaire, Vonnegut began to
needle his friend. “Joe,” he said, “how does it feel that our host only
yesterday may have made more money than your novel has earned in
its entire history?”
“I’ve got something he can never have,” Heller replied.
“And what on earth could that be?” Vonnegut asked.
“The knowledge that I’ve got enough.”
Earl Woods called that the e-word, like it was an expletive. In
truth, enough is a beautiful thing.
Imagine the stillness that sense of enough brought Joseph Heller
and everyone else who has it. No ceaseless wanting. No insecurity of
comparison. Feeling satisfied with yourself and your work? What
gift!
Saying the word “enough” is not enough. Deeply spiritual,
introspective work is required to understand what that idea means—
work that may well destroy illusions and assumptions we have held
our entire lives.

John Stuart Mill, the philosopher and boy genius who before he
hit puberty read and mastered nearly every major classical text in the
original Greek or Latin, is an illustration of just how terrifying this
process can be. Extremely driven (by his father and by himself), one
day, at around twenty years old, Mill stopped to think, for the first
time, about what he was chasing. As he writes:
It occurred to me to put the question directly to myself,
“Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all
the changes in institutions and opinions which you are
looking forward to, could be completely effected at this
very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to
you?” And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly
answered, “No!” At this my heart sank within me: the
whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell
down.
What ensued was a devastating mental breakdown that required
years of recovery. Yet Mill was probably lucky to undergo it so early.
Most people never learn that their accomplishments will ultimately
fail to provide the relief and happiness we tell ourselves they will. Or
they come to understand this only after so much time and money, so
many relationships and moments of inner peace, were sacrificed on
the altar of achievement. We get to the finish line only to think: This
is it? Now what?
It is a painful crossroads. Or worse, one that we ignore, stuffing
those feelings of existential crisis down, piling on top of them
meaningless consumption, more ambition, and the delusion that
doing more and more of the same will eventually bring about
different results.
In a way, this is a curse of one of our virtues. No one achieves
excellence or enlightenment without a desire to get better, without a
tendency to explore potential areas of improvement. Yet the desire—
or the need—for more is often at odds with happiness. Billie Jean
King, the tennis great, has spoken about this, about how the
mentality that gets an athlete to the top so often prevents them from

enjoying the thing they worked so hard for. The need for of progress
can be the enemy of enjoying the process.
There is no stillness for the person who cannot appreciate things
as they are, particularly when that person has objectively done so
much. The creep of more, more, more is like a hydra. Satisfy one—
lop it off the bucket list—and two more grow in its place.
The best insights on enough come to us from the East. “When you
realize there is nothing lacking,” Lao Tzu says, “the whole world
belongs to you.” The verse in The Daodejing:
The greatest misfortune is to not know contentment.
The word calamity is the desire to acquire.
And so those who know the contentment of contentment are
always content.
The Western philosophers wrestled with the balance between
getting more and being satisfied. Epicurus: “Nothing is enough for
the man to whom enough is too little.” Thomas Traherne: “To have
blessings and to prize them is to be in Heaven; to have them and not
to prize them is to be in Hell. . . . To prize them and not to have them
is to be in Hell.” And the Stoics who lived in the material world of an
empire at its peak knew the truth about money. Seneca had piles of it
and he knew how little it correlated with peace. His work is filled
with stories of people who drove themselves to ruin and misery
chasing money they didn’t need and honors beyond their share.
Temperance. That’s the key. Intellectually, we know this. It’s only
in flashes of insight or tragedy that we feel it.
In 2010, Marco Rubio was pacing the halls of his home, making
fund-raising calls for his surprise Senate bid, when his three-year-old
son snuck out the back door and fell into the pool. Rubio had heard
the chime of the door opening, assumed someone else was paying
attention, and returned to his important phone call. A few minutes
later, he found his son floating facedown in their pool, barely
breathing.
Even after this near tragedy he returned almost immediately to
work—his ambition, like Lincoln’s, a “little engine that knew no rest.”

Only with distance could Rubio begin to see the cost of this drive,
what important things we miss when we give ourselves over to it
entirely. As he wrote, “I think I understand now that the restlessness
we feel as we make our plans and chase our ambitions is not the
effect of their importance to our happiness and our eagerness to
attain them. We are restless because deep in our hearts we know now
that our happiness is found elsewhere, and our work, no matter how
valuable it is to us or to others, cannot take its place. But we hurry on
anyway, and attend to our business because we need to matter, and
we don’t always realize we already do.”
Have you ever held a gold medal or a Grammy or a Super Bowl
ring? Have you ever seen a bank balance nudging up into the seven
figures? Maybe you have, maybe you possess these things yourself. If
you do, then you know: They are nice but they change nothing. They
are just pieces of metal, dirty paper in your pocket, or plaques on a
wall. They are not made of anything strong or malleable enough to
plug even the tiniest hole in a person’s soul. Nor do they extend the
length of one’s life even one minute. On the contrary, they may
shorten it!
They can also take the joy out of the thing we used to love to do.
More does nothing for the one who feels less than, who cannot see
the wealth that was given to them at birth, that they have
accumulated in their relationships and experiences. Solving your
problem of poverty is an achievable goal and can be fixed by earning
and saving money. No one could seriously claim otherwise. The issue
is when we think these activities can address spiritual poverty.
Accomplishment. Money. Fame. Respect. Piles and piles of them
will never make a person feel content.
If you believe there is ever some point where you will feel like
you’ve “made it,” when you’ll finally be good, you are in for an
unpleasant surprise. Or worse, a sort of Sisyphean torture where just
as that feeling appears to be within reach, the goal is moved just a
little bit farther up the mountain and out of reach.
You will never feel okay by way of external accomplishments.
Enough comes from the inside. It comes from stepping off the train.
From seeing what you already have, what you’ve always had.

If a person can do that, they are richer than any billionaire, more
powerful than any sovereign.
Yet instead of seizing this path to power, we choose ingratitude
and the insecurity of needing more, more, more. “We are here as if
immersed in water head and shoulders underneath the great
oceans,” said the Zen master Gensha, “and yet how pitiously we are
extending our hands for water.” We think we need more and don’t
realize we already have so much. We work so hard “for our families”
that we don’t notice the contradiction—that it’s because of work that
we never see them.
Enough.
Now, there is a perfectly understandable worry that contentment
will be the end of our careers—that if we somehow satisfy this urge,
all progress in our work and in our lives will come to a screeching
halt. If everyone felt good, why would they keep trying so hard?
First, it must be pointed out that this worry itself is hardly an ideal
state of mind. No one does their best work driven by anxiety, and no
one should be breeding insecurity in themselves so that they might
keep making things. That is not industry, that is slavery.
We were not put on this planet to be worker bees, compelled to
perform some function over and over again for the cause of the hive
until we die. Nor do we “owe it” to anyone to keep doing, doing,
doing—not our fans, not our followers, not our parents who have
provided so much for us, not even our families. Killing ourselves does
nothing for anybody.
It’s perfectly possible to do and make good work from a good
place. You can be healthy and still and successful.
Joseph Heller believed he had enough, but he still kept writing.
He wrote six novels after Catch-22 (when a reporter criticized him by
saying he hadn’t written anything as good as his first book, Heller
replied, “Who has?”), including a number one bestseller. He taught.
He wrote plays and movies. He was incredibly productive. John
Stuart Mill, after his breakdown, fell in love with poetry, met the
woman who would eventually become his wife, and began to slowly
return to political philosophy—and ultimately had enormous impact
on the world. Indeed, Western democracies are indebted to him for
many changes he helped bring about.

The beauty was that these creations and insights came from a
better—a stiller—place inside both men. They weren’t doing it to
prove anything. They didn’t need to impress anyone. They were in
the moment. Their motivations were pure. There was no insecurity.
No anxiety. No creeping, painful hope that this would finally be the
thing that would make them feel whole, that would give them what
they had always been lacking.
What do we want more of in life? That’s the question. It’s not
accomplishments. It’s not popularity. It’s moments when we feel like
we are enough.
More presence. More clarity. More insight. More truth.
More stillness.

BATHE IN BEAUTY

In the face of the Sublime, we feel a shiver . . .
something too large for our minds to encompass. And
for a moment, it shakes us out of our smugness and
releases us from the deathlike grip of habit and
banality.
—ROBERT GREENE

O

n Wednesday morning, February 23, 1944, Anne Frank climbed
up to the attic above the annex where her family had been
hiding for two long years to visit Peter, the young Jewish boy who
lived with them. After Peter finished his chores, the two of them sat
down at Anne’s favorite spot on the floor and looked out the small
window to the world they had been forced to leave behind.
Staring at the blue sky, the leafless chestnut tree below, birds
swooping and diving in the air, the two were entranced to the point
of speechlessness. It was so quiet, so serene, so open compared to
their cramped quarters.
It was almost as if the world wasn’t at war, as if Hitler had not
already killed so many millions of people and their families didn’t
spend each day at risk of joining the dead. Despite it all, beauty
seemed to reign. “As long as this exists,” Anne thought to herself,
“this sunshine and this cloudless sky, and as long as I can enjoy it,
how can I be sad?”
She would later write in her diary that nature was a kind of cureall, a comfort available to any and all who suffer. Indeed, whether it

was the blooming of spring or the starkness of winter, even when it
was dark and raining, when it was too dangerous to open the window
and she had to sit in the stifling, suffocating heat to do it, Anne
always managed to find in nature something to boost her spirits and
center herself. “Beauty remains, even in misfortune,” she wrote. “If
you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and
regain your balance.”
How true that is. And what a source of peace and strength it can
be.
The trackless woods. A quiet child, lying on her belly, reading a
book. The clouds cutting over the wing of an airplane, its exhausted
passengers all asleep. A man reading in his seat. A woman sleeping.
A stewardess resting her feet. The rosy fingertips of dawn coming up
over the mountain. A song on repeat. That song’s beat, lining up
exactly with the rhythm of events. The pleasure of getting an
assignment in before a deadline, the temporary quiet of an empty
inbox.
This is stillness.
Rose Lane Wilder wrote of looking out over the grassy plateau in
Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia:
Here there was only sky, and a stillness made audible by
the brittle grass. Emptiness was so perfect all around me
that I felt a part of it, empty myself; there was a moment in
which I was nothing at all—almost nothing at all.
The term for this is exstasis—a heavenly experience that lets us
step outside ourselves. And these beautiful moments are available to
us whenever we want them. All we have to do is open our souls to
them.
There is a story about the Zen master Hyakujo, who was
approached by two students as he began his morning chores on the
farm attached to his temple. When the students asked him to teach
them about the Way, he replied, “You open the farm for me and I will
talk to you about the great principle of Zen.” After they finished their
labors and walked to the master for their lesson, he simply turned to

face the fields, which the sun was just then rising above, extended his
arms out in the direction of the serene expanse, and said nothing.
That was the Way. Nature. The cultivated soil. The growing crops.
The satisfaction of good hard work. The poetry of the earth. As it was
in the beginning, as it will be forever.
Not that all beauty is so immediately beautiful. We’re not always
on the farm or at the beach or gazing out over sweeping canyon
views. Which is why the philosopher must cultivate the poet’s eye—
the ability to see beauty everywhere, even in the banal or the terrible.
Marcus Aurelius, who is supposedly this dark, depressive Stoic,
loved beauty in his own Whitmanesque way. Why else would he write
so vividly of the ordinary way that “baking bread splits in places and
those cracks, while not intended in the baker’s art, catch our eye and
serve to stir our appetite,” or the “charm and allure” of nature’s
process, the “stalks of ripe grain bending low, the frowning brow of
the lion, the foam dripping from the boar’s mouth.” Even of dying, he
writes, “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with
nature. Come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened
olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to
the tree that gave it growth.”
The philosopher and the poet, seeing the world the same way,
both engaged in the same pursuit, as Thomas Aquinas said, the study
of “wonder.”
It was Edward Abbey, the environmental activist and writer, who
said that even the word wildness itself was music. It’s music we can
listen to anytime we like, wherever we live, whatever we do for a
living. Even if we can’t visit, we can think of traipsing through the
pine-bedded floor of the forest, of drifting down a slow-moving river,
of the warmth of a campfire. Or, like Anne Frank, we can simply look
out our window to see a tree. In doing this, in noticing, we become
alive to the stillness.
It is not the sign of a healthy soul to find beauty in superficial
things—the adulation of the crowd, fancy cars, enormous estates,
glittering awards. Nor to be made miserable by the ugliness of the
world—the critics and haters, the suffering of the innocent, injuries,
pain and loss. It is better to find beauty in all places and things.
Because it does surround us. And will nourish us if we let it.

The soft paw prints of a cat on the dusty trunk of a car. The hot
steam wafting from the vents on a New York City morning. The smell
of asphalt just as the rain begins to fall. The thud of a fist fitting
perfectly into an open hand. The sound of a pen signing a contract,
binding two parties together. The courage of a mosquito sucking
blood from a human who can so easily crush it. A basket full of
vegetables from the garden. The hard right angles that passing trucks
cut out of the drooping branches of trees next to a busy road. A floor
filled with a child’s toys, arranged in the chaos of exhausted
enjoyment. A city arranged the same way, the accumulation of
hundreds of years of spasmodic, independent development.
Are you starting to see how this works?
It’s ironic that stillness is rare and fleeting in our busy lives,
because the world creates an inexhaustible supply of it. It’s just that
nobody’s looking.
After his breakdown and nearly two years of struggle and
depression resulting from overstimulation and too much study,
where did John Stuart Mill find peace again for the first time? In the
poetry of William Wordsworth. And what was the inspiration of so
much of Wordsworth’s poetry? Nature.
Theodore Roosevelt was sent west by his doctor after the death of
his mother and wife to lose himself in the bigness of the Dakota
Badlands. Yes, Teddy was a hunter and a rancher and a man’s man,
but his two greatest passions? Sitting quietly on a porch with a book
and birdwatching. The Japanese have a concept, shinrin yoku—
forest bathing—which is a form of therapy that uses nature as a
treatment for mental and spiritual issues. Hardly a week passed,
even when he was president, that Roosevelt didn’t take a forest bath
of some kind.
How much cleaner we would feel if we took these baths as often
as we took hot showers. How much more present we would be if we
saw what was around us.
Bathe is an important word. There is something about water, isn’t
there? The sight of it. The sound of it. The feel of it. Those seeking
stillness could find worse ways to wash away the troubles and
turbulence of the world than actual water. A dive into a nearby river.
The bubbling fountain in a Zen garden. The reflecting pool of a

memorial for those we have lost. Even, in a pinch, a sound machine
loaded with the noises of the crashing ocean waves.
To those reeling from trauma or a stressful profession as much as
to those suffering from the ennui of modern life, Professor John
Stilgoe has simple advice:
Get out now. Not just outside, but beyond the trap of the
programmed electronic age so gently closing around so
many people. . . . Go outside, move deliberately, then
relax, slow down, look around. Do not jog. Do not run. . . .
Instead pay attention to everything that abuts the rural
road, the city street, the suburban boulevard. Walk. Stroll.
Saunter. Ride a bike and coast along a lot. Explore.
There is peace in this. It is always available to you.
Don’t let the beauty of life escape you. See the world as the temple
that it is. Let every experience be churchlike. Marvel at the fact that
any of this exists—that you exist. Even when we are killing each other
in pointless wars, even when we are killing ourselves with pointless
work, we can stop and bathe in the beauty that surrounds us, always.
Let it calm you. Let it cleanse you.

ACCEPT A HIGHER POWER

Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself.
—ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE

F

or nearly a hundred years, one of the most difficult steps in the
twelve steps of “recovery” has not been producing a fearless
moral inventory of one’s failings or the making of amends. It’s not
admitting you have a problem, finding a sponsor, or attending
meetings.
The step that many addicts—particularly the ones who fancy
themselves thinkers—struggle with intensely is the acknowledgment
of the existence of a higher power. They just don’t want to admit that
they “have come to believe a Power greater than themselves could
restore them to sanity.”
This seemingly simple step is hard, but not because the world has
become increasingly secular since Alcoholics Anonymous’s founding
in 1935. In fact, one of the founders of AA was, in his words, a
“militant agnostic.” Acknowledging a higher power is difficult
because submitting to anything other than their own desires is
anathema to what one addict describes as the “pathological selfcenteredness” of addiction.
“I don’t believe in God” is the most common objection to Step 2.
“There’s no evidence of a higher power,” they say. “Look at evolution.
Look at science.” Or they might question what the hell any of this has
to do with sobriety anyway. Can’t they just stop using drugs and

follow the other steps? “What does religion or faith have to do with
anything?”
These are perfectly reasonable questions. And yet they don’t
matter.
Because Step 2 isn’t really about God. It’s about surrender. It’s
about faith.
Remember, the only way to get over the willful will—the force
that Awa Kenzo believed was causing everyone, not just addicts, to
miss the targets we aim for—is to let go, at the deep, soul level.
While addiction is undoubtedly a biological disease, it is also, in a
more practical sense, a process of becoming obsessed with one’s own
self and the primacy of one’s urges and thoughts. Therefore,
admitting that there is something bigger than you out there is an
important breakthrough. It means an addict finally understands that
they are not God, that they are not in control, and really never have
been. By the way, none of us are.
The twelve-step process is not itself transformative. It’s the
decision to stop and to listen and to follow that does all the work.
If you really look at the teachings, Alcoholics Anonymous doesn’t
say you have to believe in Jesus or go to church. Only that you accept
“God as we understand him.” That means that if you want to believe
in Mother Earth, or Providence, or Destiny, or Fate, or Random
Luck, that’s up to you.
To the Stoics, their higher power was the logos—the path of the
universe. They acknowledged fate and fortune and the power these
forces had over them. And in acknowledging these higher powers,
they accessed a kind of stillness and peace (most simply because it
meant less fighting battles for control!) that helped them run
empires, survive slavery or exile, and ultimately even face death with
great poise. In Chinese philosophy, dao—the Way—is the natural
order of the universe, the way of a higher spirit. The Greeks not only
believed in many different gods, but also that individuals were
accompanied by a daemon, a guiding spirit that led them to their
destiny.
The Confucians believed in Tian, —a concept of heaven that
guided us while we were here on earth and assigned us a role or
purpose in life. The Hindus believed that Brahman was the highest

天

universal reality. In Judaism, Yahweh (
) is the word for Lord.
Each of the major Native American tribes had their own word for the
Great Spirit, who was their creator and guiding deity. Epicurus
wasn’t an atheist but rejected the idea of an overbearing or
judgmental god. What deity would want the world to live in fear?
Living in fear, he said, is incongruent with ataraxia.
When Krishna speaks of the “mind resting in the stillness of the
prayer of Yoga,” it is the same thing. The Christians believe that God
is that source of stillness in our lives, which extended peace and
comfort to us like a river. “Peace! Be still!” Jesus said to the sea, “and
the wind ceased and there was a great calm.”
There is no stillness to the mind that thinks of nothing but itself,
nor will there ever be peace for the body and spirit that follow their
every urge and value nothing but themselves.
The progress of science and technology is essential. But for many
of us moderns, it has come at the cost of losing the capacity for awe
and for acknowledging forces beyond our comprehension. It has
deprived us of the ability to access spiritual stillness and piety.
Are we really to say that a simple peasant who piously believed in
God, who worshipped daily in a beautiful cathedral that must have
seemed a wondrous glory to the greatness of the Holy Spirit, was
worse off than us because he or she lacked our technology or an
understanding of evolution? If we told a Zen Buddhist from Japan in
the twelfth century that in the future everyone could count on greater
wealth and longer lives but that in most cases those gifts would be
followed by a feeling of utter purposelessness and dissatisfaction, do
you think they would want to trade places with us?
Because that doesn’t sound like progress.
In his 1978 commencement address to the students of Harvard,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn spoke of a modern world where all countries
—capitalist and communist alike—had been pervaded by a
“despiritualized and irreligious humanistic consciousness.”
To such consciousness, man is the touchstone in judging
everything on earth—imperfect man, who is never free of
pride, self-interest, envy, vanity, and dozens of other
defects. We are now experiencing the consequences of

mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of
the journey. On the way from the Renaissance to our days
we have enriched our experience, but we have lost the
concept of a Supreme Complete Entity which used to
restrain our passions and our irresponsibility. We have
placed too much hope in political and social reforms, only
to find out that we were being deprived of our most
precious possession: our spiritual life.
Realism is important. Pragmatism and scientism and skepticism
are too. They all have their place. But still, you have to believe in
something. You just have to. Or else everything is empty and cold.
The comedian Stephen Colbert survived a tragic childhood guided
by a deep and earnest Catholic faith that he maintains to this day
(teaching Sunday school well into his show business career). His
mother, who bore the brunt of that tragedy when she lost her
husband and two sons in a plane crash, was his example. “Try to look
at this moment in the light of eternity,” she would tell him. Eternity.
Something bigger than us. Something bigger than we can possibly
comprehend. Something longer than our tiny humanness naturally
considers.
We could find a similar story for just about every faith.
It is probably not a coincidence that when one looks back at
history and marvels at the incredible adversity and unimaginable
difficulty that people made it through, you tend to find that they all
had one thing in common: Some kind of belief in a higher deity. An
anchor in their lives called faith. They believed an unfailing hand
rested on the wheel, and that there was some deeper purpose or
meaning behind their suffering even if they couldn’t understand it.
It’s not a coincidence that the vast majority of people who did good
in the world did too.
The reformer Martin Luther was called before a tribunal
demanding that he recant his beliefs, on threat of denunciation and
possibly death. He spent hours in prayer as he waited his turn to
testify. He breathed in. He emptied his mind of worry and fear. He
spoke. “I cannot and I will not retract, for it is unsafe for a Christian

to speak against his conscience. Here I stand, I can do no other; so
help me God. Amen.”
Is it not interesting that the leaders who end up truly tested by
turbulent times end up sincerely relying on some measure of faith
and belief to get them through difficult times?
That was the story of Lincoln. Like many smart young people, he
was an atheist early in life, but the trials of adulthood, especially the
loss of his son and the horrors of the Civil War, turned him into a
believer. Kennedy spent most of his life looking down on his parents’
Catholicism . . . but you can bet he was praying as he stood up to the
threat of nuclear annihilation.
Here I stand, I can do no other; so help me God.
Nihilism is a fragile strategy. It’s always the nihilists who seem to
go crazy or kill themselves when life gets hard. (Or, more recently,
are so afraid of dying that they obsess about living forever.)
Why is that? Because the nihilist is forced to wrestle with the
immense complexity and difficulty and potential emptiness of life
(and death) with nothing but their own mind. This is a comically
unfair mismatch.
Again, when nearly all the wise people of history agree, we should
pause and reflect. It’s next to impossible to find an ancient
philosophical school that does not talk about a higher power (or
higher powers). Not because they had “evidence” of its existence, but
because they knew how powerful faith and belief were, how essential
they were to the achievement of stillness and inner peace.
Fundamentalism is different. Epicurus was right—if God exists,
why would they possibly want you to be afraid of them? And why
would they care what clothes you wear or how many times you pay
obeisance to them per day? What interest would they have in
monuments or in fearful pleas for forgiveness? At the purest level,
the only thing that matters to any father or mother—or any creator—
is that their children find peace, find meaning, find purpose. They
certainly did not put us on this planet so we could judge, control, or
kill each other.
But this is not the problem most of us are dealing with. Instead
we struggle with skepticism, with an egotism that puts us at the
center of the universe. That’s why the philosopher Nassim Taleb’s

line is so spot on: It’s not that we need to believe that God is great,
only that God is greater than us.
Even if we are the products of evolution and randomness, does
this not take us right back to the position of the Stoics? As subjects to
the laws of gravity and physics, are we not already accepting a
higher, inexplicable power?
We have so little control of the world around us, so many
inexplicable events created this world, that it works out almost
exactly the same way as if there was a god.
The point of this belief is in some ways to override the mind. To
quiet it down by putting it in true perspective. The common language
for accepting a higher power is about “letting [Him or Her or It] into
your heart.” That’s it. This is about rejecting the tyranny of our
intellect, of our immediate observational experience, and accepting
something bigger, something beyond ourselves.
Perhaps you’re not ready to do that, to let anything into your
heart. That’s okay. There’s no rush.
Just know that this step is open to you. It’s waiting. And it will
help restore you to sanity when you’re ready.

ENTER RELATIONSHIPS

There is no enjoying the possession of anything
valuable unless one has someone to share it with.
—SENECA

A

fter his first marriage fell apart in the 1960s, the songwriter
Johnny Cash moved from Southern California to Tennessee. On
the first night in his new home, lonely and depressed, he began to
pace the length of the ground floor. It was an enormous house, all
but empty of furniture, wedged between a steep hill on one side and
Old Hickory Lake on the other. As he walked from one end of the
floor to the other, from the hill to the lake, he began to feel, almost
frantically, that something was absent.
What’s missing? he thought. Where is it? he repeated, over and
over again. Had he forgotten to pack something? Was there
something he needed to do? What wasn’t right?
Suddenly, it came to him. It wasn’t something, it was someone.
His young daughter, Rosanne. She wasn’t there. She was in
California with her mother. A house without family is no home.
Johnny Cash stopped, began to shout her name as loud as he could,
and fell to the ground and wept.
In some sense, it might seem like that is exactly the kind of
anguish that philosophy helps us avoid through the cultivation of
detachment and indifference to other people. If you don’t make
yourself dependent on anyone, if you don’t make yourself vulnerable,
you can never lose them and you’ll never be hurt.

There are people who try to live this way. They take vows of
chastity or solitude, or, conversely, try to reduce relationships to
their most transactional or minimal form. Or because they have been
hurt before, they put up walls. Or because they are so talented, they
dedicate themselves exclusively to their work. It is necessary, they
say, for they have a higher calling. The Buddha, for instance, walked
out on his wife and young son without even saying goodbye, because
enlightenment was more important.
Yes, every individual should make the life choices that are right
for them. Still, there is something deeply misguided—and terribly
sad—about a solitary existence.
It is true that relationships take time. They also expose and
distract us, cause pain, and cost money.
We are also nothing without them.
Bad relationships are common, and good relationships are hard.
Should that surprise us? Being close to and connecting with other
people challenges every facet of our soul.
Especially when our inner child is there, acting out. Or we are
pulled away by lust and desire. Or our selfishness makes little room
for another person.
The temptations of the world lead us astray, and our tempers hurt
the ones we love.
A good relationship requires us to be virtuous, faithful, present,
empathetic, generous, open, and willing to be a part of a larger
whole. It requires, in order to create growth, real surrender.
No one would say that’s easy.
But rising to this challenge—even attempting to rise to it—
transforms us . . . if we let it.
Anyone can be rich or famous. Only you can be Dad or Mom or
Daughter or Son or Soul Mate to the people in your life.
Relationships come in many forms. Mentor. Protégé. Parent.
Child. Spouse. Best friend.
And even if, as some have argued, maintaining these
relationships reduces a person’s material or creative success, might
the trade be worth it?
“Who is there who would wish to be surrounded by all the riches
in the world and enjoy every abundance in life and yet not love or be

loved by anyone?” was Cicero’s question some two thousand years
ago. It echoes on down to us, still true forever.
Even paragons of stillness struggle with what connection and
dependence might mean for their careers. Marina Abramović gave a
controversial interview in 2016 where she explained her choice to
stay single and not to have children. That would have been a disaster
for her art, she said. “One only has limited energy in the body, and I
would have had to divide it.”
Nonsense.
Nonsense that has been internalized by countless driven and
ambitious people.
How well they would do to take even a cursory look at history and
literature. German chancellor Angela Merkel has been tirelessly
supported by her husband, a man she has described as vital to her
success, and upon whose advice she depends. Gertrude Stein was
tirelessly supported by her life partner, Alice B. Toklas. Madame
Curie was long cynical about love, until she met Pierre, whom she
married and with whom she collaborated and ultimately won a Nobel
Prize. What about the dedication to On Liberty, John Stuart Mill’s
greatest work, where he calls his wife “inspirer, and in part the
author, of all that is best in my writings”? The rapper J. Cole has said
that the best thing he ever did as a musician was become a husband
and a father. “There was no better decision I could have made,” he
said, “than the discipline I put on myself of having responsibility,
having another human being—my wife—that I have to answer to.”
Stillness is best not sought alone. And, like success, it is best
when shared. We all need someone who understands us better than
we understand ourselves, if only to keep us honest.
Relationships are not a productivity hack, though understanding
that love and family are not incompatible with any career is a
breakthrough. It is also true that the single best decision you can
make in life, professionally and personally, is to find a partner who
complements and supports you and makes you better and for whom
you do the same. Conversely, choosing partners and friends who do
the opposite endangers both career and happiness.
Life without relationships, focused solely on accomplishment, is
empty and meaningless (in addition to being precarious and fragile).

A life solely about work and doing is terribly out of balance; indeed,
it requires constant motion and busyness to keep from falling apart.
The writer Philip Roth spoke proudly late in life about living
alone and being responsible or committed to nothing but his own
needs. He once told an interviewer that his lifestyle meant he could
be always on call for his work, never having to wait for or on anyone
but himself. “I’m like a doctor and it’s an emergency room,” he said.
“And I’m the emergency.”
That may be just about the saddest thing a person has ever said
without realizing it.
Dorothy Day, the Catholic nun, spoke of the long loneliness we all
experience, a form of suffering to which the only solution is love and
relationships. And yet some people inflict this on themselves on
purpose! They deprive themselves of the heaven that is having
someone to care about and to care about you in return.
The world hurls at us so many hurricanes. Those who have
decided to go through existence as an island are the most exposed
and the most ravaged by the storms and whirlwinds.
On September 11, 2001, Brian Sweeney was a passenger trapped
on hijacked United Airlines Flight 175, which was heading straight
for the South Tower of the World Trade Center. He called his wife
from one of the plane’s seatback phones to say that things were not
looking good. “I want you to know that I absolutely love you,” he told
her voicemail. “I want you to do good, have good times, same with
my parents. I’ll see you when you get here.”
Imagine the terror of that moment, yet when you hear his voice
coming through the phone, not a trace of fear. The same serene
calmness is found in the final letter written by Major Sullivan Ballou
in 1861 in the days before his Federal regiment marched out to
Manassas, Virginia, where he seemed to know for certain that he
would die in battle. “Sarah,” he wrote, “my love for you is deathless.
It seems to bind me with mighty cables, that nothing but
Omnipotence can break; and yet, my love of country comes over me
like a strong wind, and bears me irresistibly on with all those chains,
to the battlefield. The memories of all the blissful moments I have
spent with you come crowding over me, and I feel most deeply
grateful to God and you, that I have enjoyed them so long.”

Fyodor Dostoevsky once described his wife, Anna, as a rock on
which he could lean and rest, a wall that would not let him fall and
protected him from the cold. There is no better description of love,
between spouses or friends or parent and child, than that. Love,
Freud said, is the great educator. We learn when we give it. We learn
when we get it. We get closer to stillness through it.
Like all good education, it is not easy. Not easy at all.
It’s been said that the word “love” is spelled T-I-M-E. It is also
spelled W-O-R-K and S-A-C-R-I-F-I-C-E and D-I-F-F-I-C-U-L-T-Y,
C-O-M-M-I-T-M-E-N-T, and occasionally M-A-D-N-E-S-S.
But it is always punctuated by R-E-W-A-R-D. Even ones that end.
The stillness of two people on a porch swing, the stillness of a
hug, of a final letter, of a memory, a phone call before a plane crash,
of paying it forward, of teaching, of learning, of being together.
The notion that isolation, that total self-driven focus, will get you
to a supreme state of enlightenment is not only incorrect, it misses
the obvious: Who will even care that you did all that? Your house
might be quieter without kids and it might be easier to work longer
hours without someone waiting for you at the dinner table, but it is a
hollow quiet and an empty ease.
To go through our days looking out for no one but ourselves? To
think that we can or must do this all alone? To accrue mastery or
genius, wealth or power, solely for our own benefit? What is the
point?
By ourselves, we are a fraction of what we can be.
By ourselves, something is missing, and, worse, we feel that in
our bones.
Which is why stillness requires other people; indeed, it is for
other people.

CONQUER YOUR ANGER

He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and
he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
—PROVERBS 16:32

I

n 2009, Michael Jordan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of
Fame. It was the crowning achievement of a magnificent career
that included six NBA championships, fourteen trips to the All-Star
Game, two Olympic gold medals, and the highest scoring average in
the history of the sport.
Ascending the stage in a silver suit, with his trademark single
hoop earring, Michael was in tears from the start. He joked that his
initial plan had been to simply accept the honor, say thank you, and
then return to his seat. But he couldn’t do it.
He had something he wanted to say.
What ensued was a strange and surreal speech where Michael
Jordan, a man with nothing to prove and so much to be thankful for,
spent nearly a half hour listing and responding to every slight he’d
ever received in his career. Standing at the podium, in a tone that
feigned lightheartedness but was clearly deeply felt and deeply angry,
he complained of media naysayers, and of how his college coach at
North Carolina, Dean Smith, had not touted him as a promising
freshman in a 1981 interview with Sports Illustrated. He even noted
how much he spent on tickets for his children for the ceremony.
After a few sweet remarks about his family, Jordan pointed out a
man in the audience named Leroy Smith, the player who had gotten

Michael’s playing time some thirty-one years earlier. Jordan knew
that many people thought that his getting cut in high school was a
myth. “Leroy Smith was a guy when I got cut he made the team—on
the varsity team—and he’s here tonight,” Michael explained. “He’s
still the same six-foot-seven guy—he’s not any bigger—probably his
game is about the same. But he started the whole process with me,
because when he made the team and I didn’t, I wanted to prove not
just to Leroy Smith, not just to myself, but to the coach that picked
Leroy over me, I wanted to make sure you understood—you made a
mistake, dude.”
It’s a remarkable window into Michael’s mind, for several
reasons. First off, it shows how he had twisted a predictable decision
into a major slight about his self-worth. Jordan hadn’t been cut from
any team. He and Leroy had both tried out for a single spot on the
varsity team. One had made it. That’s not getting “cut”—it’s expected
that an underclassman won’t make the senior class team! Nor had it
even been a referendum on his abilities. Leroy was six foot seven.
Michael was five foot eleven at the time. It’s also so childishly selfabsorbed. As if Leroy and his coach weren’t their own people, a
teammate he could have been happy for, a mentor he could have
learned from.
Yet for decades Jordan had chosen to be mad about it.
It’s almost palpable how uncomfortable the audience grew as the
complaints grew increasingly personal and petty. At one point,
Michael mentioned a remark that Jerry Krause made in 1997,
supposedly saying that “organizations win championships,” not just
individual players. Sneering at this minor—but true—observation of
the Bulls’ general manager, Michael explained that he had
specifically not invited Krause to the ceremony in retaliation. He
mentioned with pride the time he kicked Pat Riley, the coach of the
Lakers, the Knicks, and later the Heat, out of a hotel suite in Hawaii
because he wanted to stay in it.
Friends understood that Michael had intended for the speech to
be helpful. Instead of uttering a few platitudes, he wanted to show
just what it was that created a winning mentality. How tough it was.
What it took. He wanted to illustrate how productive anger could be
—how as a player each time he was slighted, each time he was

underestimated, each time someone didn’t do things his way, it made
him a better player.
The problem is that he delivered almost the exact opposite
message.* Yes, he had shown that anger was powerful fuel. He had
also shown just how likely it is to blow up all over yourself and the
people around you.
There were undoubtedly moments in Jordan’s career when
resentment had worked to his advantage and made him play better.
It was also a form of madness that hurt him and his teammates (like
Steve Kerr and Bill Cartwright and Kwame Brown, whom he
physically fought or berated). It had cruelly wrecked the selfconfidence of competitors like Muggsy Bogues (“Shoot it, you fucking
midget,” he’d told his five-foot-three opponent while giving him a
free shot in the ’95 playoffs). In training camp in 1989, Jordan threw
a vicious elbow that knocked a rookie named Matt Brust
unconscious, and ended the man’s hopes of an NBA career.
Jordan’s game was beautiful, but his conduct was often savage
and ugly.
Was anger really the secret of Michael Jordan’s championships?
(Did his anger get him that varsity spot he wanted the next year . . .
or did growing four inches help?) Could it have actually been a
parasitic by-product that prevented him from enjoying what he
accomplished? (Tom Brady wins a lot without being mean or angry.)
If history is any indication, leaders, artists, generals, and athletes
who are driven primarily by anger not only tend to fail over a long
enough timeline, but they tend to be miserable even if they don’t. It
was without a hint of self-awareness that Nixon—who hated Ivy
Leaguers, hated reporters, hated Jews and so many other people—
said these high-minded words to his loyal staffers in his last hours in
the White House: “Always remember, others may hate you, but those
who hate you don’t win unless you hate them. And then you destroy
yourself.”
He was right. His own downfall proved it.
The leaders we truly respect, who stand head and shoulders
above the rest, have been motivated by more than anger or hate.
From Pericles to Martin Luther King Jr., we find that great leaders

are fueled by love. Country. Compassion. Destiny. Reconciliation.
Mastery. Idealism. Family.
Even in Jordan’s case, he was most inspiring not when he was
trying to dominate someone but when he was playing for the love of
the game. And his rings all came under the tutelage and coaching of
Phil Jackson, known in basketball as the “Zen Master.”
It would be unfair to say that Michael Jordan was as tortured or
pained as Richard Nixon, or that he was utterly without joy or
happiness. Still, the speech is striking. He had locked so much anger
and pain up in a closet in his soul that, at some point, the doors burst
open and the mess poured out.
Seneca’s argument was that anger ultimately blocks us from
whatever goal we are trying to achieve. While it might temporarily
help us achieve success in our chosen field, in the long run it is
destructive. How excellent is excellence if it doesn’t make us feel
content, happy, fulfilled? It’s a strange bargain that winning, as
Jordan illustrated, should require us to constantly think of the times
we were made to feel like a loser. The reward for becoming worldclass should not be that you are a walking open wound, a trigger
that’s pulled a thousand times a day.
And what of the people whose anger is more of a hot flash than a
slow burn? Seneca once more:
There is no more stupefying thing than anger, nothing
more bent on its own strength. If successful, none more
arrogant, if foiled, none more insane—since it’s not driven
back by weariness even in defeat, when fortune removes
its adversary it turns its teeth on itself.
Anger is counterproductive. The flash of rage here, an outburst at
the incompetence around us there—this may generate a moment of
raw motivation or even a feeling of relief, but we rarely tally up the
frustration they cause down the road. Even if we apologize or the
good we do outweighs the harm, damage remains—and
consequences follow. The person we yelled at is now an enemy. The
drawer we broke in a fit is now a constant annoyance. The high blood

pressure, the overworked heart, inching us closer to the attack that
will put us in the hospital or the grave.
We can pretend we didn’t hear or see things that were meant to
offend. We can move slowly, giving extreme emotions time to
dissipate. We can avoid situations and people (and even entire cities)
where we know we tend to get upset or pissed off. When we feel our
temper rising up, we need to look for insertion points (the space
between stimulus and response). Points where we can get up and
walk away. When we can say, “I am getting upset by this and I would
like not to lose my cool about it,” or “This doesn’t matter and I’m not
going to hold on to it.” We can think even of the Mr. Rogers verse
about anger:
It’s great to be able to stop
When you’ve planned a thing that’s wrong,
And be able to do something else instead
And think this song
As silly as those lyrics might seem to us in the moment, as our
temper is boiling over, are they any worse than a grown adult losing
their cool over some minor slight? Are they worse than saying or
doing something that will haunt us, possibly forever?
Not that regret minimization is the point of managing our
temper, although it is an important factor. The point is that people
who are driven by anger are not happy. They are not still. They get in
their own way. They shorten legacies and short-circuit their goals.
The Buddhists believed that anger was a kind of tiger within us,
one whose claws tear at the body that houses it. To have a chance at
stillness—and the clear thinking and big-picture view that defines it
—we need to tame that tiger before it kills us. We have to beware of
desire, but conquer anger, because anger hurts not just ourselves but
many other people as well. Although the Stoics are often criticized for
their rigid rules and discipline, that is really what they are after: an
inner dignity and propriety that protects them and their loved ones
from dangerous passions.

Clearly, basketball was a refuge for Michael Jordan, a game he
loved and that provided him much satisfaction. But in the pursuit of
winning and domination, he also turned it into a kind of raw, open
wound, one that seemed to never stop bleeding or cause pain. One
that likely cost him additional years of winning, as well as the simple
enjoyment of a special evening at the Hall of Fame in Springfield,
Massachusetts.
That can’t be what you want. That can’t be who you want to be.
Which is why we must choose to drive out anger and replace it
with love and gratitude—and purpose. Our stillness depends on our
ability to slow down and choose not to be angry, to run on different
fuel. Fuel that helps us win and build, and doesn’t hurt other people,
our cause, or our chance at peace.

ALL IS ONE

All that you behold, that which comprises both god and
man, is one—we are the parts of one great body.
—SENECA

I

n 1971, the astronaut Edgar Mitchell was launched into space.
From 239,000 miles up, he stared down at the tiny blue marble
that is our planet and felt something wash over him. It was, he said
later, “an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an
intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion
to do something about it.”
So far away, the squabbles of the earth suddenly seemed petty.
The differences between nations and races fell away, the false
urgency of trivial problems disappeared. What was left was a sense of
connectedness and compassion for everyone and everything.
All Mitchell could think of, when he looked at the planet from the
quiet, weightless cabin of his spaceship, was grabbing every selfish
politician by the neck and pulling them up there to point and say,
“Look at that, you son of a bitch.”
Not that he was angry. On the contrary, he was the calmest and
most serene he’d ever been. He wanted them—the leaders, the people
who are supposed to work on behalf of their fellow citizens—to have
the same realization he was having: the realization that we are all
one, that we are all in this together, and that this fact is the only
thing that truly matters.

The Christian word for this term is agape. It is the ecstasy of love
from a higher power, the sheer luck and good fortune of being made
in that image. If you’ve ever seen the Bernini statue of Saint Teresa,
you can get a sense of this feeling in the physical form. The caring
smile of an angel thrusting an arrow into Teresa’s heart. The rays of
golden sun shooting down from heaven. Teresa’s closed eyes and
partly opened mouth, realizing, knowing the depth of love and
connection that exists for her.
Whether it comes from the perspective of space, a religious
epiphany, or the silence of meditation, the understanding that we are
all connected—that we are all one—is a transformative experience.
Such quiet peace follows this . . . such stillness.
With it, we lose the selfishness and self-absorption at the root of
much of the disturbance in our lives.
The Greeks spoke of sympatheia, the kind of mutual
interdependence and relatedness of all things, past, present, and
future. They believed that each person on this planet had an
important role to play, and should be respected for it. John Cage
came to understand something similar as he embraced his own
quirky, unique style of music—like that four-minute-and-thirtythree-second song of silence—rather than trying to be like everyone
else. “That one sees that the human race as one person,” he wrote,
with each of us as an individual part of one single body, “enables him
to see that originality is necessary, for there is no need for eye to do
what hand does so well.”
The truly philosophical view is that not only is originality
necessary, but everyone is necessary. Even the people you don’t like.
Even the ones who really piss you off. Even the people wasting their
lives, cheating, or breaking the rules are part of the larger equation.
We can appreciate—or at least sympathize with—them, rather than
try to fight or change them.
Robert Greene, known for his amoral study of power and
seduction, actually writes in his book The Laws of Human Nature
about the need to practice mitfreude, the active wishing of goodwill
to other people, instead of schadenfreude, the active wishing of ill
will. We can make an active effort to practice forgiveness, especially
to those who might have caused those inner-child wounds we have

worked to heal. We can seek understanding with those we disagree
with. Tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner. To understand all is to
forgive all. To love all is to be at peace with all, including yourself.
Take something you care about deeply, a possession you cherish,
a person you love, or an experience that means a lot to you. Now take
that feeling, that radiating warmth that comes up when you think
about it, and consider how every single person, even murderers on
death row, even the jerk who just shoved you in the supermarket, has
that same feeling about something in their lives. Together, you share
that. Not only do you share it, but you share it with everyone who has
ever lived. It connects you to Cleopatra and Napoleon and Frederick
Douglass.
You can do the same with your pain. As bad as you might feel in a
given moment, this too is a shared feeling, a connection with others.
The man stepping outside to take a walk after an argument with his
spouse. The mother worrying about her child, the one who seems to
always be in trouble. The merchant stressing over where the money
will come from—How will I keep going? Two siblings grieving the
loss of a parent. The average citizen following the news, hoping their
country will avoid an unnecessary war.
No one is alone, in suffering or in joy. Down the street, across the
ocean, in another language, someone else is experiencing nearly the
exact same thing. It has always been and always will be thus.
You can even use this to connect more deeply with yourself and
your own life. The moon you’re looking at tonight is the same moon
you looked at as a scared young boy or girl, it’s the same you’ll look at
when you’re older—in moments of joy and in pain—and it’s the same
that your children will look at in their own moments and their own
lives.
When you step back from the enormity of your own immediate
experience—whatever it is—you are able to see the experience of
others and either connect with them or lessen the intensity of your
own pain. We are all strands in a long rope that stretches back
countless generations and ties together every person in every country
on every continent. We are all thinking and feeling the same things,
we are all made of and motivated by the same things. We are all
stardust. And no one needs this understanding more than the

ambitious or the creative, since they live so much in their own heads
and in their own bubble.
Finding the universal in the personal, and the personal in the
universal, is not only the secret to art and leadership and even
entrepreneurship, it is the secret to centering oneself. It both turns
down the volume of noise in the world and tunes one in to the quiet
wavelength of wisdom that sages and philosophers have long been
on.
This connectedness and universality does not need to stop at our
fellow man. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum recently pointed out
the narcissism of the human obsession with what it means to be
human. A better, more open, more vulnerable, more connected
question is to ask what it means to be alive, or to exist, period. As she
wrote:
We share a planet with billions of other sentient beings,
and they all have their own complex ways of being
whatever they are. All of our fellow animal creatures, as
Aristotle observed long ago, try to stay alive and reproduce
more of their kind. All of them perceive. All of them desire.
And most move from place to place to get what they want
and need.
We share much of our DNA with these creatures, we breathe the
same air, we walk on the same land and swim in the same oceans.
We are inextricably intertwined with each other—as are our fates.
The less we are convinced of our exceptionalism, the greater
ability we have to understand and contribute to our environment, the
less blindly driven we are by our own needs, the more clearly we can
appreciate the needs of those around us, the more we can appreciate
the larger ecosystem of which we are a part.
Peace is when we realize that victory and defeat are almost
identical spots on one long spectrum. Peace is what allows us to take
joy in the success of others and to let them take joy in our own. Peace
is what motivates a person to be good, to treat every other living

thing well, because they understand that it is a way to treat
themselves well.
We are one big collective organism engaged in one endless
project together. We are one.
We are the same.
Still, too often we forget it, and we forget ourselves in the process.

ON TO WHAT’S NEXT . . .

Very few go astray who comport themselves with
restraint.

L

’essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.
What’s essential is invisible to the eye.
The quote that hung on Fred Rogers’s wall was actually only a
partial quote. The rest appears in The Little Prince, the beautiful and
surreal children’s book by the French aviator and World War II hero
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. In it, the fox tells the little boy, “Here is
my secret. It is very simple: It is only with the heart that one can see
rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.”
First, we sought mental clarity. But quickly we realized that the
soul must be in equally good order if we wish to achieve stillness. In
concert with each other—clarity in the mind and in the soul—we find
both excellence and unbreakable tranquility. It is with the heart and
soul that we are able to surface important things that the eyes need
to see.
Examining our souls is not as easy as clearing our minds, you’ll
find. It requires that we peel back what the writer Mark Manson has
called the “self-awareness onion” and take responsibility for our own
emotions and impulses. Anyone who’s done it can tell you that tears
and onions often go together.
But it’s precisely this soft stuff—getting in touch with ourselves,
finding balance and meaning, cultivating virtue—that the volleyball

champion Kerri Walsh Jennings has said makes her such a killer on
the court.
Some ancient traditions have held that the soul is in the belly,
which is fitting for two reasons. Because we’ve just been through the
belly of the beast part of our journey, and because it sets up where
we go next.
Stillness isn’t merely an abstraction—something we only think
about or feel. It’s also real. It’s in our bodies. Seneca warned us not to
“suppose that the soul is at peace when the body is still.” Vice versa.
Lao Tzu said that “movement is the foundation of stillness.”
What follows then is the final domain of stillness. The literal form
that our form takes in the course of day-to-day life. Our bodies
(where, you must not forget, the heart and the brain are both
located). The environment we put those bodies in. The habits and
routines to which we subject that body.
A body that is overworked or abused is not only actually not still,
it creates turbulence that ripples through the rest of our lives. A mind
that is overtaxed and ill-treated is susceptible to vice and corruption.
A spoiled, lazy existence is the manifestation of spiritual emptiness.
We can be active, we can be on the move, and still be still. Indeed, we
have to be active for the stillness to have any meaning.
Life is hard. Fortune is fickle. We can’t afford to be weak. We
can’t afford to be fragile. We must strengthen our bodies as the
physical vessel for our minds and spirit, subject to the capriciousness
of the physical world.
Which is why we now move on to this final domain of stillness—
the body—and its place in the real world. In real life.

MIND ♦ SPIRIT ♦ BODY

We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is
our own flesh and blood and bones.
—HENRY DAVID THOREAU

THE DOMAIN OF THE BODY

W

inston Churchill had a productive life.
He first saw combat at age twenty-one, and wrote his first
bestselling book about it not long after. By twenty-six, he’d been
elected to public office and would serve in government for the next
six and half decades. He’d write some ten million words and over
forty books, paint more than five hundred paintings, and give some
twenty-three hundred speeches in the course of his time on this
planet. In between all that, he managed to hold the positions of
minister of defense, first lord of the admiralty, chancellor of the
exchequer, and of course, prime minister of Britain, where he helped
save the world from the Nazi menace. Then, to top it off, he spent his
twilight years fighting the totalitarian communist menace.
“It is a pushing age,” Churchill wrote his mother as a young man,
“and we must shove with the rest.” It may well be that Winston
Churchill was the greatest pusher in all of history. His life spanned
the final cavalry charge of the British Empire, which he witnessed as
a young war correspondent in 1898, and ended well into the nuclear
age, indeed the space age, both of which he helped usher in. His first
trip to America was on a steamship (to be introduced on stage by
Mark Twain, no less), and his final one on a Boeing 707 that flew at
500 miles per hour. In between he saw two world wars, the invention
of the car, radio, and rock and roll, and countless trials and
triumphs.
Is there stillness to be found here? Could someone that active, so
Herculean in their labors, who embraced so much strife and stress,
ever be described as still, or at peace?
Strangely, yes.

As Paul Johnson, one of Churchill’s best biographers, would
write, “The balance he maintained between flat-out work and
creative and restorative leisure is worth study by anyone holding a
top position.” Johnson as a seventeen-year-old, decades before his
own career as a writer, met Churchill on the street and shouted to
him, “Sir, to what do you attribute your success in life?”
Immediately, Churchill replied, “Conservation of energy. Never
stand up when you can sit down, and never sit down when you can
lie down.”
Churchill conserved his energy so that he never shirked from a
task, or backed down from a challenge. So that, for all this work and
pushing, he never burned himself out or snuffed out the spark of joy
that made life worth living. (Indeed, in addition to the importance of
hard work, Johnson said the other four lessons from Churchill’s
remarkable life were to aim high; to never allow mistakes or criticism
to get you down; to waste no energy on grudges, duplicity, or
infighting; and to make room for joy.) Even during the war, Churchill
never lost his sense of humor, never lost sight of what was beautiful
in the world, and never became jaded or cynical.
Different traditions offer different prescriptions for the good life.
The Stoics urged determination and iron self-will. The Epicureans
preached relaxation and simple pleasures. The Christians spoke of
saving mankind and glorifying God. The French, a certain joie de
vivre. The happiest and most resilient of us manage to incorporate a
little of each each of these approaches into our lives, and that was
certainly true of Churchill. He was a man of great discipline and
passion. He was a soldier. He was a lover of books, a believer in glory
and honor. A statesman, a literal bricklayer, and a painter. We are all
worms, he once joked to a friend, simple organisms that eat and
defecate and then die, but he liked to think of himself as a
glowworm.
In addition to his impressive mental abilities and spiritual
strength, Churchill was also an unexpected—given his portly frame—
master of the third and final domain of stillness, the physical one.
Few would have predicted he would distinguish himself here.
Born with a frail constitution, Churchill complained as a young man
that he was “cursed with so feeble a body that I can hardly support

the fatigues of the day.” Yet like Theodore Roosevelt before him, he
cultivated inside this frail body an indomitable soul and a
determined mind that overcame his physical limitations.
It’s a balance that everyone aspiring to sustained inner peace
must strike. Mens sana in corpore sano—a strong mind in a strong
body. Remember, when we say that someone “showed so much
heart,” we don’t mean emotion. We mean they had tenacity and grit.
The metaphor is actually misleading if you think about it. It’s really
the spine—the backbone of body—that’s doing the work.
Young Churchill loved the written word, but, diverging from the
traditional path of a writer, he didn’t lock himself up with books in a
dusty old library. He put his body into action. Serving in or observing
three straight wars, he made his name chronicling the exploits of the
empire, first as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer
War, where he was taken prisoner in 1899 and barely escaped with
his life.
In 1900, he was elected to his first political office. By age thirtythree, realizing that greatness was impossible alone, he committed
his body to another. He married his wife, Clementine, a brilliant,
calming influence who balanced out many of his worst traits. It was
one of the great marriages of the age—they called each other “Pug”
and “Cat”—marked by true affection and love. “My ability to
persuade my wife to marry me,” he said, was “quite my most brilliant
achievement. . . . Of course, it would have been impossible for any
ordinary man to have got through what I had to go through in peace
and war without the devoted aid of what we call, in England, one’s
better half.”
As busy and ambitious as Churchill was—as much of a pusher as
he was—he was rarely frantic and did not tolerate disorganization. It
almost ruins the fun to learn that Churchill’s infamous bons mots
and one-liners were in fact well-practiced and rehearsed. No one
knew the effort that went into them, he said, nor the effort that went
into making them look effortless. “Every night,” he said, “I try myself
by court martial to see if I have done anything effective during the
day. I don’t mean just pawing the ground—anyone can go through
the motions—but something really effective.”

As a writer, he was gaspingly productive. While holding political
office, Churchill managed to publish seven books between 1898 and
the end of World War I alone. How did he do it? How did he manage
to pull so much out of himself? The simple answer: physical routine.
Each morning, Churchill got up around eight and took his first
bath, which he entered at 98 degrees and had cranked up to 104
while he sat (and occasionally somersaulted) in the water. Freshly
bathed, he would spend the next two hours reading. Then he
responded to his daily mail, mostly pertaining to his political duties.
Around noon he’d stop in to say hello to his wife for the first time—
believing all his life that the secret to a happy marriage was that
spouses should not see each other before noon. Then he tackled
whatever writing project he was working on—likely an article or a
speech or a book. By early afternoon he would be writing at a
fantastic clip and then abruptly stop for lunch (which he would
finally dress for). After lunch, he would go for a walk around
Chartwell, his estate in the English countryside, feeding his swans
and fish—to him the most important and enjoyable part of the day.
Then he would sit on the porch and take in the air, thinking and
musing. For inspiration and serenity he might recite poetry to
himself. At 3 p.m., it was time for a two-hour nap. After the nap, it
was family time and then a second bath before a late, seated and
formal dinner (after 8 p.m.). After dinner and drinks, one more
writing sprint before bed.
It was a routine he would stick to even on Christmas.
Churchill was a hard worker and a man of discipline—but like us,
he was not perfect. He often worked more than he should have,
usually because he spent more money than he needed to (and it
produced a fair bit of writing that would have better remained
unpublished). Churchill was impetuous, liked to gamble, and was
prone to overcommit. It wasn’t from the tireless execution of his
wartime duties that he was inspired to depict himself once, in a
drawing, as a pig carrying a twenty-thousand-pound weight. It was
his indulgences that produced that.
Nor was his life an endless series of triumphs. Churchill made
many mistakes, usually lapses of judgment that came from a mind
fried by stress. Thus, he emerged from World War I with a mixed

record. His service in the wartime administration had been marked
by some major failures, but he had redeemed himself by resigning
and serving on the front lines with the Royal Scots Fusiliers. After
the war, he was called back to serve as secretary of state for war and
air and then secretary of state for the colonies.
The mid-1920s saw Churchill serving as chancellor of the
exchequer (a position in which he was in way over his head), while
having also signed a contract to produce a six-volume, threethousand-page account of the war, titled The World Crisis. Left to his
own devices, he might have tried to white-knuckle this incredible
workload. But those around him saw the toll that his responsibilities
were taking and, worried about burnout, urged him to find a hobby
that might offer him a modicum of pleasure and enjoyment and rest.
“Do remember what I said about resting from current problems,”
Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin wrote to him. “A big year will soon
begin and much depends on your keeping fit.”
In typical Churchillian fashion, he chose an unexpected form of
leisure: bricklaying. Taught the craft by two employees at Chartwell,
he immediately fell in love with the slow, methodical process of
mixing mortar, troweling, and stacking bricks. Unlike his other
professions, writing and politics, bricklaying didn’t wear down his
body, it invigorated him. Churchill could lay as many as ninety bricks
an hour. As he wrote to the prime minister in 1927, “I have had a
delightful month building a cottage and dictating a book: 200 bricks
and 2000 words a day.” (He also spent several hours a day on his
ministerial duties.) A friend observed how good it was for Churchill
to get down on the ground and interact with the earth. This was also
precious time he spent with his youngest daughter, Sarah, who
dutifully carried the bricks for her father as his cute and well-loved
apprentice.
A dark moment in World War I had inspired another hobby—oil
painting. He was introduced to it by his sister-in-law, who, sensing
that Churchill was a steaming kettle of stress, handed him a small kit
of paints and brushes her young children liked to play with. In a little
book titled Painting as a Pastime, Churchill spoke eloquently of a
reliance on new activities that use other parts of our minds and
bodies to relieve the areas where we are overworked. “The cultivation

of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of first
importance to a public man,” he wrote. “To be really happy and really
safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must
all be real.”
Churchill was not a particularly good painter (his bricklaying was
often corrected by professionals too), but even a glance at his
pictures reveals how much he enjoyed himself as he worked. It’s
palpable in the brushstrokes. “Just to paint is great fun,” he would
say. “The colors are lovely to look at and delicious to squeeze out.”
Early on, Churchill was advised by a well-known painter never to
hesitate in front of the canvas (that is to say, overthink), and he took
it to heart. He wasn’t intimidated or discouraged by his lack of skill
(only this could explain the audacity it took for him to add a mouse
to a priceless Peter Paul Rubens painting that hung in one of the
prime minister’s residences). Painting was about expression of joy
for Churchill. It was leisure, not work.
Painting, like all good hobbies, taught the practitioner to be
present. “This heightened sense of observation of Nature,” he wrote,
“is one of the chief delights that have come to me through trying to
paint.” He had lived for forty years on planet Earth consumed by his
work and his ambition, but through painting, his perspective and
perception grew much sharper. Forced to slow down to set up his
easel, to mix his paints, to wait for them to dry, he saw things he
would have previously blown right past.
This was a skill that he actively cultivated—increasing his mental
awareness by way of physical exercises. Churchill started going to
museums to look at paintings, then he’d wait a day and try to recreate them from memory. Or he’d try to capture a landscape he had
seen after he had left it. (This was similar to his habit of reciting
poetry aloud.) “Painting challenged his intellect, appealed to his
sense of beauty and proportion, unleashed his creative impulse,
and . . . brought him peace,” remarked his lifelong friend Violet
Bonham Carter. It was also, she said, the only thing Churchill ever
did silently. His other daughter, Mary, observed that painting and
manual labor “were the sovereign antidotes to the depressive
element in his nature.” Churchill was happy because he got out of his
own head and put his body to work.

How necessary this turned out to be, because in 1929 his
stunning political career suddenly came to what appeared to be an
ignominious end. Driven from political life, Churchill spent a decade
in pseudo-exile at Chartwell, while Neville Chamberlain and a
generation of British politicians appeased the growing threat of
Fascism in Europe.
Life does that to us. It kicks our ass. Everything we work for can
be taken away. All our powers can be rendered impotent in a
moment. What follows this is not just an issue of spirit or the mind,
it’s a real physical question: What do you do with your time? How
do you handle the stress of the whiplash?
Marcus Aurelius’s answer was that in these situations one must
“love the discipline you know and let it support you.” In 1915, reeling
from the failure of the Gallipoli campaign, Churchill wrote of feeling
like a “sea-beast fished up from the depths, or a diver too suddenly
hoisted, my veins threatened to burst from the fall in pressure. I had
great anxiety and no means of relieving it; I had vehement
convictions and small power to give effect to them.” It was then that
he picked up painting, and in 1929, experiencing a similar loss in
cabin pressure, he returned to his discipline and his hobbies for relief
and for reflection.
Churchill didn’t know it in the middle of the 1930s, but being out
of power during Germany’s rearmament was exactly the right place
to be. It would take real strength to stay there, to not fight his way
back in, but if he had, he would have been sullied by the
incompetence of his peers in the government. Churchill was likely
one of the only British leaders to take the time to sit through and
digest Hitler’s Mein Kampf (if Chamberlain had, perhaps Hitler
could have been stopped sooner). This time allowed Churchill to
actively pursue his writing and radio careers, which made him a
beloved celebrity in America (and primed the country for its eventual
alliance with Britain). He spent time with his goldfish and his
children and his oils.
Also, he had to wait. For the first time in his life, excepting those
afternoons on the porch, he had to do nothing.
Would Churchill have been the outsider called back to lead
Britain in its finest hour had he allowed the indignity of his political

exile to overwhelm his mind, burrow into his soul, and compel him
to fight his way back into the limelight in those years? Could he have
had the energy and strength at age sixty-six to put the country on his
back and lead without that supposedly “lost” decade? If he had kept
up his breakneck pace?
Almost certainly not.
Churchill himself would write that every prophet must be forced
into the wilderness—where they undergo solitude, deprivation,
reflection, and meditation. It’s from this physical ordeal he said that
“psychic dynamite” is made. When Churchill was recalled, he was
ready. He was rested. He could see what no one else could or would.
Everyone else cowered in fear of Hitler, but Churchill did not.
Instead, he fought. He stood alone. As he said to the House of
Commons:
Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and
famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the
Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall
not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in
France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall
fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the
air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be,
we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing
grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we
shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even
if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a
large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our
Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British
Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good
time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps
forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.
Churchill demanded equal courage from those in his own house.
When asked by his daughter-in-law what they could possibly do if
the Germans invaded Britain, he growled and replied, “You can

always get a carving knife from the kitchen and take one with you,
can’t you?”
The British Empire had been responsible for despicable human
rights violations, but Churchill knew irredeemable evil when he saw
it, and its name was Nazism. Concentration camps and genocidal
extermination still lay off in the future, but Churchill saw that no
self-respecting leader, no country of virtue could make a deal with
Hitler. Even if that was easier. Even if it might have protected Britain
from invasion. At the same time, he was careful to manage the
passions that war stirs up. “I hate nobody except Hitler,” he said
“and that is professional.”
Churchill was an indefatigable workhorse from the day Britain
declared war on Germany in 1939 until the end of the war in mid1945. During the war, Clementine designed a special suit her
husband could wear and sleep in. They were called his “siren suits”—
though the British public endearingly referred to them as his
“rompers”—and they saved him precious minutes getting dressed,
allowing him to grab much-needed naps.
So, yes, he was out of balance in those years, working 110-hour
weeks, and hardly ever still. It has been estimated that he traveled
110,000 miles by air and sea and car between 1940 and 1943 alone.
During the war, it was said that Churchill kept “less schedule than a
forest fire and had less peace than a hurricane.” But then again, he’d
rested up for precisely this moment—and when it was an option, he
did maintain his routine, even when he was living like a gopher in the
underground bunker that was the Cabinet War Rooms. He didn’t
have much time for painting during the war—nor many chances to be
out in nature—but when he could he did. (One is a beautiful painting
of a North African sunset, which he drove an extra five hours to
capture after the major war powers met at Casablanca.)
It is unlikely that any single individual has ever done more to save
or advance the notions sacred to Eastern or Western civilization. And
how was Churchill rewarded for these labors, for all that he had
done?
In 1945, he was pushed out of office. Upon hearing the news,
Clementine attempted to console him by saying, “Perhaps this is a

blessing in disguise.” “It must be very well-disguised,” Churchill
replied. He was wrong. She was right. As usual.
Not only because it allowed Churchill to write his final set of
memoirs, The Second World War, which firmly established and
taught the lessons that have prevented the world from veering
toward suicide since, but because it allowed him once again to rest
up and balance himself. We can see photos of him painting in
Marrakech in 1948, in the south of France in the 1950s. In all he
would paint some 550 paintings in his lifetime, 145 of them after the
war.
It was, in the end, a life of much struggle and sacrifice, a lot of it
thankless and misunderstood. It was productive, but at a high
personal cost. The same tasks and responsibilities would have
burned out and burned through a dozen normal people.
“Was it worth it?” a wearied hero had asked in Churchill’s only
novel. “The struggle, the labor, the constant rush of affairs, the
sacrifice of so many things that make life easy, or pleasant—for
what?” He wrote that when he was young, when he had been busy
and ambitious, and but not yet truly engaged in public service. In the
future lay fifty-five years in Parliament, thirty-one years as a
minister, and nine years as prime minister. The years ahead would
show him the true meaning of life and what it meant to really fight
for causes that mattered. He experienced both triumph and disaster.
And by the end of his life, he came to know that it was all worth it—
and certainly all of us alive today are grateful for those labors.
Indeed, Churchill’s last words were confirmation of this fact:
The journey has been enjoyable and well worth making—
once!
Epicurus once said that the wise will accomplish three things in
their life: leave written works behind them, be financially prudent
and provide for the future, and cherish country living. That is to say,
we will be reflective, we will be responsible and moderate, and we
will find time to relax in nature. It cannot be said that Churchill did

not do these things well (even granting that he did live it up when he
could afford to).
We compare this description to the three words Aristotle used to
describe the lives of slaves in his time: “Work, punishment, and
food.”
Which of these are we closer to in the modern world? Which of
these is the path to happiness and stillness?
No one can afford to neglect the final domain in our journey to
stillness. What we do with our bodies. What we put in our bodies.
Where we dwell. What kind of routine and schedule we keep. How
we find leisure and relief from the pressures of life.
If we are to be half as productive as Churchill, and manage to
capture the same joy and zest and stillness that defined his life, there
are traits we will need to cultivate. Each of us will need to:
Rise above our physical limitations.
Find hobbies that rest and replenish us.
Develop a reliable, disciplined routine.
Spend time getting active outdoors.
Seek out solitude and perspective.
Learn to sit—to do nothing when called for.
Get enough sleep and rein in our workaholism.
Commit to causes bigger than ourselves.
As they say, the body keeps score. If we don’t take care of
ourselves physically, if we don’t align ourselves properly, it doesn’t
matter how strong we are mentally or spiritually.
This will take effort. Because we will not simply think our way to
peace. We can’t pray our soul into better condition. We’ve got to
move and live our way there. It will take our body—our habits, our
actions, our rituals, our self-care—to get our mind and our spirit in
the right place, just as it takes our mind and spirit to get our body to
the right place.
It’s a trinity. A holy one. Each part dependent on the others.

SAY NO

The advantages of nonaction.
Few in the world attain these.
—THE DAODEJING

W

hen Fabius was dispatched to lead the Roman legions against
Hannibal, he did nothing. He did not attack. He did not race
out to drive the terrifying invader out of Italy and back to Africa.
You might think this was a sign of weakness—certainly most of
Rome did—but in fact, it was all part of Fabius’s strategy. Hannibal
was far from home, he was losing men to the elements and could not
easily replace them. Fabius believed that if Rome just held out and
did not engage in any costly battles, they would win.
But the mob couldn’t handle that kind of deliberate restraint.
We’re the strongest army in the world, his critics said. We don’t sit
around doing nothing when someone tries to attack us! So while
Fabius was away attending a religious ceremony, they pressured his
commander Minucius to attack.
It did not go well. He ran straight into a trap. Fabius had to rush
to his rescue. And even then, Minucius was hailed as a hero for doing
something, while Fabius was labeled a coward for holding himself
back. When his term ended, the Roman assemblies voted to abandon
what is now known as a “Fabian strategy” of mostly avoiding battle
and wearing Hannibal down, in favor of greater aggression and more
action.

It didn’t work. Only after the bloodbath at the Battle of Cannae, in
which the Romans attacked Hannibal and lost nearly their entire
army in a horrific rout, did people finally begin to understand
Fabius’s wisdom. Now they could see that what had looked like an
excess of caution was in fact a brilliant method of warfare. He had
been buying time and giving his opponent a chance to destroy
himself. Only now—and not a moment too soon—were they ready to
listen to him.
While most great Romans were given honorific titles that
highlighted their great victories or accomplishments in foreign lands,
Fabius was later given one that stands out: Fabius Cunctator.
The Delayer.
He was special for what he didn’t do—for what he waited to do—
and has stood as an important example to all leaders since.
Especially the ones feeling pressure from themselves or their
followers to be bold or take immediate action.
In baseball, you make a name for yourself by swinging for the
fences. Particularly for players from small, poor countries, showing
your power as a home run hitter is how you get noticed by scouts and
coaches. As they say in the Dominican Republic, “You don’t walk off
the island.” Meaning, you hit your way off.
It’s like life. You can’t benefit from opportunities you don’t try to
take advantage of.
But Dr. Jonathan Fader, an elite sports psychologist who has
spent nearly a decade with the New York Mets, has talked about just
how problematic this lesson is for rookie players in the majors. They
built their reputations, and therefore their identities, on swinging at
every pitch they thought they could hit . . . and now they’re facing the
best pitchers in the world. Suddenly, aggression is a weakness, not a
strength. Now they have to get up there in front of millions of people,
getting paid millions of dollars, and mostly not swing the bat. They
have to wait for the perfect pitch.
What they have to learn, what the great hitter Sadaharu Oh
himself learned in a series of complicated batting exercises designed
by his Zen master and hitting coach, Hiroshi Arakawa, was the power
of waiting, the power of precision, the power of the void. Because
that’s what makes for a real pro. A truly great hitter—not just a

swinger—needs quick hands and powerful hips, to be sure, but they
must also possess the power of wu wei, or nonaction.
Wu wei is the ability to hold the bat back—waiting until the batter
sees the perfect pitch. It is the yogi in meditation. They’re physically
still, so that they can be active on a mental and spiritual level. That
was also Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It might have
seemed like he wasn’t doing enough—that he wasn’t rushing to
destroy his opponent—but he was rightly carving out the space and
time to think, and time and space for the Russians to do the same
thing. Practicing wu wei was precisely what Tiger Woods lost the
ability to do as his work and sex addictions took control.
A disciplined action, that’s what John Cage called doing nothing
in the performance instructions on 4′33″.
You don’t solve a maze by rushing through. You have to stop and
think. You have to walk slowly and carefully, reining in your energy—
otherwise you’ll get hopelessly lost. The same is true for the problems
we face in life.
The green light is a powerful symbol in our culture. We forget
what Mr. Rogers was trying to make us see—that the yellow light and
the red light are just as important. Slow down. Stop. One recent
study found that subjects would rather give themselves an electric
shock than experience boredom for even a few minutes. Then we
wonder why people do so many stupid things.
There is a haunting clip of Joan Rivers, well into her seventies,
already one of the most accomplished and respected and talented
comedians of all time, in which she is asked why she keeps working,
why she is always on the road, always looking for more gigs. Telling
the interviewer about the fear that drives her, she holds up an empty
calendar. “If my book ever looked like this, it would mean that
nobody wants me, that everything I ever tried to do in life didn’t
work. Nobody cared and I’ve been totally forgotten.”
It’s not just that there was never enough for Joan. It’s that our
best and most lasting work comes from when we take things slow.
When we pick our shots and wait for the right pitches.
Somebody who thinks they’re nothing and don’t matter because
they’re not doing something for even a few days is depriving

themselves of stillness, yes—but they are also closing themselves off
from a higher plane of performance that comes out of it.
Spiritually, that’s hard. Physically, it’s harder still. You have to
make yourself say no. You have to make yourself not take the stage.
A weaker Fabius would not have been able to resist attacking
Hannibal, and all of history might have turned out differently. A
long-distance runner who can’t pace himself. A money manager who
can’t wait out a bear market. If they can’t learn the art of wu wei in
their professions, they won’t succeed. If you can’t do it in your life,
forget about success, you’ll burn out your body. And you don’t get
another one of those!
We should look fearfully, even sympathetically, at the people who
have become slaves to their calendars, who require a staff of ten to
handle all their ongoing projects, whose lives seem to resemble a
fugitive fleeing one scene for the next. There is no stillness there. It’s
servitude.
Each of us needs to get better at saying no. As in, “No, sorry, I’m
not available.” “No, sorry, that sounds great but I’d rather not.” “No,
I’m going to wait and see.” “No, I don’t like that idea.” “No, I don’t
need that—I’m going to make the most of what I have.” “No, because
if I said yes to you, I’d have to say yes to everyone.”
Maybe it’s not the most virtuous thing to say “No, sorry, I can’t”
when you really can but just don’t want to. But can you really? Can
you really afford to do it? And does it not harm other people if you’re
constantly stretched too thin?
A pilot gets to say, “Sorry, I’m on standby,” as an excuse to get out
of things. Doctors and firemen and police officers get to use being
“on call” as a shield. But are we not on call in our own lives? Isn’t
there something (or someone) that we’re preserving our full
capacities for? Are our own bodies not on call for our families, for
our self-improvement, for our own work?
Always think about what you’re really being asked to give.
Because the answer is often a piece of your life, usually in exchange
for something you don’t even want. Remember, that’s what time is.
It’s your life, it’s your flesh and blood, that you can never get back.
In every situation ask:

What is it?
Why does it matter?
Do I need it?
Do I want it?
What are the hidden costs?
Will I look back from the distant future and be glad I did it?
If I never knew about it at all—if the request was lost in the mail,
if they hadn’t been able to pin me down to ask me—would I
even notice that I missed out?
When we know what to say no to, we can say yes to the things
that matter.

TAKE A WALK

It is only ideas gained from walking that have any
worth.
—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

N

early every afternoon the citizens of Copenhagen were treated to
the strange sight of Søren Kierkegaard walking the streets. The
cantankerous philosopher would write in the morning at a standing
desk, and then around noon would head out onto the busy streets of
the city.
He walked on the newfangled “sidewalks” that had been built for
fashionable citizens to stroll along. He walked through the city’s
parks and along the pathways of Assistens Cemetery, where he would
later be buried. On occasion, he walked out past the city’s walls and
into the countryside. Kierkegaard never seemed to walk straight—he
zigged and zagged, crossing the street without notice, trying to
always remain in the shade. When he had either worn himself out,
worked through what he was struggling with, or been struck with a
good idea, he would turn around and make for home, where he
would write for the rest of the day.
Seeing Kierkegaard out walking surprised the residents of
Copenhagen, because he seemed, at least from his writings, to be
such a high-strung individual. They weren’t wrong. Walking was how
he released the stress and frustration that his philosophical
explorations inevitably created.

In a beautiful letter to his sister-in-law, who was often bedridden,
and depressed as a result, Kierkegaard wrote of the importance of
walking. “Above all,” he told her in 1847, “do not lose your desire to
walk: Every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk
away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts,
and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away
from it.”
Kierkegaard believed that sitting still was a kind of breeding
ground for illness. But walking, movement, to him was almost
sacred. It cleansed the soul and cleared the mind in a way that
primed his explorations as a philosopher. Life is a path, he liked to
say, we have to walk it.
And while Kierkegaard was particularly eloquent in his writing
about walking, he was by no means alone in his dedication to the
practice—nor alone in reaping the benefits. Nietzsche said that the
ideas in Thus Spoke Zarathustra came to him on a long walk. Nikola
Tesla discovered the rotating magnetic field, one of the most
important scientific discoveries of all time, on a walk through a city
park in Budapest in 1882. When he lived in Paris, Ernest Hemingway
would take long walks along the quais whenever he was stuck in his
writing and needed to clarify his thinking. Charles Darwin’s daily
schedule included several walks, as did those of Steve Jobs and the
groundbreaking psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman,
the latter of whom wrote that “I did the best thinking of my life on
leisurely walks with Amos.” It was the physical activity in the body,
Kahneman said, that got his brain going.
When Martin Luther King Jr. was a seminary student at Crozer,
he took an hour walk each day through the campus woods to
“commune with nature.” Walt Whitman and Ulysses S. Grant often
bumped into each other on their respective walks around
Washington, which cleared their minds and helped them think.
Perhaps it was that experience that Whitman was writing about in
this verse of “Song of Myself”:
Know’st thou the joys of pensive thought?
Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?

Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow’d yet proud, the
suffering and the struggle?
Freud was known for his speedy walks around Vienna’s
Ringstrasse after his evening meal. The composer Gustav Mahler
spent as much as four hours a day walking, using this time to work
through and jot down ideas. Ludwig van Beethoven carried sheet
music and a writing utensil with him on his walks for the same
reason. Dorothy Day was a lifelong walker, and it was on her strolls
along the beach on Staten Island in the 1920s that she first began to
feel a strong sense of God in her life and the first flickerings of the
awakening that would put her on a path toward sainthood. It’s
probably not a coincidence that Jesus himself was a walker—a
traveler—who knew the pleasures and the divineness of putting one
foot in front of the other.
How does walking get us closer to stillness? Isn’t the whole point
of what we’re talking about to reduce activity, not seek it out? Yes, we
are in motion when we walk, but it is not frenzied motion or even
conscious motion—it is repetitive, ritualized motion. It is deliberate.
It is an exercise in peace.
The Buddhists talk of “walking meditation,” or kinhin, where the
movement after a long session of sitting, particularly movement
through a beautiful setting, can unlock a different kind of stillness
than traditional meditation. Indeed, forest bathing—and most
natural beauty—can only be accomplished by getting out of your
house or office or car and trekking out into the woods on foot.
The key to a good walk is to be aware. To be present and open to
the experience. Put your phone away. Put the pressing problems of
your life away, or rather let them melt away as you move. Look down
at your feet. What are they doing? Notice how effortlessly they move.
Is it you who’s doing that? Or do they just sort of move on their own?
Listen to the sound of the leaves crunching underfoot. Feel the
ground pushing back against you.
Breathe in. Breathe out. Consider who might have walked this
very spot in the centuries before you. Consider the person who paved
the asphalt you are standing on. What was going on with them?

Where are they now? What did they believe? What problems did they
have?
When you feel the tug of your responsibilities or the desire to
check in with the outside world, push yourself a bit further. If you’re
on a path you have trod before, take a sudden turn down a street or
up a hill where you haven’t been before. Feel the unfamiliarity and
the newness of these surroundings, drink in what you have not yet
tasted.
Get lost. Be unreachable. Go slowly.
It’s an affordable luxury available to us all. Even the poorest
pauper can go for a nice walk—in a national park or an empty
parking lot.
This isn’t about burning calories or getting your heart rate up. On
the contrary, it’s not about anything. It is instead just a
manifestation, an embodiment of the concepts of presence, of
detachment, of emptying the mind, of noticing and appreciating the
beauty of the world around you. Walk away from the thoughts that
need to be walked away from; walk toward the ones that have now
appeared.
On a good walk, the mind is not completely blank. It can’t be—
otherwise you might trip over a root or get hit by a car or a bicyclist.
The point is not, as in traditional meditation, to push every thought
or observation from your mind. On the contrary, the whole point is
to see what’s around you. The mind might be active while you do
this, but it is still. It’s a different kind of thinking, a healthier kind if
you do it right. A study at New Mexico Highlands University has
found that the force from our footsteps can increase the supply of
blood to the brain. Researchers at Stanford have found that walkers
perform better on tests that measure “creative divergent thinking”
during and after their walks. A study out of Duke University found a
version of what Kierkegaard tried to tell his sister-in-law, that
walking could be as effective a treatment for major depression in
some patients as medication.
The poet William Wordsworth walked as many as 180,000 miles
in his lifetime—an average of six and a half miles a day since he was
five years old! He did much of his writing while walking, usually
around Grasmere, a lake in the English countryside, or Rydal Water,

which is not far from Grasmere. On these long walks, as lines of
poetry came to him, Wordsworth would repeat them over and over
again, since it might be hours until he had the chance to write them
down. Biographers have wondered ever since: Was it the scenery that
inspired the images of his poems or was it the movement that jogged
the thoughts? Every ordinary person who has ever had a
breakthrough on a walk knows that the two forces are equally and
magically responsible.
In our own search for beauty and what is good in life, we would
do well to head outside and wander around. In an attempt to unlock
a deeper part of our consciousness and access a high level of our
mind, we would do well to get our body moving and our blood
flowing.
Stress and difficulty can knock us down. Sitting at our computers,
we are overwhelmed with information, with emails, with one thing
after another. Should we just sit there and absorb it? Should we sit
there with the sickness and let it fester? No. Should we get up and
throw ourselves into some other project—constructive, like cleaning,
or cathartic, like picking a fight? No. We shouldn’t do any of that.
We should get walking.
Kierkegaard tells the story of a morning when he was driven from
his house in a state of despair and frustration—illness, in his words.
After an hour and a half, he was finally at peace and nearly back
home when he bumped into a friendly gentleman who chattered on
about a number of his problems. Isn’t that how it always seems to
go?
No matter. “There was only one thing left for me to do,”
Kierkegaard wrote, “instead of going home, to go walking again.”
And so must we.
Walk.
Then walk some more.

BUILD A ROUTINE

If a person puts even one measure of effort into
following ritual and the standards of righteousness, he
will get back twice as much.
—XUNZI

E

ach and every morning, Fred Rogers woke up at 5 a.m. to spend a
quiet hour in reflection and prayer. Then he would head to the
Pittsburgh Athletic Club, where he would swim his morning laps. As
he walked out to the pool he would weigh himself—it was important
that he always weigh 143 pounds—and as he jumped in, he would
sing “Jubilate Deo” to himself. He emerged from that pool as if
baptized anew each day, a friend wrote, fresh and fully prepared for
the workday ahead.
When he got to the set of his television show, the next part of the
ritual began, one that was recorded for posterity in identical fashion
over hundreds of episodes, year after year. The theme song starts.
The yellow light flashes. The camera pans to the front door. Mr.
Rogers enters, singing, and walks down the stairs. He takes off his
jacket and neatly hangs it up in the closet. He puts on and zips up his
trademark cardigan—the one his mother made him. Then he takes
off his shoes and puts on a comfortable pair of boat slippers. Now,
and only now, can he begin to speak and teach to his favorite people
in the world—the children of his neighborhood.
To some, this might seem monotonous. The same routine, day in
and day out, that extended beyond “Cut!” at the end of each show to

an afternoon nap, dinner with his family, and a 9:30 bedtime. The
same weight. The same food. The same introduction. The same close
to the day. Boring? The truth is that a good routine is not only a
source of great comfort and stability, it’s the platform from which
stimulating and fulfilling work is possible.
Routine, done for long enough and done sincerely enough,
becomes more than routine. It becomes ritual—it becomes sanctified
and holy.
Maybe Mr. Rogers isn’t your thing. Perhaps, then, you’d rather
look at the perennial all-star point guard Russell Westbrook, who
begins his own routine exactly three hours before tipoff. First, he
warms up. Then, one hour before the game, Westbrook visits the
arena chapel. Then he eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
(always buttered wheat bread, toasted, strawberry jelly, Skippy
peanut butter, cut diagonally). At exactly six minutes and seventeen
seconds before the game starts, he begins the team’s final warm-up
drill. He has a particular pair of shoes for games, for practice, for
road games. Since high school, he’s done the same thing after
shooting a free throw, walking backward past the three-point line
and then forward again to take the next shot. At the practice facility,
he has a specific parking space, and he likes to shoot on Practice
Court 3. He calls his parents at the same time every day. And on and
on.
Sports is filled with stories like Westbrook’s. They often feature
goalies in hockey, pitchers in baseball, quarterbacks and placekickers
in football—the most cerebral positions in their respective games.
Players who engage in this kind of behavior are called quirky, and
their routines are called superstitions. It’s strange to us that these
successful people, who are more or less their own boss and are
clearly so talented, seem prisoners to the regimentation of their
routines. Isn’t the whole point of greatness that you’re freed from
trivial rules and regulations? That you can do whatever you want?
Ah, but the greats know that complete freedom is a nightmare.
They know that order is a prerequisite of excellence and that in an
unpredictable world, good habits are a safe haven of certainty.
It was Eisenhower who defined freedom as the opportunity for
self-discipline. In fact, freedom and power and success require self-

discipline. Because without it, chaos and complacency move in.
Discipline, then, is how we maintain that freedom.
It’s also how we get in the right headspace to do our work. The
writer and runner Haruki Murakami talks about why he follows the
same routine every day. “The repetition itself becomes the important
thing,” he says, “it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to
reach a deeper state of mind.”
When our thoughts are empty and our body is in its groove, we do
our best work.
A routine can be time-based. Jack Dorsey, the founder and CEO
of Twitter, gets up at 5 a.m., without fail. The former Navy SEAL
Jocko Willink gets up at 4:30 a.m. and posts a picture of his watch to
prove it each morning. Queen Victoria woke at 8 a.m., ate breakfast
at 10, and met with her ministers from 11 to 11:30. The poet John
Milton was up at 4 a.m. to read and contemplate, so that by 7 a.m. he
was ready to be “milked” by his writing.
A routine can be focused on order or arrangement. Confucius
insisted that his mat be straight or he would not sit. Jim
Schlossnagle, the baseball coach who took over TCU’s team after a
long run of mediocre play, taught his players to keep their lockers, as
well as the dugout, spotless and orderly at all times (the team has
never had a losing season since and made it to four straight College
World Series). The ordering also matters to tennis great Rafael
Nadal, who drinks water and a recovery drink in the same order and
then sets them in a perfect arrangement.
Routine can be built around a tool or a sound or a scent. Rilke
had two pens and two kinds of paper on his desk; one was used for
writing, while the other was acceptable for bills, letters, and less
important documents. Monks are called to meditation by the
chiming of a monastery bell; other monks rub a zuko incense on their
hands before ceremonies and meditations.
A routine can also be religious or faith-based. Confucius always
gave a sacrificial offering before eating, no matter how
inconsequential the meal was. The Greeks consulted the Delphic
oracle before any major decision and made sacrifices before battle.
The Jews have kept the Sabbath for thousands of years, Abad Ha’am
once said, just as the Sabbath has kept the Jews.

Done enough times, done with sincerity and feeling, routine
becomes ritual. The regularity of it—the daily cadence—creates deep
and meaningful experience. To one person, taking care of a horse is a
chore. To Simón Bolívar it was a sacred, essential part of his day.
When the body is busy with the familiar, the mind can relax. The
monotony becomes muscle memory. To deviate seems dangerous,
wrong. As if it’s inviting failure in.
Some might sneer at this “superstitious” behavior, but that is the
wrong way to think about it. As Rafael Nadal explained, “If it were
superstition, why would I keep doing the same thing over and over
whether I win or lose? It’s a way of placing myself in a match,
ordering my surroundings to match the order I seek in my head.” Did
the Greeks really believe that the oracle of Delphi could tell them
what they should do? Or was the consultation process, the journey to
Mount Parnassus, the whole point?
Sociologists found that island tribes were more prone to create
rituals for activities where luck was a factor than where it wasn’t,
such as fishing on the open sea compared to on a lagoon. The truth
is, luck is always in play for us. Luck is always a factor.
The purpose of ritual isn’t to win the gods over to our side
(though that can’t hurt!). It’s to settle our bodies (and our minds)
down when Fortune is our opponent on the other side of the net.
Most people wake up to face the day as an endless barrage of
bewildering and overwhelming choices, one right after another.
What do I wear? What should I eat? What should I do first? What
should I do after that? What sort of work should I do? Should I
scramble to address this problem or rush to put out this fire?
Needless to say, this is exhausting. It is a whirlwind of conflicting
impulses, incentives, inclinations, and external interruptions. It is no
path to stillness and hardly a way to get the best out of yourself.
The psychologist William James spoke about making habits our
ally instead of our enemy. That we can build around us a day and a
life that is moral and ordered and still—and in so doing, create a kind
of bulwark against the chaos of the world and free up the best of
ourselves for the work we do.

For this, we must make automatic and habitual, as early as
possible, as many useful actions as we can, and guard
against the growing into ways that are likely to be
disadvantageous to us, as we should guard against the
plague. The more of the details of our daily life we can
hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the
more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their
own proper work. There is no more miserable human
being than one in whom nothing is habitual but
indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the
drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed
every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are
subjects of express volitional deliberation.
When we not only automate and routinize the trivial parts of life,
but also make automatic good and virtuous decisions, we free up
resources to do important and meaningful exploration. We buy room
for peace and stillness, and thus make good work and good thoughts
accessible and inevitable.
To make that possible, you must go now and get your house in
order. Get your day scheduled. Limit the interruptions. Limit the
number of choices you need to make.
If you can do this, passion and disturbance will give you less
trouble. Because it will find itself boxed out.
For inspiration, take as your model Japanese flower arrangers:
Orderly. Quiet. Focused. Clean. Fresh. Deliberate. You will not find
them trying to practice in noisy coffee shops or bleary-eyed in a rush
at 3 a.m. because they planned poorly. You will not find them picking
up their trimmers on a whim, or in their underwear while they talk
on the phone to an old friend who has just called. All of that is too
random, too chaotic for the true master.
A master is in control. A master has a system. A master turns the
ordinary into the sacred.
And so must we.

GET RID OF YOUR STUFF

For property is poverty and fear; only to have
possessed something and to have let go of it means
carefree ownership.
—RAINER MARIA RILKE

E

pictetus was born a slave but eventually received his freedom. In
time, he came to enjoy the trappings of the good life—or at least
the Stoic version of it. He had emperors attend his lectures, trained
many students, and made a decent living. With his hard-earned
money, he bought a nice iron lamp, which he kept burning in a small
shrine in his home.
One evening, he heard a noise in the hallway by his front door.
Rushing down, he found that a thief had stolen the prized lamp. Like
any person who feels attached to their stuff, he was disappointed and
surprised and violated. Someone had come into his home and stolen
something that belonged to him.
But then Epictetus caught himself. He remembered his teachings.
“Tomorrow, my friend,” he said to himself, “you will find an
earthenware lamp; for a man can only lose what he has.” For the rest
of his life, he kept this cheaper earthen lamp instead. Upon his death,
an admirer, entirely missing the point of Epictetus’s disdain for
material items, purchased it for 3,000 drachmas.
One of Seneca’s most powerful metaphors is the slaveowner
owned by his slaves, or the wealthy man whose vast estates lord over
him rather than the other way around (in modern times, we have our

own term for this: being “house poor”). Montaigne was perceptive
enough to ask whether it was in fact he who was the pet of his cat.
We also find a version of it from the East. Xunzi explained:
The gentleman makes things his servants. The petty man
is servant to things.
In short, mental and spiritual independence matter little if the
things we own in the physical world end up owning us.
The Cynics took this idea the furthest. Diogenes supposedly lived
in a barrel and walked around nearly naked. When he saw a child
drinking water from a well with his hands, Diogenes smashed his
own cup, realizing that he had been carrying around an extraneous
possession.
Today, we might call Diogenes a bum or a loser (or a crazy
person), and in some sense he was those things. But on the few
occasions when Diogenes met Alexander the Great, then the most
powerful man in the world, it was Diogenes who observers came
away thinking was the more impressive. Because Alexander, as much
as he tried, could neither tempt Diogenes with any favors nor deprive
him of anything that he had not already willingly tossed aside.
There was nothing but a shirt between the Stoics and the Cynics,
joked the poet Juvenal, meaning the Stoics were sensible enough to
wear clothes (and refrain from bodily functions in public), unlike the
Cynics. This is a pretty reasonable concession. We don’t need to get
rid of all our possessions, but we should constantly question what we
own, why we own it, and whether we could do without.
Have you ever seen a house torn down? A lifetime of earning and
savings, countless hours of decorating and accumulating until it was
arranged just right, the place of so much living—and in the end it is
reduced to a couple dumpsters full of debris. Even the incredibly
wealthy, even the heads of state showered with gifts throughout their
life, would only fill a few more bins.
Yet how many of us collect and acquire as if the metric tonnage of
our possessions is a comment on our worth as individuals? Just as
every hoarder becomes trapped by their own garbage, so too are we

tied down by what we own. Every piece of expensive jewelry comes
with an insurance bill, every mansion with a staff of groundskeepers,
every investment with obligations and monthly statements to review,
every exotic pet and plant with a set of responsibilities. F. Scott
Fitzgerald said that the rich are different than us, and his novels
portray them as free and without care.
That’s not quite right.
Mo’ money, mo’ problems, and also mo’ stuff, less freedom.
John Boyd, a sort of warrior-monk who revolutionized Western
military strategy in the latter half of the twentieth century, refused to
take checks from defense contractors and deliberately lived in a
small condo even as he advised presidents and generals. “If a man
can reduce his needs to zero,” he said, “he is truly free: there is
nothing that can be taken from him and nothing anyone can do to
hurt him.” To that we would add, “And he or she can also be still.”
No one dogged by creditors is free. Living outside your means—as
Churchill could attest—is not glamorous. Behind the appearances,
it’s exhausting.
It’s also dangerous. The person who is afraid to lose their stuff,
who has their identity wrapped up in their things, gives their
enemies an opening. They make themselves extra vulnerable to fate.
The playwright Tennessee Williams spoke of luxury as the “wolf
at the door.” It wasn’t the possessions that were the problem, he said,
but the dependency. He called it the catastrophe of success, the way
that we become less and less able to do things ourselves, the more
and more we cannot be without a certain level of service. Not only is
all your stuff a mess, but you need to pay someone to come clean it
up.
There is also what we can term “comfort creep.” We get so used to
a certain level of convenience and luxury that it becomes almost
inconceivable that we used to live without it. As wealth grows, so
does our sense of “normal.” But just a few years ago we were fine
without this bounty. We had no problem eating ramen or squeezing
into a small apartment. But now that we have more, our mind begins
to lie to us. You need this. Be anxious that you might lose it. Protect
it. Don’t share.
It’s toxic and scary.

Which is why philosophers have always advocated reducing our
needs and limiting our possessions. Monks and priests take vows of
poverty because it will mean fewer distractions, and more room
(literally) for the spiritual pursuit to which they have committed. No
one is saying we have to go that far, but the more we own, the more
we oversee, the less room we have to move and, ironically, the less
still we become.
Start by walking around your house and filling up trash bags and
boxes with everything you don’t use. Think of it as clearing more
room for your mind and your body. Give yourself space. Give your
mind a rest. Want to have less to be mad about? Less to covet or be
triggered by? Give more away.
The best car is not the one that turns the most heads, but the one
you have to worry about the least. The best clothes are the ones that
are the most comfortable, that require you to spend the least amount
of time shopping—regardless of what the magazines say. The best
house for you is the one that feels the most like home. Don’t use your
money to purchase loneliness, or headaches, or status anxiety.
Your grandmother did not give you that brooch so that you would
constantly worry about losing it. The artist who produced the
painting on your wall was not working hard so that you might one
day fear that a guest would damage it. Nor is the memory of that
beautiful summer in Anguilla actually contained in that carved statue
or the love you share with your spouse limited to the photograph of
the two of you at your wedding. The memory is what’s important.
The experience itself is what matters. You can access that anytime
you want, and no thief can ever deprive you of it.
You will hear people say they don’t have room for a relationship
in their life . . . and they’re right. Their stuff is taking up too much
space. They’re in love with possessions instead of people.
The family who never see each other because the two parents are
working late to pay off the extra bedrooms they never use? The fame
that keeps someone on the road so much they’re a stranger to their
kids? The supposed “technology” that is a pain in the ass to figure
out, that’s always breaking? The fragile, fancy possessions that we’re
constantly cleaning, buffing, protecting, and trying to find ways to
slyly mention in conversation?

This is not a rich life. There is no peace in this.
Take action. Get out from under all your stuff. Get rid of it. Give
away what you don’t need.
You were born free—free of stuff, free of burden. But since the
first time they measured your tiny body for clothes, people have been
foisting stuff upon you. And you’ve been adding links to the pile of
chains yourself ever since.

SEEK SOLITUDE

A crowded world thinks that aloneness is always
loneliness and that to seek it is perversion.
—JOHN GRAVES

I

t was a habit of Leonardo da Vinci’s to write little fables to himself
in his notebooks. One tells the story of a good-sized stone that
rested in a pleasant grove, surrounded by flowers, perched above a
busy country road. Despite this peaceful existence, the stone grew
restless. “What am I doing among these herbs?” he asked. “I want to
live in the company of my fellow stones.”
Unhappy and alone, the stone contrived to roll itself down the hill
onto the road, where it would be surrounded by countless other
stones. But the change was not quite as wonderful as expected. Down
in the dirt, the stone was trod on by horses, driven over by wagons,
and stepped on by people. It was alternately covered in mud and
feces, and chipped at and jostled and moved—painful moments made
all the more painful by the occasional sight the stone was given of its
old home, and the solitary peace it had left behind.
Not content to leave the story at that, Leonardo felt the need to
put a fine point on it. “This is what happens,” he wrote to himself and
every one of us, “to those who leave the solitary and contemplative
life and choose to live in cities among people full of countless evils.”
Of course, Leonardo’s biographers were quick to point out that
the author didn’t always follow the lesson of this fable. He spent
most of his life in Florence and Milan and Rome. He painted in a

busy studio and attended many spectacles and parties. Even his last
years were spent not in secluded retirement but in the bustling court
of King Francis I of France.
His occupation required this. As do many of ours.
Which makes cultivating moments of solitude all the more
essential. To find solitude, the way Eugen Herrigel said that the
Buddhist does, “not in far-off, quiet places; he creates it out of
himself, spreads it around him wherever he may be, because he loves
it.”
While Leonardo was working on The Last Supper, he would get
up early and arrive at the monastery before any of his assistants or
spectators, so he could be alone, in silence, with his thoughts and the
mammoth creative challenge in front of him. He was also notorious
for leaving his studio and going for long walks by himself, carrying a
notebook and simply looking and watching and really seeing what
was happening around him. He loved to visit his uncle’s farm for
inspiration and solitude.
It is difficult to think clearly in rooms filled with other people. It’s
difficult to understand yourself if you are never by yourself. It’s
difficult to have much in the way of clarity and insight if your life is a
constant party and your home is a construction site.
Sometimes you have to disconnect in order to better connect with
yourself and with the people you serve and love.
“If I was to sum up the single biggest problem of senior
leadership in the Information Age,” four-star Marine Corps general
and former secretary of defense James Mattis has said, “it’s lack of
reflection. Solitude allows you to reflect while others are reacting. We
need solitude to refocus on prospective decision-making, rather than
just reacting to problems as they arise.”
People don’t have enough silence in their lives because they don’t
have enough solitude. And they don’t get enough solitude because
they don’t seek out or cultivate silence. It’s a vicious cycle that
prevents stillness and reflection, and then stymies good ideas, which
are almost always hatched in solitude.
Breakthroughs seem to happen with stunning regularity in the
shower or on a long hike. Where don’t they happen? Shouting to be
heard in a bar. Three hours into a television binge. Nobody realizes

just how much they love someone while they’re booking back-to
back-to-back meetings.
If solitude is the school of genius, as the historian Edward Gibbon
put it, then the crowded, busy world is the purgatory of the idiot.
Who isn’t stiller in the morning, or when they’re up before the
house stirs, before the phone rings or the commutes have begun?
Who isn’t better equipped to notice the meaning of the moment
when it’s quiet, when your personal space is being respected? In
solitude time slows down, and while we might find that speed hard to
bear at first, we will ultimately go crazy without this check on the
busyness of life and work. And if not driven crazy, we will certainly
miss out.
Solitude is not just for hermits, but for healthy, functioning
people. Although there is a thing or two we can learn about solitude
from the people who turned pro at it.
In 1941, then just twenty-six years old, Thomas Merton reported
to the Abbey of Gethsemani in Bardstown, Kentucky, and began his
first of many journeys into monkish solitude that would go on, in
various forms, for the next twenty-seven years. His solitude was
hardly indolent repose. It was instead an active exploration of
himself, of religion, of human nature, and later, into solving serious
societal problems like inequality, war, and injustice. In his beautiful
journals, we find insights into the human experience that would have
been impossible if Merton had spent his time in a newspaper bullpen
or even on a university campus.
He would come to call solitude his vocation. As he wrote:
To pray and work in the morning and to labor and rest in
the afternoon, and to sit still again in meditation in the
evening when night falls upon that land and when the
silence fills itself with darkness and with stars. This is a
true and special vocation. There are few who are willing to
belong completely to such silence, to let it soak into their
bones, to breathe nothing but silence, to feed on silence,
and to turn the very substance of their life into a living and
vigilant silence.

In a more emulatable form of Merton’s retreat, Microsoft founder
and philanthropist Bill Gates has, twice a year for many years now,
taken what he calls a “think week.” He spends seven days alone in a
cabin in the forest. There, physically removing himself from the daily
interruptions of his work, he can really sit down and think.
He might be alone there, but he is hardly lonely. Gates reads—
sometimes hundreds of papers—quietly for hours at a time,
sometimes in print, sometimes off computer monitors that look out
over the water. He reads books too, in a library adorned with a
portrait of the author Victor Hugo. He writes long memos to people
across his organization. The only breaks he takes are a few minutes
to play bridge or go for a walk. In those solitary days in that cabin,
Gates is the picture of Thomas à Kempis’s line In omnibus requiem
quaesivi, et nusquam inveni nisi in angulo cum libro—“Everywhere I
have sought peace and not found it, except in a corner with a book.”
Do not mistake this for some kind of vacation. It is hard work—
long days, some without sleep. It is wrestling with complex topics,
contradictory ideas, and identity-challenging concepts. But despite
this struggle, Gates emerges recharged and refocused. He can see
further into the distance. He knows what he wants to prioritize, what
to assign his people to work on. He carries the quiet stillness of the
woods back to the complicated world he has to navigate as a
businessman and philanthropic leader.
Each of us needs to put ourselves, physically, in the position to do
that kind of deep work. We need to give our bodies, as Virginia Woolf
put it, a room of our own—even if only for a few stolen hours—where
we can think and have quiet and solitude. Buddha needed seclusion
in his search for enlightenment. He had to step away from the world,
go off by himself, and sit.
Don’t you think you would benefit from that too?
It’s hard to make that time. It’s hard (and expensive) to get away.
We have responsibilities. But they will be better for our temporary
disappearance. We will carry back with us the stillness from our
solitude in the form of patience, understanding, gratitude, and
insight.
In Leonardo’s fable, the stone abandoned the peaceful solitude of
the meadow for the road and came to regret it. Merton, for his part,

came to occasionally regret his complete solitude. Was there more he
could do as a man of the world? Could he have a bigger impact if he
abandoned his solitude?
Indeed, very few of us are willing or able to make it the totality of
our existence, nor should we. (The dancer Twyla Tharp points out
that “solitude without purpose” is a killer of creativity.) Even in
Merton’s case, he was given special privileges from his church
superior to communicate with the outside world through letters and
writing, and eventually began to travel and speak to large crowds.
Because his work was too important and the insights he discovered
were too essential to remain locked up in a tiny brick house on the
edge of the woods in Kentucky.
Merton eventually came to understand that after so much time by
himself in the woods, he now possessed solitude inside himself—and
could access it anytime he liked. The wise and busy also learn that
solitude and stillness are there in pockets, if we look for them. The
few minutes before going onstage for a talk or sitting in your hotel
room before a meeting. The morning before the rest of the house
wakes up. Or late in the evening after the world has gone to sleep.
Grab these moments. Schedule them. Cultivate them.

BE A HUMAN BEING

Work is what horses die of. Everybody should know
that.
—ALEKSANDR SOLZHENITSYN

C

ompared with most royal couples, Queen Victoria and Prince
Consort Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha were exceptional. They
actually loved each other and they actually worked at, and took
seriously, their jobs as heads of state. This was all very good.
But it could also be argued that any positive trait—even hard
work—taken to excess becomes a vice.
In both their cases, as a couple for whom, by the nature of their
profession, even the idea of “work/life balance” was impossible, the
virtue of their self-discipline and dedication became a fatal vice.
Albert, a Bavarian prince who married into the British royal
family, was a hard worker from the day he married Victoria. He
brought much-needed order and routine to the life of his queen. He
streamlined processes and took up a share of the burdens that had
previously fallen on Victoria alone. Indeed, many of the so-called
Victorian traits of the era originated with him. He was disciplined,
fastidious, ambitious, conservative.
Under his pressing, their schedule became one meeting, dispatch,
and social event after another. Albert was almost constantly busy,
working so much that he occasionally vomited from stress. Never
shirking a responsibility or an opportunity, he took on every bit of
the burden of power his wife was willing to share, and in turn,

together they seized every formal and informal bit of influence the
monarchy had in the British Empire at that time. They were a pair of
workaholics and proud of it.
As Albert wrote to an advisor, he spent hours a day reading
newspapers in German, French, and English. “One can let nothing
pass,” he said, “without losing the connection and coming in
consequence to wrong conclusions.” He was right, the stakes were
certainly high. For instance, his expert understanding of geopolitics
helped Britain avoid being drawn into the U.S. Civil War.
But the truth was, Albert threw himself equally hard into projects
of much less importance. Organizing the Great Exhibition of 1851, a
nearly six-month-long carnival that showed off the wonders of the
British Empire, consumed years of his life. A few days before it
opened, he wrote to his stepmother, “I am more dead than alive from
overwork.” It was, to be certain, a beautiful and memorable event,
but his health never recovered.
He was like Winston Churchill, only he and his wife knew no
moderation and had little fun. “I go on working at my treadmill, as
life seems to me,” Albert said. It’s not a bad description of the
exhausting and repetitive life he and Victoria led. Starting in 1840,
Victoria bore nine children in seventeen years, four of whom were
born in consecutive years. In a time when women still regularly died
during childbirth (anesthesia—chloroform— became available only
for her eighth pregnancy), Victoria, who was a mere five feet tall, was
constantly pregnant. Even with the benefits of limitless household
help, she bore an enormous physical burden on top of her duties as
queen. Upon her death, it was found that she was suffering from a
prolapsed uterus and a hernia that must have caused her incredible
and constant pain.
There’s nothing wrong with having a large family—the throne did
need heirs—but it never seemed to have occurred to the couple that
they had any say in the matter. “Man is a beast of burden,” Albert
wrote to his brother, “and he is only happy if he has to drag his
burden and if he has little free will. My experience teaches me every
day to understand the truth of this more and more.” As a result, his
and Victoria’s existence was hardly one of privilege or relaxation or
freedom. It was instead an endless cycle of obligation after

obligation, done at a breakneck pace that the two of them inflicted on
themselves.
It is a testament to their affection for each other that their
marriage survived. Victoria was at least aware of the deleterious
effects all this work had on Albert. She wrote of the consequences of
his “over-love of business” on their relationship, and she also noticed
that his health was flagging. His racing mind kept him awake at
night, his stomach cramped, and his skin drooped.
Instead of listening to these warning signs, he soldiered on for
years, working harder and harder, forcing his body to comply. And
then, suddenly, in 1861, it quit on him. His strength failed. He drifted
into incoherency, and at 10:50 p.m. on December 14, Albert took his
three final breaths and died. The cause? Crohn’s disease, exacerbated
by extreme stress. He had literally worked his guts out.
Modern medicine has hardly saved us from these tragedies. In
Japan they have a word, karōshi, which translates to death from
overwork. In Korean it’s gwarosa.
Is that what you want to be? A workhorse that draws its load until
it collapses and dies, still shod and in the harness? Is that what you
were put on this planet for?
Remember, the main cause of injury for elite athletes is not
tripping and falling. It’s not collisions. It’s overuse. Pitchers and
quarterbacks throw out their arms. Basketball players blow out their
knees. Others just get tired of the grinding hours and the pressure.
Michael Phelps prematurely ended his swimming career due to
burnout—despite all the gold medals, he never wanted to get in a
pool again. It’s hard to blame him either; he’d put everything,
including his own sanity and health, second to shaving seconds off
his times.
Meanwhile, Eliud Kipchoge, possibly the greatest distance runner
ever to live, actively works to make sure he is not overworking. In
training, he deliberately does not give his full effort, saving that
instead for the few times per year when he races. He prefers instead
to train at 80 percent of his capacity—on occasion to 90 percent—to
maintain and preserve his longevity (and sanity) as an athlete. When
Michael Phelps came back to swimming after his breakdown in 2012,

it was possible because he was willing to reimagine his approach to
training and to approach it with more balance.
Pacing is something athletes are often forced to come to terms
with as they age, while young athletes needlessly burn themselves
out because they think they have a bottomless well of energy. Yes,
there is purity and meaning in giving your best to whatever you do—
but life is much more of a marathon than it is a sprint. In a way, this
is the distinction between confidence and ego. Can you trust yourself
and your abilities enough to keep something in reserve? Can you
protect the stillness and the inner peace necessary to win the longer
race of life?
It was a malicious lie that the Nazis hung over the gates of
Auschwitz: Arbeit macht frei—“Work will set you free.”*
No. No. No.
The Russian proverb had it better: Work just makes you bent
over.
Man is not a beast of burden. Yes, we have important duties—to
our country, to our coworkers, to provide for our families. Many of us
have talents and gifts that are so extraordinary that we owe it to
ourselves and the world to express and fulfill them. But we’re not
going to be able to do that if we’re not taking care of ourselves, or if
we have stretched ourselves to the breaking point.
The moral of the American tall tale about the rail worker John
Henry is often lost on people. He challenges the steam-powered
drilling machine, and through sheer strength and inhuman will, he
beats it. It’s great. Inspiring. Except he dies at the end! Of
exhaustion! “In real life,” George Orwell observed, “it is always the
anvil that breaks the hammer.”
Work will not set you free. It will kill you if you’re not careful.
Prince Albert’s children would have gladly traded a less exciting
Great Exhibition to have Albert for a little longer, and so too would
Queen Victoria and the British people.
The email you think you need so desperately to respond to can
wait. Your screenplay does not need to be hurried, and you can even
take a break between it and the next one. The only person truly
requiring you to spend the night at the office is yourself. It’s okay to
say no. It’s okay to opt out of that phone call or that last-minute trip.

Good decisions are not made by those who are running on empty.
What kind of interior life can you have, what kind of thinking can
you do, when you’re utterly and completely overworked? It’s a
vicious cycle: We end up having to work more to fix the errors we
made when we would have been better off resting, having
consciously said no instead of reflexively saying yes. We end up
pushing good people away (and losing relationships) because we’re
wound so tight and have so little patience.
The bull in Robert Earl Keen’s “Front Porch Song” whose “work is
never done”? Do you want to be the artist who loses their joy for the
process, who has strip-mined their soul in such a way that there is
nothing left to draw upon? Burn out or fade away—that was the
question in Kurt Cobain’s suicide note. How is that even a dilemma?
It’s human being, not human doing, for a reason.
Moderation. Being present. Knowing your limits.
This is the key. The body that each of us has was a gift. Don’t
work it to death. Don’t burn it out.
Protect the gift.

GO TO SLEEP

There is a time for many words and there is a time for
sleep.
—HOMER, THE ODYSSEY

A

merican Apparel was a billion-dollar company that failed for
many reasons. It borrowed too much money. It had a toxic
workplace culture. It was besieged by lawsuits. It opened too many
stores. This was all written about many times during the company’s
public disintegration in 2014.
But one cause of its failure—a major reason why more than ten
thousand people lost their jobs and a company with $700 million in
annual sales simply disappeared—was overlooked by most outside
observers.*
When Dov Charney founded American Apparel, he had the notion
that he would be a completely accessible boss. As the company grew
from a dorm room operation to a global retailer and one of the
largest garment manufacturers in the world, he stuck to that. In fact,
his ego swelled at the idea of being at the center of every part of the
business.
It was a true open-door policy. Not just open-door but phone and
email too. Any employee, at any level of the company, from sleeve
sewer to sales associate to photographer, could reach out whenever
they had a problem. For good measure, during one of the company’s
many public relations crises, Charney posted his phone number
online for any journalist or customer who had an issue as well.

Early on, this policy had advantages. Charney was constantly in
tune with what was happening in the company, and it prevented
bureaucracy from establishing itself and bogging people down. But
not only did the advantage not scale well, but the costs began to take
their toll as well.
You can imagine what happened when the company suddenly had
250 stores in 20 countries. By 2012, Charney was sleeping only a few
hours a night. By 2014, he wasn’t sleeping at all. How could he?
There was always someone with a problem and someone somewhere
in some distant time zone taking him up on the open-door policy.
The human reality of getting older didn’t help either.
It was this extreme, cumulative sleep deprivation that was the
root of so much of the company’s catastrophic failure. How could it
not be? Research has shown that as we approach twenty or so hours
without sleep, we are as cognitively impaired as a drunk person. Our
brains respond more slowly and our judgment is significantly
impaired.
In 2014, during a difficult transition between distribution
facilities, Charney moved into the shipping and fulfillment
warehouse, installing a shower and cot in a small office. To him and
some diehard loyalists, this was proof of his heroic dedication to the
company. In truth, bad judgment had bungled the transition in the
first place, and then his constant presence and micromanaging on
site—which became increasingly erratic the longer it went on and the
longer he went without sleep—only compounded the difficulties.
Charney descended into madness in front of his employees.
Unshaven. Bleary-eyed. At the mercy of his temper, unmoored from
even the most basic judgment or propriety. Issuing orders that
contradicted orders he had issued just minutes before, he seemed
almost hell-bent on destruction. But he was the boss. What could
people do?
Eventually, his mother was called in to bring him home, to coax
him into taking care of himself before it was too late. But he was well
past saving. Even back in the normal office, he would call employees
late, late into the night and sweetly talk about work until he drifted
off, finding that collapsing from exhaustion was the only way he
could put himself to bed.

Within a few months of the warehouse episode, Dov Charney was
on the verge of losing control of the company. Terms of desperate
rounds of financing had made him vulnerable to a takeover, but he
agreed to them without thinking through the implications. Sitting
before his handpicked board of directors, he mixed package after
package of pure Nescafé powder in cold water—essentially
mainlining caffeine to stay awake. By the time he left the meeting, he
no longer had a job.
Within a few months, his shares of the company were worthless.
Investors and debt collectors would find little left to salvage when
they sorted through the wreckage. He now owes a hedge fund twenty
million dollars and cannot even afford a lawyer.
It was an epic implosion along relatively common lines. The
overworked person creates a crisis that they try to solve by working
harder. Mistakes are piled upon mistakes by the exhausted, delirious
mind. The more they try, the worse it gets and the angrier they get
that no one appreciates their sacrifice.
People say, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” as they hasten that very
death, both literally and figuratively. They trade their health for a few
more working hours. They trade the long-term viability of their
business or their career before the urgency of some temporal crisis.
If we treat sleep as a luxury, it is the first to go when we get busy.
If sleep is what happens only when everything is done, work and
others will constantly be impinging on your personal space. You will
feel frazzled and put upon, like a machine that people don’t take care
of and assume will always function.
The philosopher and writer Arthur Schopenhauer used to say that
“sleep is the source of all health and energy.” He said it better still on
a separate occasion: “Sleep is the interest we have to pay on the
capital which is called in at death. The higher the interest rate and
the more regularly it is paid, the further the date of redemption is
postponed.”
Arianna Huffington woke up on the floor of her bathroom a few
years ago, covered in blood, her head searing with pain. She had
passed out from fatigue and broken her cheekbone. Her sister, who
was in the apartment at the time, recalls the sickening sound of
hearing the body hit the tile. It was a literal wake-up call for both of

them. This was no way to live. There was no glamour in working
oneself to the bone, trading sleep for an extra conference call or a few
minutes on television or a meeting with an important person.
That’s not success. It’s torture. And no human can endure it for
long. Indeed, your mind and soul are incapable of peace when your
body is battling for survival, when it is drawing on its reserves for
even basic functioning. Happiness? Stillness? Milking the solitude or
beauty out of your surroundings? Out of the question for the
exhausted, overworked fool.
The bloodshot engineer six Red Bulls deep has no chance of
stillness. Nor does the recent grad—or not-so-recent grad—who still
parties like she’s in college. Nor does the writer who plans poorly and
promises himself he’ll finish his book in a sleepless three-day sprint.
A 2017 study actually found that lack of sleep increases negative
repetitive thinking. Abusing the body leads the mind to abuse itself.
Sleep is the other side of the work we’re doing—sleep is the
recharging of the internal batteries whose energy stores we recruit in
order to do our work. It is a meditative practice. It is stillness. It’s the
time when we turn off. It’s built into our biology for a reason.
We have only so much energy for our work, for our relationships,
for ourselves. A smart person understands this and guards it
carefully. The greats—they protect their sleep because it’s where the
best state of mind comes from. They say no to things. They turn in
when they hit their limits. They don’t let the creep of sleep
deprivation undermine their judgment. They know there are some
people who can function without sleep, but they are also smart and
self-aware enough to know that everyone functions better when wellrested.
Anders Ericsson, of the classic ten-thousand-hours study, found
that master violinists slept eight and a half hours a night on average
and took a nap most days. (A friend said of Churchill, “He made in
Cuba one discovery which was to prove far more important to his
future life than any gain in military experience, the life-giving powers
of the siesta.”) According to Ericsson, great players nap more than
lesser ones.
How did the Zen master Hakuin prepare for his epic lecture, The
Records of Old Sokko? He slept. A lot. He slept so much and so

soundly that one of his students said that “his snores reverberated
through the house like rumblings of thunder.” It went on for more
than a month, with Hakuin waking only to see the occasional visitor.
But every other minute was spent facedown, passed out in blissful,
restful slumber.
His attendants, who had not yet learned to appreciate the power
of sleep, began to worry. The day the talks would be given was
rapidly approaching. Was the master ever going to get serious about
it? Or was he just going to waste his days asleep? They begged him to
start working while there was still time. He simply rolled over and
slept some more. Finally, as the deadline loomed large, but without a
hint of urgency, Hakuin got up. Sitting, he called to his attendants,
and began with perfect clarity to dictate the talk.
It was all there. It was brilliant.
It was the product of a rested mind that took care of its body. A
healthy soul that could sleep soundly. And it has echoed down
through the ages.
If you want peace, there is just one thing to do. If you want to be
your best, there is just one thing to do.
Go to sleep.

FIND A HOBBY

This is the main question, with what activity one’s
leisure is filled.
—ARISTOTLE

W

illiam Gladstone, the four-time prime minister of England, in
the generation before Winston Churchill, had an unusual
hobby. He loved going out into the woods near his home and
chopping down trees.
Huge trees. By hand.
In January 1876, he spent two full days working on an elm tree
with a girth of some sixteen feet. From Gladstone’s diary, we note
that on more than one thousand occasions he went to the forest with
his axe, often bringing his family along and making an outing of it. It
was said that he found the process so consuming, he had no time to
think of anything but where the next stroke of his axe would fall.
Many critics, one of whom happened to be Churchill’s father,
criticized Gladstone’s hobby as destructive. It really wasn’t.
Gladstone planted many trees in his life, pruned hundreds more, and
aggressively protected the health of the forests near his home,
believing that removing dead or decaying trees was a minor but
important service. In response to some critics who questioned why
he had taken down a particular oak, he explained that removing the
rotten members from the forest allowed more light and air to get to
the good trees—just as in politics (a joke for which he was promptly

cheered). His daughters also sold slivers of wood from the trees their
father had cut down as souvenirs to raise money for charity.
But above all, Gladstone’s arboreal activity was a way to rest a
mind that was often wearied by politics and the stresses of life.
During his final three terms as prime minister, from 1880 to the
early 1890s, Gladstone was out in the woods inspecting or chopping
more than three hundred times. Nor was an axe the only tool he used
to relax or be present. Gladstone was also said to enjoy vigorous
hikes, and mountain climbing well into old age, and the only thing
that appears in his diary more than tree felling is reading. (He
collected and read some twenty-five thousand books during his life.)
These activities were a relief from the pressures of politics, a
challenge for which effort was always rewarded and with which his
opponents could not interfere.
Without these release valves, who knows if he could have been as
good a leader? Without the lessons he learned in those woods—about
persistence, about patience, about doing your best, about the
importance of momentum and gravity—could he have fought the
long and good fight for the causes he believed in?
Nope.
When most of us hear the word “leisure,” we think of lounging
around and doing nothing. In fact, this is a perversion of a sacred
notion. In Greek, “leisure” is rendered as scholé—that is, school.
Leisure historically meant simply freedom from the work needed to
survive, freedom for intellectual or creative pursuits. It was learning
and study and the pursuit of higher things.
As society advanced and jobs became increasingly less physical,
but more exhausting mentally and spiritually, it became common for
leisure to include a diverse array of activities, from reading to
woodwork. Jesus, for instance, rested out on the water, fishing with
his disciples. Seneca wrote about how Socrates loved to play with
children, how Cato loved to relax with wine, how Scipio was
passionate about music. And we know this because Seneca’s own
leisure from politics was writing thoughtful, philosophical letters to
friends. John Cage picked up the hobby of mushroom hunting. He
observed that traipsing through the woods opened up the mind and
encouraged ideas to “fly into one’s head like birds.” Fred Rogers had
Á

his swimming. Saint Teresa of Ávila loved to dance, and so did Mae
Carol Jemison, the first African American woman in space. Simón
Bolívar too found dancing a helpful tool in balancing the affairs of
state and the burdens of revolution. The writer David Sedaris likes to
walk the back roads of his neighborhood in the English countryside
and pick up garbage, often for hours at a time. John Graves poured
himself into carving out his ranch from the Texas Hill Country, fixing
fences, raising cattle, and cultivating the land. Herbert Hoover loved
fishing so much, he wrote a book about it. The title: Fishing for Fun:
And to Wash Your Soul.
The swordsman Musashi, whose work was aggressively and
violently physical, took up painting late in life, and observed that
each form of art enriched the other. Indeed, flower arranging,
calligraphy, and poetry have long been popular with Japanese
generals and warriors, a wonderful pairing of opposites—strength
and gentleness, stillness and aggression. Hakuin, the Zen master,
excelled at painting and calligraphy, producing thousands of works
in his lifetime. NBA champion Chris Bosh taught himself how to
code. Einstein had his violin, Pythagoras has his lyre. William Osler,
the founder of Johns Hopkins University, told aspiring medical
students that when chemistry or anatomy distressed their soul, “seek
peace in the great pacifier, Shakespeare.”
Reading. Boxing. Collecting stamps. Whatever. Let it relax you
and give you peace.
In his essay on leisure, Josef Pieper wrote that “the ability to be
‘at leisure’ is one of the basic powers of the human soul.” But that’s
what’s so interesting about it. It’s a physical state—a physical action
—that somehow replenishes and strengthens the soul. Leisure is not
the absence of activity, it is activity. What is absent is any external
justification—you can’t do leisure for pay, you can’t do it to impress
people.
You have to do it for you.
But the good news is that leisure can be anything. It can be
cutting down trees, or learning another language. Camping or
restoring old cars. Writing poetry or knitting. Running marathons,
riding horses, or walking the beach with a metal detector. It can be,
as it was for Churchill, painting or bricklaying.

Pieper said that leisure was like saying a prayer before bed. It
might help you go to sleep—just as leisure might help you get better
at your job—but that can’t be the point.
Many people find relief in strenuous exercise. Sure, it might make
them stronger at work, but that’s not why they do it. It’s meditative
to put the body in motion and direct our mental efforts at conquering
our physical limitations. The repetition of a long swim, the challenge
of lifting heavy weights, the breathlessness of a sprint—there is a
cleansing experience, even if it is accompanied by suffering. It’s a
wonderful feeling there, right before the sweat breaks, when we can
feel ourselves working the stress up from the deep recesses of our
soul and our conscious mind and then out of the body.
“If an action tires your body but puts your heart at ease,” Xunzi
said, “do it.” There is a reason philosophers in the West often trained
in wrestling and boxing, while philosophers in the East trained in
martial arts. These are not easy activities, and if you’re not present
while you do them, you’ll get your ass kicked.
The point isn’t to simply fill the hours or distract the mind.
Rather, it’s to engage a pursuit that simultaneously challenges and
relaxes us. Students observed that in his leisure moments, Confucius
was “composed and yet fully at ease.” (He was also said to be very
skilled at “menial” tasks.) That’s the idea. It’s an opportunity to
practice and embody stillness but in another context.
It’s in this leisure, Ovid observed, that “we reveal what kind of
people we are.”
Assembling a puzzle, struggling with a guitar lesson, sitting on a
quiet morning in a hunting blind, steadying a rifle or a bow while we
wait for a deer, ladling soup in a homeless shelter. Our bodies are
busy, but our minds are open. Our hearts too.
Of course, leisure can easily become an escape, but the second
that happens it’s not leisure anymore. When we take something
relaxing and turn it into a compulsion, it’s not leisure, because we’re
no longer choosing it.
There is no stillness in that.
While we don’t want our leisure to become work, we do have to
work to make time for them. “For me,” Nixon wrote in his memoir,
“it is often harder to be away from the job than to be working at it.”

On the job, we are busy. We are needed. We have power. We are
validated. We have conflict and urgency and an endless stream of
distractions. Nixon said that the constant grind was “absolutely
necessary for superior performance.” But was his performance really
that superior? Or was that the whole problem?
At leisure, we are with ourselves. We are present. It’s us and the
fishing pole and the sound of the line going into the water. It’s us and
the waiting, giving up control. It’s us and the flash cards for the
language we are learning. It’s the humility of being bad at something
because we are a beginner, but having the confidence to trust in the
process.
No one is making us do this. We can quit if we’re struggling, we
can cut corners and cheat (ourselves) without fear of repercussion.
No money is on the line to motivate us, no rewards or validation but
the experience. To do leisure well—to be present, to be open, to be
virtuous, to be connected—is hard. We cannot let it turn into a job,
into another thing to dominate and to dominate others through.
We must be disciplined about our discipline and moderate in our
moderation.
Life is about balance, not about swinging from one pole to the
other. Too many people alternate between working and bingeing, on
television, on food, on video games, on lying around wondering why
they are bored. The chaos of life leads into the chaos of planning a
vacation.
Sitting alone with a canvas? A book club? A whole afternoon for
cycling? Chopping down trees? Who has the time?
If Churchill had the time, if Gladstone had the time, you have the
time.
Won’t my work suffer if I step away from it?
Seneca pointed out how readily we take risks with uncertain
payoffs in our career—but we’re afraid to risk even one minute of
time for leisure.
There’s nothing to feel guilty about for being idle. It’s not
reckless. It’s an investment. There is nourishment in pursuits that
have no purpose—that is their purpose.
Leisure is also a reward for the work we do. When we think about
the ideal “Renaissance man,” we see someone who is active and busy,

yes, but also fulfilled and balanced. Getting to know yourself is the
luxury of the success you’ve had. Finding fulfillment and joy in the
pursuit of higher things, you’ve earned it. It’s there for you, take it.
Make the time. Build the discipline.
You deserve it. You need it.
Your stillness depends on it.

BEWARE ESCAPISM

Me miserable! which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell.
—JOHN MILTON

A

fter the crushing disappointment of the unexpected failure of his
great novel Ask the Dust, John Fante needed an escape. He
would have loved to hit the road, to flee the town and the state that
had broken his heart, but he couldn’t. Fante was alternately too poor
and then too successful as a screenwriter to afford to leave
Hollywood. And soon after that, he was too married and had too
many kids to support.
Over the years he found many ways to numb the pain he felt. By
playing pinball for hours on end (his addiction was extreme enough
to be immortalized as a character in William Saroyan’s The Time of
Your Life). By drinking for hours on end in Hollywood bars, where
he kept company with F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner. By
spending so many hours on the course that he turned his everpatient wife, Joyce, into a golf widow.
It wasn’t restoration that Fante was chasing, nor was it leisure, it
was escape from real life.
In his own words, Fante pissed away decades golfing, reading,
and drinking, and by extension not writing novels. Because that felt
better than getting rejected again and again. Because it was easier

than sitting alone by himself in a room, doing battle with the demons
that made his writing so beautiful in the first place.
That’s the difference between leisure and escapism. It’s the
intention. Travel is wonderful, but is there not something sad to the
story in Johnny Cash’s life, as his first marriage fell apart and his
music became more formulaic and less fulfilling? Landing in L.A. at
the end of a long tour, instead of heading home to his family, he
walked up to the counter and asked to buy a ticket. To where?
“Wherever the next plane will take me,” he told the attendant.
Despair and restlessness go together.
The problem is that you can’t flee despair. You can’t escape, with
your body, problems that exist in your mind and soul. You can’t run
away from your choices—you can only fix them with better choices.
There’s nothing wrong with a good vacation (particularly if the
aim is solitude and quiet) or a round of golf, just as there is nothing
wrong with cracking a beer to take the edge off. Certainly Churchill
loved to travel and enjoyed champagne, though he stunk at golf.
But too often, the frenzied or the miserable think that an escape—
literal or chemical—is a positive good. Sure, the rush of traveling, the
thrill of surfing, or the altered state of a psychedelic can relieve some
of the tension that’s built up in our lives. Maybe you get some pretty
pictures out of it, and some pseudo-profundity that impresses your
friends.
But when that wears off? What’s left?
Nixon watched nearly five hundred movies during his time in the
White House. We know the darkness he was running from. There’s
no question that for Tiger Woods, his addictions were in part driven
by a desire to escape the pain left over from his childhood. But each
time he hopped on a private plane to Vegas instead of opening up to
his wife (or to his father while he was still alive), he was setting
himself up for more pain down the road. Each time John Fante hit
the golf course instead of the keys of his typewriter, or went out
drinking instead of being at home, he might have felt a temporary
escape, but it came at a very high cost.
When you defer and delay, interest is accumulating. The bill still
comes due . . . and it will be even harder to afford then than it will be
right now.

The one thing you can’t escape in your life is yourself.
Anyone who’s traveled long enough knows this. It’s eventually
clear we carry with us on the road more baggage than just our
suitcase and our backpacks.
Emerson, who in his own life traveled to England and Italy and
France and Malta and Switzerland (as well as extensively across
America), pointed out that the people who built the sights and
wonders that tourists liked to see didn’t do so while they traveled.
You can’t make something great flitting around. You have to stick
fast, like an axis of the earth. Those who think they will find
solutions to all their problems by traveling far from home, perhaps as
they stare at the Colosseum or some enormous moss-covered statue
of Buddha, Emerson said, are bringing ruins to ruins. Wherever they
go, whatever they do, their sad self comes along.
A plane ticket or a pill or some plant medicine is a treadmill, not a
shortcut. What you seek will come only if you sit and do the work, if
you probe yourself with real self-awareness and patience.
You have to be still enough to discover what’s really going on. You
have to let the muddy water settle. That can’t happen if you’re jetting
off from one place to another, if you’re packing your schedule with
every activity you can think of in order to avoid the possibility of
having to spend even a moment alone with your own thoughts.
In the fourth century BC, Mengzi spoke of how the Way is near,
but people seek it in what is distant. A few generations after that,
Marcus Aurelius pointed out that we don’t need to “get away from it
all.” We just need to look within. “Nowhere you can go is more
peaceful—more free of interruptions,” he said, “than your own soul.”
The next time we feel the urge to flee, to hit the road or bury
ourselves in work or activity, we need to catch ourselves. Don’t book
a cross-country flight—go for a walk instead. Don’t get high—get
some solitude, find some quiet. These are far easier, far more
accessible, and ultimately far more sustainable strategies for
accessing the stillness we were born with. Travel inside your heart
and your mind, and let the body stay put. “A quick visit should be
enough to ward off all,” Marcus wrote, “and send you back ready to
face what awaits you.”
Tuning out accomplishes nothing. Tune in.

If true peace and clarity are what you seek in this life—and by the
way, they are what you deserve—know that you will find them nearby
and not far away. Stick fast, as Emerson said. Turn into yourself.
Stand in place.
Stand in front of the mirror. Get to know your front porch.
You were given one body when you were born—don’t try to be
someone else, somewhere else. Get to know yourself.
Build a life that you don’t need to escape from.

ACT BRAVELY

To see people who will notice a need in the world and
do something about it. . . . Those are my heroes.
—FRED ROGERS

I

n Camus’s final novel, The Fall, his narrator, Clamence, is walking
alone on a street in Amsterdam when he hears what sounds like a
woman falling into the water. He’s not totally certain that’s what he
heard, but mostly, riding the high of a nice evening with his mistress,
he does not want to be bothered, and so he continues on.
A respected lawyer with a reputation as a person of great virtue in
his community, Clamence returns to his normal life the following day
and attempts to forget the sound he heard. He continues to represent
clients and entertain his friends with persuasive political arguments,
as he always has.
Yet he begins to feel off.
One day, after a triumphant appearance in court arguing for a
blind client, Clamence gets the feeling he is being mocked and
laughed at by a group of strangers he can’t quite locate. Later,
approaching a stalled motorist at an intersection, he is unexpectedly
insulted and then assaulted. These encounters are unrelated, but
they contribute to a weakening of the illusions he has long held about
himself.
It is not with an epiphany or from a blow to the head that the
monstrous truth of what he has done becomes clear. It is a slow,
creeping realization that comes to Clamence that suddenly and

irrevocably changes his self-perception: That night on the canal he
shrugged off a chance to save someone from committing suicide.
This realization is Clamence’s undoing and the central focus of
the book. Forced to see the hollowness of his pretensions and the
shame of his failings, he unravels. He had believed he was a good
man, but when the moment (indeed moments) called for goodness,
he slunk off into the night.
It’s a thought that haunts him incessantly. As he walks the streets
at night, the cry of that woman—the one he ignored so many years
ago—never ceases to torment him. It toys with him too, because his
only hope of redemption is that he might hear it again in real life and
then seize the opportunity to dive in and save someone from the
bottom of the canal.
It’s too late. He has failed. He will never be at peace again.
The story is fictional, of course, but a deeply incisive one, written
not coincidentally in the aftermath of the incredible moral failings of
Europe in the Second World War. Camus’s message to the reader
pierces us like the scream of the woman in Clamence’s memory:
High-minded thoughts and inner work are one thing, but all that
matters is what you do. The health of our spiritual ideals depends on
what we do with our bodies in moments of truth.
It is worth comparing the agony and torture of Clamence with a
more recent example from another French philosopher, Anne
Dufourmantelle, who died in 2017, aged fifty-three, rushing into the
surf to save two drowning children who were not her own. In her
writing, Anne had spoken often of risk—saying that it was impossible
to live life without risk and that in fact, life is risk. It is in the
presence of danger, she once said in an interview, that we are gifted
with the “strong incentive for action, dedication, and surpassing
oneself.”
And when, on the beach in Saint-Tropez, she was faced with a
moment of danger and risk, an opportunity to turn away or to do
good, she committed the full measure of devotion to her ideals.
What is better? To live as a coward or to die a hero? To fall
woefully short of what you know to be right or to fall in the line of
duty? And which is more natural? To refuse a call from your fellow
humans or to dive in bravely and help them when they need you?

Stillness is not an excuse to withdraw from the affairs of the
world. Quite the opposite—it’s a tool to let you do more good for
more people.
Neither the Buddhists nor the Stoics believed in what has come to
be called “original sin”—that we are a fallen and flawed and broken
species. On the contrary, they believe we were born good. To them,
the phrase “Be natural” was the same as “Do the right thing.” For
Aristotle, virtue wasn’t just something contained in the soul—it was
how we lived. It was what we did. He called it eudaimonia: human
flourishing.
A person who makes selfish choices or acts contrary to their
conscience will never be at peace. A person who sits back while
others suffer or struggle will never feel good, or feel that they are
enough, no matter how much they accomplish or how impressive
their reputation may be.
A person who does good regularly will feel good. A person who
contributes to their community will feel like they are a part of one. A
person who puts their body to good use—volunteering, protecting,
serving, standing up for—will not need to treat it like an amusement
park to get some thrills.
Virtue is not an abstract notion. We are not clearing our minds
and separating the essential from the inessential for the purposes of
a parlor trick. Nor are we improving ourselves so that we can get
richer or more powerful.
We are doing it to live better and be better.
Every person we meet and every situation we find ourselves in is
an opportunity to prove that.
It’s the old Boy Scout motto: “Do a Good Turn Daily.”
Some good turns are big, like saving a life or protecting the
environment. But good turns can also be small, Scouts are taught,
like a thoughtful gesture, mowing a neighbor’s lawn, calling 911 when
you see something amiss, holding open a door, making friends with a
new kid at school. It’s the brave who do these things. It’s the people
who do these things who make the world worth living in.
Marcus Aurelius spoke of moving from one unselfish action to
another—“only there,” he said, can we find “delight and stillness.” In
the Bible, Matthew 5:6 says that those who do right will be made full

by God. Too many believers seem to think that belief is enough. How
many people who claim to be of this religion or that one, if caught
and investigated, would be found guilty of living the tenets of love
and charity and selflessness?
Action is what matters.
Pick up the phone and make the call to tell someone what they
mean to you. Share your wealth. Run for office. Pick up the trash you
see on the ground. Step in when someone is being bullied. Step in
even if you’re scared, even if you might get hurt. Tell the truth.
Maintain your vows, keep your word. Stretch out a hand to someone
who has fallen.
Do the hard good deeds. “You must do the thing you cannot do,”
Eleanor Roosevelt said.
It will be scary. It won’t always be easy, but know that what is on
the other side of goodness is true stillness.
Think of Dorothy Day, and indeed, many other less famous
Catholic nuns, who worked themselves to the bone helping other
people. While they may have lacked for physical possessions and
wealth, they found great comfort in seeing the shelters they had
provided, and the self-respect they’d restored for people whom
society had cast aside. Let us compare that to the anxiety of the
helicopter parents who think of nothing but which preschool to
enroll their toddler in, or the embezzling business partner who is just
one audit away from getting caught. Compare that to the nagging
insecurity we feel knowing that we are not living the way we should
or that we are not doing enough for other people.
If you see fraud, and do not say fraud, the philosopher Nassim
Taleb has said, you are a fraud. Worse, you will feel like a fraud. And
you will never feel proud or happy or confident.
Will we fall short of our own standards? Yes. When this happens,
we don’t need to whip ourselves, as Clamence did, we must simply let
it instruct and teach us, as all injuries do.
That’s why twelve-step groups ask their members to be of service
as part of their recovery. Not because good deeds can undo the past,
but because they help get us out of our heads, and in the process,
help us write the script for a better future.
If we want to be good and feel good, we have to do good.

There is no escaping this.
Dive in when you hear the cry for help. Reach out when you see
the need. Do kindness where you can.
Because you’ll have to find a way to live with yourself if you don’t.

ON TO THE FINAL ACT

As a well-spent day brings a happy sleep, so a wellemployed life brings a happy death.
—LEONARDO DA VINCI

I

t was AD 161 and the emperor Antoninus Pius knew he was going
to die. He was seventy-four years old and he could feel the life
leaving his body. A fever had taken hold and his stomach pained him.
With his last bit of strength, he called his adopted son Marcus
Aurelius into the room and began the process of transferring the
state over to him. When this task was complete, Antoninus turned to
his royal audience and spoke his final word—a word that would echo
down through not just the life of his son but all of history, down even
to us today: aequanimitas.
A few hundred years before, in roughly 400 BC, Buddha accepted
with equal equanimity that he too would soon pass from this earth.
He was a little older than Antoninus, but he had not certified a
successor, for although he was born a prince, he’d renounced his
patrimony in the pursuit of enlightenment. Still, he could tell that his
students were worried about losing him, about how they would
continue their journey without his guidance and love.
“You may be thinking,” he said to them, “‘The word of the
Teacher is now a thing of the past; now we have no more teacher.’
But that is not how you should see it. Let the Dhamma and the
Discipline that I have taught you be your Teacher when I am gone.”

Then, just as Antoninus had done, he prepared for his final
words. His last chance for passing on wisdom to the people he loved,
to the people he knew would face all the difficulties that life throws at
us. “All individual things pass away,” he said. “Seek your liberation
with diligence.”
Then Buddha fell into a deep sleep and never woke again.
It is fitting that between the deaths of these two titans came
Epicurus, the philosopher whose unique way of living almost
perfectly bridges the Eastern and Western schools. In 270 BC, he
also had the self-awareness to know he did not have much more
time. “On this happy day, which is the last day of my life,” Epicurus
began his final letter, “I write the following words to you.” Despite
the considerable pain he felt, his body racked by blockages in the
bladder and bowels, he wrote instead of the joy in his heart, and the
fond recollections he had of conversations with his friends. Then he
got to the purpose of the letter—a set of instructions for the care of a
promising pupil he wanted to make sure was looked after. Within a
few hours and without much fanfare, Epicurus would join Buddha
and Antoninus in eternity, in death.
Three approaches. Different, but in the end the same.
Clear.
Calm.
Kind.
Still.
Each of the domains we have studied addressed in their own way.
The mind.
The soul.
The body.
The mental. The spiritual. The physical.
Three legs in a stool. Three points along a perfect circle.
None of us are long for this world. Death hangs over us all,
whether we notice or not, whether we believe it or not.
Tomorrow, we could discover we have cancer. Two weeks from
now, a heavy branch could fall from a tree and take us with it. The
prognosis is terminal for each and every person and has been from
the moment we were born. Our heart beats without fail for an
uncertain amount of time, and then one day, suddenly, it is still.

Memento mori.
This is a fact that, perhaps more than anything else, is responsible
for incredible amounts of anxiety and distress. It’s scary to think that
we will die. As is the fact that we cannot know for certain what will
happen when death comes, whenever that is. Is there such a thing as
heaven? Or hell? Is death painful? Is it nothingness, a dark backward
abysm of time?
Seneca reminded himself that before we were born we were still
and at peace, and so we will be once again after we die. A light loses
nothing by being extinguished, he said, it just goes back to how it was
before.
The denial of this simple, humbling reality—the denial of death—
is why we attempt to build monuments to our own greatness, it’s why
we worry and argue so much, why we chase pleasure and money and
cannot be still while we are alive. It’s ironic that we spend so much of
our precious time on earth either impotently fighting death or futilely
attempting to ignore the thought of it.
It was Cicero who said that to study philosophy is to learn how to
die.
Most of this book has been about how to live well. But in so doing,
it is also about how to die well. Because they are the same thing.
Death is where the three domains we have studied in these pages
come together.
We must learn to think rationally and clearly about our own fate.
We must find spiritual meaning and goodness while we are alive.
We must treat the vessel we inhabit on this planet well—or we
will be forced to abandon it early.
Death brings an end to everything, to our minds, our souls, and
our bodies, in a final, permanent stillness.
So we end this book there as well.

AFTERWORD

I

t’s getting to be early evening now, and about time for me to get up
from the computer, having made some progress on the pages you
just read. Years ago I got myself out of the busy city and set up my
family here, on a little spread outside town, with a picture of Oliver
Sacks and his “No!” sign hanging above my desk. Now that my
writing day is done, I’ve got work to do on the farm—chickens to
feed, some donkeys to sneak carrots to, and fences to inspect. Not
unlike the plot of that Zen poem about the taming of the bull, my
neighbor’s longhorn has gotten onto my property, and I need to go
find him.
My young son helps me load some tools into the back of the ATV
—“the tractor, the twahktor!” he calls it—and then I hug him and
head down the levee, through to the middle pasture, and back down
by the creek. The fence there has started to weaken, from the
elements and the explorations of the wayward bull, and I spend the
next hour grabbing and pinching T-post clips. You take the clip and
wrap it around the back of the post, grab the end with the pliers,
hooking it over the wire and twisting it tight so it can’t come loose.
Wrap, grab, hook, twist. Wrap, grab, hook, twist.
No thinking, just doing.
The sweat gets going quickly in Texas, and my leather gloves are
shades darker almost as soon as I start. But by the end the fence is
tight. I tell myself it will hold—or so I hope. Next up is moving the
hay, backing the buggy up to the round bale, letting the arm fall over
top of it, and then gunning the engine of the ATV. It catches, teeters,
flips up, and falls over, two thousand pounds of food now lying flat
on the trailer. By the time I’ve driven to where I need to drop it, the

cows have gotten wise to the sound and come running to investigate.
I line it up with the hay ring, back up again, and watch it come
tumbling off the back. With the knife in my pocket, I cut off the
netting and drop the heavy steel hay ring over it to prevent waste.
The cows begin to eat, yelling in appreciation, jostling with each
other for their place at the bale.
With them properly distracted, it’s time for me to go find this
bull. I heard him when I was working and suspect he’s over in the
back corner of the front pasture. I find him there, a ton or more of
muscle and horns. I’m a little frustrated. This is not my problem,
though my neighbor seems not to mind that this keeps happening. I
behold him there, as the poem says, but keep my distance. Not just
because I don’t want to be gored, but because in rushing this process
before, in getting him worked up, I’ve run the bull right through a
barbed-wire fence—a costly reminder of the risks of impatience.
The key is to nudge him in the direction you want to go, to
eliminate the other options and then get him moving. It’s got to feel
like it’s his idea. Otherwise, he’ll panic and get angry. And the
problem goes from bad to worse.
So I just stand there, resting against some cedar, looking up at the
first croppings of the Violet Crown—the Texas sunset that settles
over Austin—that is coming toward the horizon. In this moment, I
am at peace. It doesn’t matter how tough things have been lately. It
doesn’t matter what’s going on in the world. My breathing is slowing
down. There is no social media here. The outrage factory that has
become the news cycle can’t reach me. Neither can my clients or
business partners—there’s no reception in these woods. I am far from
this manuscript I have been working on. Far from my research and
my notes, from my comfortable office and the craft that I love. And
here, far from my work, the story of Shawn Green, which I read
months ago, and what he was really teaching us slips from my
subconscious into the front of my mind. I get it now. I get what he
was after.
Chop wood, carry water. Fix fences, load hay, seize the bull.
My mind is empty. My heart is full. My body is busy.
Attamen tranquillus.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

One of the simplest and most accessible entry points into stillness is
gratitude. Gratitude for being alive, for the lucky breaks you’ve
gotten, and for all the people in your life who have helped you. Each
morning, I try to take some time to think about these very things, but
for the most part, such thanks remain private. With this little space
allowed to me here, I’d like to thank everyone who helped make this
book possible—my wife, Samantha, first and foremost. I am grateful
for her guidance and support and natural stillness, which I learn
from constantly. My son, Clark, who went on many long walks with
me as I worked out the words in this book. My sister, Amy, whose
poise and strength as she battles cancer has deeply moved and
humbled me. I am grateful to my agent and collaborator, Steve
Hanselman, who helped not only with translations but with the
shaping of the idea. Nils Parker, who has been a sounding board for
my writing ideas for over a decade now, and Brent Underwood for all
his help marketing and building my platform. Thank you to Hristo
Vassilev for all his important research and fact-checking help. Niki
Papadopoulos, my editor, and the rest of the Portfolio team at
Penguin Random House—thank you for all the work on all my books.
To the logos that brought all these people and factors together . . .
I should also thank my donkeys and cows and goats (for their
lessons on being, not doing), but there are too many to name. I’m
also grateful for the chance to workshop many of the ideas in this
book on Thought Catalog, Observer, Medium, and DailyStoic.com
My final and most serious gratitude goes out to the thinkers and
philosophers whose ideas make up this book. It would not have been
possible without them, but more important, their insights and

writings have made my life better. I’m grateful too to the heroes (and
villains) in the stories written here, as their all-too-human successes
and failures both inspire and caution anyone in search of happiness,
excellence, and stillness. My own search is nowhere near complete,
but their example has helped me make a few inches on a journey that
—God(s) willing—is only just beginning.
