The Meditations
By Marcus Aurelius


Translated by George Long

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK ONE

From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government
of my temper. 

From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly
character. 

From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from
evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in
my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.

From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools,
and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things
a man should spend liberally. 

From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party
at the games in the Circus, nor a partizan either of the Parmularius
or the Scutarius at the gladiators' fights; from him too I learned
endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands,
and not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to be ready
to listen to slander. 

From Diognetus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not
to give credit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about
incantations and the driving away of daemons and such things; and
not to breed quails for fighting, nor to give myself up passionately
to such things; and to endure freedom of speech; and to have become
intimate with philosophy; and to have been a hearer, first of Bacchius,
then of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written dialogues in my
youth; and to have desired a plank bed and skin, and whatever else
of the kind belongs to the Grecian discipline. 

From Rusticus I received the impression that my character required
improvement and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray
to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, nor
to delivering little hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off
as a man who practises much discipline, or does benevolent acts in
order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry,
and fine writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor
dress, nor to do other things of the kind; and to write my letters
with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa
to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended me by words,
or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled,
as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and to read
carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding
of a book; nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch;
and I am indebted to him for being acquainted with the discourses
of Epictetus, which he communicated to me out of his own collection.

From Apollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness
of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except
to reason; and to be always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion
of the loss of a child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in
a living example that the same man can be both most resolute and yielding,
and not peevish in giving his instruction; and to have had before
my eyes a man who clearly considered his experience and his skill
in expounding philosophical principles as the smallest of his merits;
and from him I learned how to receive from friends what are esteemed
favours, without being either humbled by them or letting them pass
unnoticed. 

From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family
governed in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably
to nature; and gravity without affectation, and to look carefully
after the interests of friends, and to tolerate ignorant persons,
and those who form opinions without consideration: he had the power
of readily accommodating himself to all, so that intercourse with
him was more agreeable than any flattery; and at the same time he
was most highly venerated by those who associated with him: and he
had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an intelligent
and methodical way, the principles necessary for life; and he never
showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from passion,
and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without
noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.

From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and
not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous
or solecistic or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce
the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the way
of answer or giving confirmation, or joining in an inquiry about the
thing itself, not about the word, or by some other fit suggestion.

From Fronto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy
are in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called
Patricians are rather deficient in paternal affection. 

From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity
to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that I have no leisure;
nor continually to excuse the neglect of duties required by our relation
to those with whom we live, by alleging urgent occupations.

From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even
if he should find fault without reason, but to try to restore him
to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of teachers,
as it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus; and to love my children
truly. 

From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to
love justice; and through him I learned to know Thrasea, Helvidius,
Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him I received the idea of a polity in
which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard
to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly
government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed;
I learned from him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in
my regard for philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give
to others readily, and to cherish good hopes, and to believe that
I am loved by my friends; and in him I observed no concealment of
his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned, and that his
friends had no need to conjecture what he wished or did not wish,
but it was quite plain. 

From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by
anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness;
and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity,
and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that
everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that
he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement
and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a
thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise
his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious.
He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive,
and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of
a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who
had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that
he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better
man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way.

In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution
in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and
no vainglory in those things which men call honours; and a love of
labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had
anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness
in giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived
from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission.
And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered
himself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends
from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity
when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by
reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed
too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and
his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through
being satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; and
that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired
of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied
on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off,
and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately
popular applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful over the
things which were necessary for the administration of the empire,
and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure
the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious
with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying
to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety
in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action,
nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the
commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply,
he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when
he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had
them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that
he was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant;
but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery,
able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this, he honoured
those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who
pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He
was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without
any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body's
health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard
to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through
his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's
art or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to
give way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty,
such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or
of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy
reputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably
to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation
of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but
he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the
same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately
fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not
but very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and
he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles
and the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people,
and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be
done, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not
take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses,
nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of
his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from
Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know
how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon;
and such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor
implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to
the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he
had abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously
and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded
of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy,
those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy
without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to
be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible
soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus. 

To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents,
a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends,
nearly everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not
hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition
which, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something
of this kind; but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence
of circumstances as put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to
the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine,
and that I preserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not make
proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the
time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to
take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that
it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either
guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like
show; but that it is in such a man's power to bring himself very near
to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason
either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to
the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner
that befits a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother,
who was able by his moral character to rouse me to vigilance over
myself, and who, at the same time, pleased me by his respect and affection;
that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I
did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies,
in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen
that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those
who brought me up in the station of honour, which they seemed to desire,
without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time after,
because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus,
Maximus; that I received clear and frequent impressions about living
according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so
far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations,
nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to nature, though
I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing
the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions;
that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never
touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen
into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of
humour with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion
to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, she
spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished
to help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never
told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the
same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that
I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple;
that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies
have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against bloodspitting
and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy,
I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste
my time on writers of histories, or in the resolution of syllogisms,
or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens;
for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune.

Among the Quadi at the Granua. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK TWO

Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body,
the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these
things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good
and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful,
and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong,
that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that
it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the
divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can
fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate
him, For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like
eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against
one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one
another to be vexed and to turn away. 

Whatever this is that I am, it is a little flesh and breath, and the
ruling part. Throw away thy books; no longer distract thyself: it
is not allowed; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh;
it is blood and bones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins,
and arteries. See the breath also, what kind of a thing it is, air,
and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again sucked
in. The third then is the ruling part: consider thus: Thou art an
old man; no longer let this be a slave, no longer be pulled by the
strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, no longer either be dissatisfied
with thy present lot, or shrink from the future. 

All that is from the gods is full of Providence. That which is from
fortune is not separated from nature or without an interweaving and
involution with the things which are ordered by Providence. From thence
all things flow; and there is besides necessity, and that which is
for the advantage of the whole universe, of which thou art a part.
But that is good for every part of nature which the nature of the
whole brings, and what serves to maintain this nature. Now the universe
is preserved, as by the changes of the elements so by the changes
of things compounded of the elements. Let these principles be enough
for thee, let them always be fixed opinions. But cast away the thirst
after books, that thou mayest not die murmuring, but cheerfully, truly,
and from thy heart thankful to the gods. 

Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how
often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost
not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art
a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is
an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou
dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go
and thou wilt go, and it will never return. 

Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast
in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection,
and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other
thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act
of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness
and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy,
and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given
to thee. Thou seest how few the things are, the which if a man lays
hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like
the existence of the gods; for the gods on their part will require
nothing more from him who observes these things. 

Do wrong to thyself, do wrong to thyself, my soul; but thou wilt no
longer have the opportunity of honouring thyself. Every man's life
is sufficient. But thine is nearly finished, though thy soul reverences
not itself but places thy felicity in the souls of others.

Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself
time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around.
But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way. For
those too are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their
activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement,
and, in a word, all their thoughts. 

Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom
been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements
of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy. 

This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole,
and what is my nature, and how this is related to that, and what kind
of a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one
who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are
according to the nature of which thou art a part. 

Theophrastus, in his comparison of bad acts- such a comparison as
one would make in accordance with the common notions of mankind- says,
like a true philosopher, that the offences which are committed through
desire are more blameable than those which are committed through anger.
For he who is excited by anger seems to turn away from reason with
a certain pain and unconscious contraction; but he who offends through
desire, being overpowered by pleasure, seems to be in a manner more
intemperate and more womanish in his offences. Rightly then, and in
a way worthy of philosophy, he said that the offence which is committed
with pleasure is more blameable than that which is committed with
pain; and on the whole the one is more like a person who has been
first wronged and through pain is compelled to be angry; but the other
is moved by his own impulse to do wrong, being carried towards doing
something by desire. 

Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment,
regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among
men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods
will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or
if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live
in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of Providence? But in truth
they do exist, and they do care for human things, and they have put
all the means in man's power to enable him not to fall into real evils.
And as to the rest, if there was anything evil, they would have provided
for this also, that it should be altogether in a man's power not to
fall into it. Now that which does not make a man worse, how can it
make a man's life worse? But neither through ignorance, nor having
the knowledge, but not the power to guard against or correct these
things, is it possible that the nature of the universe has overlooked
them; nor is it possible that it has made so great a mistake, either
through want of power or want of skill, that good and evil should
happen indiscriminately to the good and the bad. But death certainly,
and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, all these things
equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither
better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil.

How quickly all things disappear, in the universe the bodies themselves,
but in time the remembrance of them; what is the nature of all sensible
things, and particularly those which attract with the bait of pleasure
or terrify by pain, or are noised abroad by vapoury fame; how worthless,
and contemptible, and sordid, and perishable, and dead they are- all
this it is the part of the intellectual faculty to observe. To observe
too who these are whose opinions and voices give reputation; what
death is, and the fact that, if a man looks at it in itself, and by
the abstractive power of reflection resolves into their parts all
the things which present themselves to the imagination in it, he will
then consider it to be nothing else than an operation of nature; and
if any one is afraid of an operation of nature, he is a child. This,
however, is not only an operation of nature, but it is also a thing
which conduces to the purposes of nature. To observe too how man comes
near to the deity, and by what part of him, and when this part of
man is so disposed. 

Nothing is more wretched than a man who traverses everything in a
round, and pries into the things beneath the earth, as the poet says,
and seeks by conjecture what is in the minds of his neighbours, without
perceiving that it is sufficient to attend to the daemon within him,
and to reverence it sincerely. And reverence of the daemon consists
in keeping it pure from passion and thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction
with what comes from gods and men. For the things from the gods merit
veneration for their excellence; and the things from men should be
dear to us by reason of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner,
they move our pity by reason of men's ignorance of good and bad; this
defect being not less than that which deprives us of the power of
distinguishing things that are white and black. 

Though thou shouldst be going to live three thousand years, and as
many times ten thousand years, still remember that no man loses any
other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than
this which he now loses. The longest and shortest are thus brought
to the same. For the present is the same to all, though that which
perishes is not the same; and so that which is lost appears to be
a mere moment. For a man cannot lose either the past or the future:
for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him? These
two things then thou must bear in mind; the one, that all things from
eternity are of like forms and come round in a circle, and that it
makes no difference whether a man shall see the same things during
a hundred years or two hundred, or an infinite time; and the second,
that the longest liver and he who will die soonest lose just the same.
For the present is the only thing of which a man can be deprived,
if it is true that this is the only thing which he has, and that a
man cannot lose a thing if he has it not. 

Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus
is manifest: and manifest too is the use of what was said, if a man
receives what may be got out of it as far as it is true.

The soul of man does violence to itself, first of all, when it becomes
an abscess and, as it were, a tumour on the universe, so far as it
can. For to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of
ourselves from nature, in some part of which the natures of all other
things are contained. In the next place, the soul does violence to
itself when it turns away from any man, or even moves towards him
with the intention of injuring, such as are the souls of those who
are angry. In the third place, the soul does violence to itself when
it is overpowered by pleasure or by pain. Fourthly, when it plays
a part, and does or says anything insincerely and untruly. Fifthly,
when it allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an
aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering what
it is, it being right that even the smallest things be done with reference
to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow the reason
and the law of the most ancient city and polity. 

Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux,
and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject
to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine,
and fame a thing devoid of judgement. And, to say all in a word, everything
which belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul
is a dream and vapour, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn,
and after-fame is oblivion. What then is that which is able to conduct
a man? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping
the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior
to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely
and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man's doing or
not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all
that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence
he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind,
as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which
every living being is compounded. But if there is no harm to the elements
themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a
man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all
the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which
is according to nature. 

This in Carnuntum. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK THREE

We ught to consider not only that our life is daily wasting away
and a smaller part of it is left, but another thing also must be taken
into the account, that if a man should live longer, it is quite uncertain
whether the understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension
of things, and retain the power of contemplation which strives to
acquire the knowledge of the divine and the human. For if he shall
begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination
and appetite, and whatever else there is of the kind, will not fail;
but the power of making use of ourselves, and filling up the measure
of our duty, and clearly separating all appearances, and considering
whether a man should now depart from life, and whatever else of the
kind absolutely requires a disciplined reason, all this is already
extinguished. We must make haste then, not only because we are daily
nearer to death, but also because the conception of things and the
understanding of them cease first. 

We ought to observe also that even the things which follow after the
things which are produced according to nature contain something pleasing
and attractive. For instance, when bread is baked some parts are split
at the surface, and these parts which thus open, and have a certain
fashion contrary to the purpose of the baker's art, are beautiful
in a manner, and in a peculiar way excite a desire for eating. And
again, figs, when they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe
olives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds
a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the ears of corn bending down,
and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of
wild boars, and many other things- though they are far from being
beautiful, if a man should examine them severally- still, because
they are consequent upon the things which are formed by nature, help
to adorn them, and they please the mind; so that if a man should have
a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are
produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow
by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner
disposed so as to give pleasure. And so he will see even the real
gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which
painters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and
an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness;
and the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to
look on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves,
not pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar
with nature and her works. 

Hippocrates after curing many diseases himself fell sick and died.
The Chaldaei foretold the deaths of many, and then fate caught them
too. Alexander, and Pompeius, and Caius Caesar, after so often completely
destroying whole cities, and in battle cutting to pieces many ten
thousands of cavalry and infantry, themselves too at last departed
from life. Heraclitus, after so many speculations on the conflagration
of the universe, was filled with water internally and died smeared
all over with mud. And lice destroyed Democritus; and other lice killed
Socrates. What means all this? Thou hast embarked, thou hast made
the voyage, thou art come to shore; get out. If indeed to another
life, there is no want of gods, not even there. But if to a state
without sensation, thou wilt cease to be held by pains and pleasures,
and to be a slave to the vessel, which is as much inferior as that
which serves it is superior: for the one is intelligence and deity;
the other is earth and corruption. 

Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when
thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility.
For thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou
hast such thoughts as these, What is such a person doing, and why,
and what is he saying, and what is he thinking of, and what is he
contriving, and whatever else of the kind makes us wander away from
the observation of our own ruling power. We ought then to check in
the series of our thoughts everything that is without a purpose and
useless, but most of all the over-curious feeling and the malignant;
and a man should use himself to think of those things only about which
if one should suddenly ask, What hast thou now in thy thoughts? With
perfect openness thou mightest, immediately answer, This or That;
so that from thy words it should be plain that everything in thee
is simple and benevolent, and such as befits a social animal, and
one that cares not for thoughts about pleasure or sensual enjoyments
at all, nor has any rivalry or envy and suspicion, or anything else
for which thou wouldst blush if thou shouldst say that thou hadst
it in thy mind. For the man who is such and no longer delays being
among the number of the best, is like a priest and minister of the
gods, using too the deity which is planted within him, which makes
the man uncontaminated by pleasure, unharmed by any pain, untouched
by any insult, feeling no wrong, a fighter in the noblest fight, one
who cannot be overpowered by any passion, dyed deep with justice,
accepting with all his soul everything which happens and is assigned
to him as his portion; and not often, nor yet without great necessity
and for the general interest, imagining what another says, or does,
or thinks. For it is only what belongs to himself that he makes the
matter for his activity; and he constantly thinks of that which is
allotted to himself out of the sum total of things, and he makes his
own acts fair, and he is persuaded that his own portion is good. For
the lot which is assigned to each man is carried along with him and
carries him along with it. And he remembers also that every rational
animal is his kinsman, and that to care for all men is according to
man's nature; and a man should hold on to the opinion not of all,
but of those only who confessedly live according to nature. But as
to those who live not so, he always bears in mind what kind of men
they are both at home and from home, both by night and by day, and
what they are, and with what men they live an impure life. Accordingly,
he does not value at all the praise which comes from such men, since
they are not even satisfied with themselves. 

Labour not unwillingly, nor without regard to the common interest,
nor without due consideration, nor with distraction; nor let studied
ornament set off thy thoughts, and be not either a man of many words,
or busy about too many things. And further, let the deity which is
in thee be the guardian of a living being, manly and of ripe age,
and engaged in matter political, and a Roman, and a ruler, who has
taken his post like a man waiting for the signal which summons him
from life, and ready to go, having need neither of oath nor of any
man's testimony. Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor
the tranquility which others give. A man then must stand erect, not
be kept erect by others. 

If thou findest in human life anything better than justice, truth,
temperance, fortitude, and, in a word, anything better than thy own
mind's self-satisfaction in the things which it enables thee to do
according to right reason, and in the condition that is assigned to
thee without thy own choice; if, I say, thou seest anything better
than this, turn to it with all thy soul, and enjoy that which thou
hast found to be the best. But if nothing appears to be better than
the deity which is planted in thee, which has subjected to itself
all thy appetites, and carefully examines all the impressions, and,
as Socrates said, has detached itself from the persuasions of sense,
and has submitted itself to the gods, and cares for mankind; if thou
findest everything else smaller and of less value than this, give
place to nothing else, for if thou dost once diverge and incline to
it, thou wilt no longer without distraction be able to give the preference
to that good thing which is thy proper possession and thy own; for
it is not right that anything of any other kind, such as praise from
the many, or power, or enjoyment of pleasure, should come into competition
with that which is rationally and politically or practically good.
All these things, even though they may seem to adapt themselves to
the better things in a small degree, obtain the superiority all at
once, and carry us away. But do thou, I say, simply and freely choose
the better, and hold to it.- But that which is useful is the better.-
Well then, if it is useful to thee as a rational being, keep to it;
but if it is only useful to thee as an animal, say so, and maintain
thy judgement without arrogance: only take care that thou makest the
inquiry by a sure method. 

Never value anything as profitable to thyself which shall compel thee
to break thy promise, to lose thy self-respect, to hate any man, to
suspect, to curse, to act the hypocrite, to desire anything which
needs walls and curtains: for he who has preferred to everything intelligence
and daemon and the worship of its excellence, acts no tragic part,
does not groan, will not need either solitude or much company; and,
what is chief of all, he will live without either pursuing or flying
from death; but whether for a longer or a shorter time he shall have
the soul inclosed in the body, he cares not at all: for even if he
must depart immediately, he will go as readily as if he were going
to do anything else which can be done with decency and order; taking
care of this only all through life, that his thoughts turn not away
from anything which belongs to an intelligent animal and a member
of a civil community. 

In the mind of one who is chastened and purified thou wilt find no
corrupt matter, nor impurity, nor any sore skinned over. Nor is his
life incomplete when fate overtakes him, as one may say of an actor
who leaves the stage before ending and finishing the play. Besides,
there is in him nothing servile, nor affected, nor too closely bound
to other things, nor yet detached from other things, nothing worthy
of blame, nothing which seeks a hiding-place. 

Reverence the faculty which produces opinion. On this faculty it entirely
depends whether there shall exist in thy ruling part any opinion inconsistent
with nature and the constitution of the rational animal. And this
faculty promises freedom from hasty judgement, and friendship towards
men, and obedience to the gods. 

Throwing away then all things, hold to these only which are few; and
besides bear in mind that every man lives only this present time,
which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is
either past or it is uncertain. Short then is the time which every
man lives, and small the nook of the earth where he lives; and short
too the longest posthumous fame, and even this only continued by a
succession of poor human beings, who will very soon die, and who know
not even themselves, much less him who died long ago. 

To the aids which have been mentioned let this one still be added:-
Make for thyself a definition or description of the thing which is
presented to thee, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it
is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and
tell thyself its proper name, and the names of the things of which
it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing
is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically
and truly every object which is presented to thee in life, and always
to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe
this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what
value everything has with reference to the whole, and what with reference
to man, who is a citizen of the highest city, of which all other cities
are like families; what each thing is, and of what it is composed,
and how long it is the nature of this thing to endure which now makes
an impression on me, and what virtue I have need of with respect to
it, such as gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment,
and the rest. Wherefore, on every occasion a man should say: this
comes from God; and this is according to the apportionment and spinning
of the thread of destiny, and such-like coincidence and chance; and
this is from one of the same stock, and a kinsman and partner, one
who knows not however what is according to his nature. But I know;
for this reason I behave towards him according to the natural law
of fellowship with benevolence and justice. At the same time however
in things indifferent I attempt to ascertain the value of each.

If thou workest at that which is before thee, following right reason
seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract
thee, but keeping thy divine part pure, as if thou shouldst be bound
to give it back immediately; if thou holdest to this, expecting nothing,
fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according
to nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou
utterest, thou wilt live happy. And there is no man who is able to
prevent this. 

As physicians have always their instruments and knives ready for cases
which suddenly require their skill, so do thou have principles ready
for the understanding of things divine and human, and for doing everything,
even the smallest, with a recollection of the bond which unites the
divine and human to one another. For neither wilt thou do anything
well which pertains to man without at the same time having a reference
to things divine; nor the contrary. 

No longer wander at hazard; for neither wilt thou read thy own memoirs,
nor the acts of the ancient Romans and Hellenes, and the selections
from books which thou wast reserving for thy old age. Hasten then
to the end which thou hast before thee, and throwing away idle hopes,
come to thy own aid, if thou carest at all for thyself, while it is
in thy power. 

They know not how many things are signified by the words stealing,
sowing, buying, keeping quiet, seeing what ought to be done; for this
is not effected by the eyes, but by another kind of vision.

Body, soul, intelligence: to the body belong sensations, to the soul
appetites, to the intelligence principles. To receive the impressions
of forms by means of appearances belongs even to animals; to be pulled
by the strings of desire belongs both to wild beasts and to men who
have made themselves into women, and to a Phalaris and a Nero: and
to have the intelligence that guides to the things which appear suitable
belongs also to those who do not believe in the gods, and who betray
their country, and do their impure deeds when they have shut the doors.
If then everything else is common to all that I have mentioned, there
remains that which is peculiar to the good man, to be pleased and
content with what happens, and with the thread which is spun for him;
and not to defile the divinity which is planted in his breast, nor
disturb it by a crowd of images, but to preserve it tranquil, following
it obediently as a god, neither saying anything contrary to the truth,
nor doing anything contrary to justice. And if all men refuse to believe
that he lives a simple, modest, and contented life, he is neither
angry with any of them, nor does he deviate from the way which leads
to the end of life, to which a man ought to come pure, tranquil, ready
to depart, and without any compulsion perfectly reconciled to his
lot.

BOOK FOUR

That which rules within, when it is according to nature, is so affected
with respect to the events which happen, that it always easily adapts
itself to that which is and is presented to it. For it requires no
definite material, but it moves towards its purpose, under certain
conditions however; and it makes a material for itself out of that
which opposes it, as fire lays hold of what falls into it, by which
a small light would have been extinguished: but when the fire is strong,
it soon appropriates to itself the matter which is heaped on it, and
consumes it, and rises higher by means of this very material.

Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according
to the perfect principles of art. 

Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores,
and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much.
But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for
it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself.
For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does
a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within
him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect
tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the
good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat,
and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental,
which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to
cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent
with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art thou discontented?
With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that
rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part
of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider how
many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting,
have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.-
But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee
out of the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative;
either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things;
or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world
is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps
corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- Consider then further
that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or
violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its
own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented
to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps the
desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See how soon everything
is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side
of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness
and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the
narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet
at last. For the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it
is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of
people are they who will praise thee. 

This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory of
thy own, and above all do not distract or strain thyself, but be free,
and look at things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a
mortal. But among the things readiest to thy hand to which thou shalt
turn, let there be these, which are two. One is that things do not
touch the soul, for they are external and remain immovable; but our
perturbations come only from the opinion which is within. The other
is that all these things, which thou seest, change immediately and
will no longer be; and constantly bear in mind how many of these changes
thou hast already witnessed. The universe is transformation: life
is opinion. 

If our intellectual part is common, the reason also, in respect of
which we are rational beings, is common: if this is so, common also
is the reason which commands us what to do, and what not to do; if
this is so, there is a common law also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens;
if this is so, we are members of some political community; if this
is so, the world is in a manner a state. For of what other common
political community will any one say that the whole human race are
members? And from thence, from this common political community comes
also our very intellectual faculty and reasoning faculty and our capacity
for law; or whence do they come? For as my earthly part is a portion
given to me from certain earth, and that which is watery from another
element, and that which is hot and fiery from some peculiar source
(for nothing comes out of that which is nothing, as nothing also returns
to non-existence), so also the intellectual part comes from some source.

Death is such as generation is, a mystery of nature; a composition
out of the same elements, and a decomposition into the same; and altogether
not a thing of which any man should be ashamed, for it is not contrary
to the nature of a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason
of our constitution. 

It is natural that these things should be done by such persons, it
is a matter of necessity; and if a man will not have it so, he will
not allow the fig-tree to have juice. But by all means bear this in
mind, that within a very short time both thou and he will be dead;
and soon not even your names will be left behind. 

Take away thy opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint,
"I have been harmed." Take away the complaint, "I have been harmed,"
and the harm is taken away. 

That which does not make a man worse than he was, also does not make
his life worse, nor does it harm him either from without or from within.

The nature of that which is universally useful has been compelled
to do this. 

Consider that everything which happens, happens justly, and if thou
observest carefully, thou wilt find it to be so. I do not say only
with respect to the continuity of the series of things, but with respect
to what is just, and as if it were done by one who assigns to each
thing its value. Observe then as thou hast begun; and whatever thou
doest, do it in conjunction with this, the being good, and in the
sense in which a man is properly understood to be good. Keep to this
in every action. 

Do not have such an opinion of things as he has who does thee wrong,
or such as he wishes thee to have, but look at them as they are in
truth. 

A man should always have these two rules in readiness; the one, to
do only whatever the reason of the ruling and legislating faculty
may suggest for the use of men; the other, to change thy opinion,
if there is any one at hand who sets thee right and moves thee from
any opinion. But this change of opinion must proceed only from a certain
persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage, and the like,
not because it appears pleasant or brings reputation. 

Hast thou reason? I have.- Why then dost not thou use it? For if this
does its own work, what else dost thou wish? 

Thou hast existed as a part. Thou shalt disappear in that which produced
thee; but rather thou shalt be received back into its seminal principle
by transmutation. 

Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another
falls after; but it makes no difference. 

Within ten days thou wilt seem a god to those to whom thou art now
a beast and an ape, if thou wilt return to thy principles and the
worship of reason. 

Do not act as if thou wert going to live ten thousand years. Death
hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be good.

How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbour
says or does or thinks, but only to what he does himself, that it
may be just and pure; or as Agathon says, look not round at the depraved
morals of others, but run straight along the line without deviating
from it. 

He who has a vehement desire for posthumous fame does not consider
that every one of those who remember him will himself also die very
soon; then again also they who have succeeded them, until the whole
remembrance shall have been extinguished as it is transmitted through
men who foolishly admire and perish. But suppose that those who will
remember are even immortal, and that the remembrance will be immortal,
what then is this to thee? And I say not what is it to the dead, but
what is it to the living? What is praise except indeed so far as it
has a certain utility? For thou now rejectest unseasonably the gift
of nature, clinging to something else... 

Everything which is in any way beautiful is beautiful in itself, and
terminates in itself, not having praise as part of itself. Neither
worse then nor better is a thing made by being praised. I affirm this
also of the things which are called beautiful by the vulgar, for example,
material things and works of art. That which is really beautiful has
no need of anything; not more than law, not more than truth, not more
than benevolence or modesty. Which of these things is beautiful because
it is praised, or spoiled by being blamed? Is such a thing as an emerald
made worse than it was, if it is not praised? Or gold, ivory, purple,
a lyre, a little knife, a flower, a shrub? 

If souls continue to exist, how does the air contain them from eternity?-
But how does the earth contain the bodies of those who have been buried
from time so remote? For as here the mutation of these bodies after
a certain continuance, whatever it may be, and their dissolution make
room for other dead bodies; so the souls which are removed into the
air after subsisting for some time are transmuted and diffused, and
assume a fiery nature by being received into the seminal intelligence
of the universe, and in this way make room for the fresh souls which
come to dwell there. And this is the answer which a man might give
on the hypothesis of souls continuing to exist. But we must not only
think of the number of bodies which are thus buried, but also of the
number of animals which are daily eaten by us and the other animals.
For what a number is consumed, and thus in a manner buried in the
bodies of those who feed on them! And nevertheless this earth receives
them by reason of the changes of these bodies into blood, and the
transformations into the aerial or the fiery element. 

What is the investigation into the truth in this matter? The division
into that which is material and that which is the cause of form, the
formal. 

Do not be whirled about, but in every movement have respect to justice,
and on the occasion of every impression maintain the faculty of comprehension
or understanding. 

Everything harmonizes with me, which is harmonious to thee, O Universe.
Nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in due time for
thee. Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, O Nature:
from thee are all things, in thee are all things, to thee all things
return. The poet says, Dear city of Cecrops; and wilt not thou say,
Dear city of Zeus? 

Occupy thyself with few things, says the philosopher, if thou wouldst
be tranquil.- But consider if it would not be better to say, Do what
is necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is naturally
social requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the
tranquility which comes from doing well, but also that which comes
from doing few things. For the greatest part of what we say and do
being unnecessary, if a man takes this away, he will have more leisure
and less uneasiness. Accordingly on every occasion a man should ask
himself, Is this one of the unnecessary things? Now a man should take
away not only unnecessary acts, but also, unnecessary thoughts, for
thus superfluous acts will not follow after. 

Try how the life of the good man suits thee, the life of him who is
satisfied with his portion out of the whole, and satisfied with his
own just acts and benevolent disposition. 

Hast thou seen those things? Look also at these. Do not disturb thyself.
Make thyself all simplicity. Does any one do wrong? It is to himself
that he does the wrong. Has anything happened to thee? Well; out of
the universe from the beginning everything which happens has been
apportioned and spun out to thee. In a word, thy life is short. Thou
must turn to profit the present by the aid of reason and justice.
Be sober in thy relaxation. 

Either it is a well-arranged universe or a chaos huddled together,
but still a universe. But can a certain order subsist in thee, and
disorder in the All? And this too when all things are so separated
and diffused and sympathetic. 

A black character, a womanish character, a stubborn character, bestial,
childish, animal, stupid, counterfeit, scurrilous, fraudulent, tyrannical.

If he is a stranger to the universe who does not know what is in it,
no less is he a stranger who does not know what is going on in it.
He is a runaway, who flies from social reason; he is blind, who shuts
the eyes of the understanding; he is poor, who has need of another,
and has not from himself all things which are useful for life. He
is an abscess on the universe who withdraws and separates himself
from the reason of our common nature through being displeased with
the things which happen, for the same nature produces this, and has
produced thee too: he is a piece rent asunder from the state, who
tears his own soul from that of reasonable animals, which is one.

The one is a philosopher without a tunic, and the other without a
book: here is another half naked: Bread I have not, he says, and I
abide by reason.- And I do not get the means of living out of my learning,
and I abide by my reason. 

Love the art, poor as it may be, which thou hast learned, and be content
with it; and pass through the rest of life like one who has intrusted
to the gods with his whole soul all that he has, making thyself neither
the tyrant nor the slave of any man. 

Consider, for example, the times of Vespasian. Thou wilt see all these
things, people marrying, bringing up children, sick, dying, warring,
feasting, trafficking, cultivating the ground, flattering, obstinately
arrogant, suspecting, plotting, wishing for some to die, grumbling
about the present, loving, heaping up treasure, desiring counsulship,
kingly power. Well then, that life of these people no longer exists
at all. Again, remove to the times of Trajan. Again, all is the same.
Their life too is gone. In like manner view also the other epochs
of time and of whole nations, and see how many after great efforts
soon fell and were resolved into the elements. But chiefly thou shouldst
think of those whom thou hast thyself known distracting themselves
about idle things, neglecting to do what was in accordance with their
proper constitution, and to hold firmly to this and to be content
with it. And herein it is necessary to remember that the attention
given to everything has its proper value and proportion. For thus
thou wilt not be dissatisfied, if thou appliest thyself to smaller
matters no further than is fit. 

The words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also
the names of those who were famed of old, are now in a manner antiquated,
Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Leonnatus, and a little after also Scipio
and Cato, then Augustus, then also Hadrian and Antoninus. For all
things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion
soon buries them. And I say this of those who have shone in a wondrous
way. For the rest, as soon as they have breathed out their breath,
they are gone, and no man speaks of them. And, to conclude the matter,
what is even an eternal remembrance? A mere nothing. What then is
that about which we ought to employ our serious pains? This one thing,
thoughts just, and acts social, and words which never lie, and a disposition
which gladly accepts all that happens, as necessary, as usual, as
flowing from a principle and source of the same kind. 

Willingly give thyself up to Clotho, one of the Fates, allowing her
to spin thy thread into whatever things she pleases. 

Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which
is remembered. 

Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom
thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing
so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like
them. For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which
will be. But thou art thinking only of seeds which are cast into the
earth or into a womb: but this is a very vulgar notion. 

Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, not free from perturbations,
nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly
disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in acting
justly. 

Examine men's ruling principles, even those of the wise, what kind
of things they avoid, and what kind they pursue. 

What is evil to thee does not subsist in the ruling principle of another;
nor yet in any turning and mutation of thy corporeal covering. Where
is it then? It is in that part of thee in which subsists the power
of forming opinions about evils. Let this power then not form such
opinions, and all is well. And if that which is nearest to it, the
poor body, is burnt, filled with matter and rottenness, nevertheless
let the part which forms opinions about these things be quiet, that
is, let it judge that nothing is either bad or good which can happen
equally to the bad man and the good. For that which happens equally
to him who lives contrary to nature and to him who lives according
to nature, is neither according to nature nor contrary to nature.

Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance
and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception,
the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with
one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all
things which exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread
and the contexture of the web. 

Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to
say. 

It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things
to subsist in consequence of change. 

Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent
stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away,
and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.

Everything which happens is as familiar and well known as the rose
in spring and the fruit in summer; for such is disease, and death,
and calumny, and treachery, and whatever else delights fools or vexes
them. 

In the series of things those which follow are always aptly fitted
to those which have gone before; for this series is not like a mere
enumeration of disjointed things, which has only a necessary sequence,
but it is a rational connection: and as all existing things are arranged
together harmoniously, so the things which come into existence exhibit
no mere succession, but a certain wonderful relationship.

Always remember the saying of Heraclitus, that the death of earth
is to become water, and the death of water is to become air, and the
death of air is to become fire, and reversely. And think too of him
who forgets whither the way leads, and that men quarrel with that
with which they are most constantly in communion, the reason which
governs the universe; and the things which daily meet with seem to
them strange: and consider that we ought not to act and speak as if
we were asleep, for even in sleep we seem to act and speak; and that
we ought not, like children who learn from their parents, simply to
act and speak as we have been taught. 

If any god told thee that thou shalt die to-morrow, or certainly on
the day after to-morrow, thou wouldst not care much whether it was
on the third day or on the morrow, unless thou wast in the highest
degree mean-spirited- for how small is the difference?- So think it
no great thing to die after as many years as thou canst name rather
than to-morrow. 

Think continually how many physicians are dead after often contracting
their eyebrows over the sick; and how many astrologers after predicting
with great pretensions the deaths of others; and how many philosophers
after endless discourses on death or immortality; how many heroes
after killing thousands; and how many tyrants who have used their
power over men's lives with terrible insolence as if they were immortal;
and how many cities are entirely dead, so to speak, Helice and Pompeii
and Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Add to the reckoning all
whom thou hast known, one after another. One man after burying another
has been laid out dead, and another buries him: and all this in a
short time. To conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless
human things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus to-morrow
will be a mummy or ashes. Pass then through this little space of time
conformably to nature, and end thy journey in content, just as an
olive falls off when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced it,
and thanking the tree on which it grew. 

Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break,
but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.

Unhappy am I because this has happened to me.- Not so, but happy am
I, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain,
neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future. For such a
thing as this might have happened to every man; but every man would
not have continued free from pain on such an occasion. Why then is
that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune? And dost thou in
all cases call that a man's misfortune, which is not a deviation from
man's nature? And does a thing seem to thee to be a deviation from
man's nature, when it is not contrary to the will of man's nature?
Well, thou knowest the will of nature. Will then this which has happened
prevent thee from being just, magnanimous, temperate, prudent, secure
against inconsiderate opinions and falsehood; will it prevent thee
from having modesty, freedom, and everything else, by the presence
of which man's nature obtains all that is its own? Remember too on
every occasion which leads thee to vexation to apply this principle:
not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune.

It is a vulgar, but still a useful help towards contempt of death,
to pass in review those who have tenaciously stuck to life. What more
then have they gained than those who have died early? Certainly they
lie in their tombs somewhere at last, Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus,
Lepidus, or any one else like them, who have carried out many to be
buried, and then were carried out themselves. Altogether the interval
is small between birth and death; and consider with how much trouble,
and in company with what sort of people and in what a feeble body
this interval is laboriously passed. Do not then consider life a thing
of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and to
the time which is before thee, another boundless space. In this infinity
then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him
who lives three generations? 

Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: accordingly
say and do everything in conformity with the soundest reason. For
such a purpose frees a man from trouble, and warfare, and all artifice
and ostentatious display.

BOOK FIVE

In he morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present-
I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied
if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was
brought into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie in the
bed-clothes and keep myself warm?- But this is more pleasant.- Dost
thou exist then to take thy pleasure, and not at all for action or
exertion? Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the
ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order their
several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do the work
of a human being, and dost thou not make haste to do that which is
according to thy nature?- But it is necessary to take rest also.-
It is necessary: however nature has fixed bounds to this too: she
has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond
these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy acts it is not
so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do. So thou lovest
not thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst love thy nature and her
will. But those who love their several arts exhaust themselves in
working at them unwashed and without food; but thou valuest thy own
own nature less than the turner values the turning art, or the dancer
the dancing art, or the lover of money values his money, or the vainglorious
man his little glory. And such men, when they have a violent affection
to a thing, choose neither to eat nor to sleep rather than to perfect
the things which they care for. But are the acts which concern society
more vile in thy eyes and less worthy of thy labour? 

How easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which is
troublesome or unsuitable, and immediately to be in all tranquility.

Judge every word and deed which are according to nature to be fit
for thee; and be not diverted by the blame which follows from any
people nor by their words, but if a thing is good to be done or said,
do not consider it unworthy of thee. For those persons have their
peculiar leading principle and follow their peculiar movement; which
things do not thou regard, but go straight on, following thy own nature
and the common nature; and the way of both is one. 

I go through the things which happen according to nature until I shall
fall and rest, breathing out my breath into that element out of which
I daily draw it in, and falling upon that earth out of which my father
collected the seed, and my mother the blood, and my nurse the milk;
out of which during so many years I have been supplied with food and
drink; which bears me when I tread on it and abuse it for so many
purposes. 

Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits.- Be it so:
but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am
not formed for them by nature. Show those qualities then which are
altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour,
aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things,
benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling
magnanimity. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately
able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity
and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the
mark? Or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by
nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault
with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display,
and to be so restless in thy mind? No, by the gods: but thou mightest
have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou
canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension,
thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet
taking pleasure in thy dulness. 

One man, when he has done a service to another, is ready to set it
down to his account as a favour conferred. Another is not ready to
do this, but still in his own mind he thinks of the man as his debtor,
and he knows what he has done. A third in a manner does not even know
what he has done, but he is like a vine which has produced grapes,
and seeks for nothing more after it has once produced its proper fruit.
As a horse when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the game, a
bee when it has made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act,
does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another
act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.- Must
a man then be one of these, who in a manner act thus without observing
it?- Yes.- But this very thing is necessary, the observation of what
a man is doing: for, it may be said, it is characteristic of the social
animal to perceive that he is working in a social manner, and indeed
to wish that his social partner also should perceive it.- It is true
what thou sayest, but thou dost not rightly understand what is now
said: and for this reason thou wilt become one of those of whom I
spoke before, for even they are misled by a certain show of reason.
But if thou wilt choose to understand the meaning of what is said,
do not fear that for this reason thou wilt omit any social act.

A prayer of the Athenians: Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, down on the ploughed
fields of the Athenians and on the plains.- In truth we ought not
to pray at all, or we ought to pray in this simple and noble fashion.

Just as we must understand when it is said, That Aesculapius prescribed
to this man horse-exercise, or bathing in cold water or going without
shoes; so we must understand it when it is said, That the nature of
the universe prescribed to this man disease or mutilation or loss
or anything else of the kind. For in the first case Prescribed means
something like this: he prescribed this for this man as a thing adapted
to procure health; and in the second case it means: That which happens
to (or, suits) every man is fixed in a manner for him suitably to
his destiny. For this is what we mean when we say that things are
suitable to us, as the workmen say of squared stones in walls or the
pyramids, that they are suitable, when they fit them to one another
in some kind of connexion. For there is altogether one fitness, harmony.
And as the universe is made up out of all bodies to be such a body
as it is, so out of all existing causes necessity (destiny) is made
up to be such a cause as it is. And even those who are completely
ignorant understand what I mean, for they say, It (necessity, destiny)
brought this to such a person.- This then was brought and this was
precribed to him. Let us then receive these things, as well as those
which Aesculapius prescribes. Many as a matter of course even among
his prescriptions are disagreeable, but we accept them in the hope
of health. Let the perfecting and accomplishment of the things, which
the common nature judges to be good, be judged by thee to be of the
same kind as thy health. And so accept everything which happens, even
if it seem disagreeable, because it leads to this, to the health of
the universe and to the prosperity and felicity of Zeus (the universe).
For he would not have brought on any man what he has brought, if it
were not useful for the whole. Neither does the nature of anything,
whatever it may be, cause anything which is not suitable to that which
is directed by it. For two reasons then it is right to be content
with that which happens to thee; the one, because it was done for
thee and prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee,
originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy destiny; and
the other, because even that which comes severally to every man is
to the power which administers the universe a cause of felicity and
perfection, nay even of its very continuance. For the integrity of
the whole is mutilated, if thou cuttest off anything whatever from
the conjunction and the continuity either of the parts or of the causes.
And thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy power, when thou art
dissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out of the way.

Be not disgusted, nor discouraged, nor dissatisfied, if thou dost
not succeed in doing everything according to right principles; but
when thou bast failed, return back again, and be content if the greater
part of what thou doest is consistent with man's nature, and love
this to which thou returnest; and do not return to philosophy as if
she were a master, but act like those who have sore eyes and apply
a bit of sponge and egg, or as another applies a plaster, or drenching
with water. For thus thou wilt not fail to obey reason, and thou wilt
repose in it. And remember that philosophy requires only the things
which thy nature requires; but thou wouldst have something else which
is not according to nature.- It may be objected, Why what is more
agreeable than this which I am doing?- But is not this the very reason
why pleasure deceives us? And consider if magnanimity, freedom, simplicity,
equanimity, piety, are not more agreeable. For what is more agreeable
than wisdom itself, when thou thinkest of the security and the happy
course of all things which depend on the faculty of understanding
and knowledge? 

Things are in such a kind of envelopment that they have seemed to
philosophers, not a few nor those common philosophers, altogether
unintelligible; nay even to the Stoics themselves they seem difficult
to understand. And all our assent is changeable; for where is the
man who never changes? Carry thy thoughts then to the objects themselves,
and consider how short-lived they are and worthless, and that they
may be in the possession of a filthy wretch or a whore or a robber.
Then turn to the morals of those who live with thee, and it is hardly
possible to endure even the most agreeable of them, to say nothing
of a man being hardly able to endure himself. In such darkness then
and dirt and in so constant a flux both of substance and of time,
and of motion and of things moved, what there is worth being highly
prized or even an object of serious pursuit, I cannot imagine. But
on the contrary it is a man's duty to comfort himself, and to wait
for the 

natural dissolution and not to be vexed at the delay, but to rest
in these principles only: the one, that nothing will happen to me
which is not conformable to the nature of the universe; and the other,
that it is in my power never to act contrary to my god and daemon:
for there is no man who will compel me to this. 

About what am I now employing my own soul? On every occasion I must
ask myself this question, and inquire, what have I now in this part
of me which they call the ruling principle? And whose soul have I
now? That of a child, or of a young man, or of a feeble woman, or
of a tyrant, or of a domestic animal, or of a wild beast?

What kind of things those are which appear good to the many, we may
learn even from this. For if any man should conceive certain things
as being really good, such as prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude,
he would not after having first conceived these endure to listen to
anything which should not be in harmony with what is really good.
But if a man has first conceived as good the things which appear to
the many to be good, he will listen and readily receive as very applicable
that which was said by the comic writer. Thus even the many perceive
the difference. For were it not so, this saying would not offend and
would not be rejected in the first case, while we receive it when
it is said of wealth, and of the means which further luxury and fame,
as said fitly and wittily. Go on then and ask if we should value and
think those things to be good, to which after their first conception
in the mind the words of the comic writer might be aptly applied-
that he who has them, through pure abundance has not a place to ease
himself in. 

I am composed of the formal and the material; and neither of them
will perish into non-existence, as neither of them came into existence
out of non-existence. Every part of me then will be reduced by change
into some part of the universe, and that again will change into another
part of the universe, and so on for ever. And by consequence of such
a change I too exist, and those who begot me, and so on for ever in
the other direction. For nothing hinders us from saying so, even if
the universe is administered according to definite periods of revolution.

Reason and the reasoning art (philosophy) are powers which are sufficient
for themselves and for their own works. They move then from a first
principle which is their own, and they make their way to the end which
is proposed to them; and this is the reason why such acts are named
catorthoseis or right acts, which word signifies that they proceed
by the right road. 

None of these things ought to be called a man's, which do not belong
to a man, as man. They are not required of a man, nor does man's nature
promise them, nor are they the means of man's nature attaining its
end. Neither then does the end of man lie in these things, nor yet
that which aids to the accomplishment of this end, and that which
aids towards this end is that which is good. Besides, if any of these
things did belong to man, it would not be right for a man to despise
them and to set himself against them; nor would a man be worthy of
praise who showed that he did not want these things, nor would he
who stinted himself in any of them be good, if indeed these things
were good. But now the more of these things a man deprives himself
of, or of other things like them, or even when he is deprived of any
of them, the more patiently he endures the loss, just in the same
degree he is a better man. 

Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character
of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with
a continuous series of such thoughts as these: for instance, that
where a man can live, there he can also live well. But he must live
in a palace;- well then, he can also live well in a palace. And again,
consider that for whatever purpose each thing has been constituted,
for this it has been constituted, and towards this it is carried;
and its end is in that towards which it is carried; and where the
end is, there also is the advantage and the good of each thing. Now
the good for the reasonable animal is society; for that we are made
for society has been shown above. Is it not plain that the inferior
exist for the sake of the superior? But the things which have life
are superior to those which have not life, and of those which have
life the superior are those which have reason. 

To seek what is impossible is madness: and it is impossible that the
bad should not do something of this kind. 

Nothing happens to any man which he is not formed by nature to bear.
The same things happen to another, and either because he does not
see that they have happened or because he would show a great spirit
he is firm and remains unharmed. It is a shame then that ignorance
and conceit should be stronger than wisdom. 

Things themselves touch not the soul, not in the least degree; nor
have they admission to the soul, nor can they turn or move the soul:
but the soul turns and moves itself alone, and whatever judgements
it may think proper to make, such it makes for itself the things which
present themselves to it. 

In one respect man is the nearest thing to me, so far as I must do
good to men and endure them. But so far as some men make themselves
obstacles to my proper acts, man becomes to me one of the things which
are indifferent, no less than the sun or wind or a wild beast. Now
it is true that these may impede my action, but they are no impediments
to my affects and disposition, which have the power of acting conditionally
and changing: for the mind converts and changes every hindrance to
its activity into an aid; and so that which is a hindrance is made
a furtherance to an act; and that which is an obstacle on the road
helps us on this road. 

Reverence that which is best in the universe; and this is that which
makes use of all things and directs all things. And in like manner
also reverence that which is best in thyself; and this is of the same
kind as that. For in thyself also, that which makes use of everything
else, is this, and thy life is directed by this. 

That which does no harm to the state, does no harm to the citizen.
In the case of every appearance of harm apply this rule: if the state
is not harmed by this, neither am I harmed. But if the state is harmed,
thou must not be angry with him who does harm to the state. Show him
where his error is. 

Often think of the rapidity with which things pass by and disappear,
both the things which are and the things which are produced. For substance
is like a river in a continual flow, and the activities of things
are in constant change, and the causes work in infinite varieties;
and there is hardly anything which stands still. And consider this
which is near to thee, this boundless abyss of the past and of the
future in which all things disappear. How then is he not a fool who
is puffed up with such things or plagued about them and makes himself
miserable? for they vex him only for a time, and a short time.

Think of the universal substance, of which thou hast a very small
portion; and of universal time, of which a short and indivisible interval
has been assigned to thee; and of that which is fixed by destiny,
and how small a part of it thou art. 

Does another do me wrong? Let him look to it. He has his own disposition,
his own activity. I now have what the universal nature wills me to
have; and I do what my nature now wills me to do. 

Let the part of thy soul which leads and governs be undisturbed by
the movements in the flesh, whether of pleasure or of pain; and let
it not unite with them, but let it circumscribe itself and limit those
affects to their parts. But when these affects rise up to the mind
by virtue of that other sympathy that naturally exists in a body which
is all one, then thou must not strive to resist the sensation, for
it is natural: but let not the ruling part of itself add to the sensation
the opinion that it is either good or bad. 

Live with the gods. And he does live with the gods who constantly
shows to them, his own soul is satisfied with that which is assigned
to him, and that it does all that the daemon wishes, which Zeus hath
given to every man for his guardian and guide, a portion of himself.
And this is every man's understanding and reason. 

Art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? Art thou angry with him
whose mouth smells foul? What good will this danger do thee? He has
such a mouth, he has such arm-pits: it is necessary that such an emanation
must come from such things- but the man has reason, it will be said,
and he is able, if he takes pain, to discover wherein he offends-
I wish thee well of thy discovery. Well then, and thou hast reason:
by thy rational faculty stir up his rational faculty; show him his
error, admonish him. For if he listens, thou wilt cure him, and there
is no need of anger. Neither tragic actor nor whore... 

As thou intendest to live when thou art gone out,...so it is in thy
power to live here. But if men do not permit thee, then get away out
of life, yet so as if thou wert suffering no harm. The house is smoky,
and I quit it. Why dost thou think that this is any trouble? But so
long as nothing of the kind drives me out, I remain, am free, and
no man shall hinder me from doing what I choose; and I choose to do
what is according to the nature of the rational and social animal.

The intelligence of the universe is social. Accordingly it has made
the inferior things for the sake of the superior, and it has fitted
the superior to one another. Thou seest how it has subordinated, co-ordinated
and assigned to everything its proper portion, and has brought together
into concord with one another the things which are the best.

How hast thou behaved hitherto to the gods, thy parents, brethren,
children, teachers, to those who looked after thy infancy, to thy
friends, kinsfolk, to thy slaves? Consider if thou hast hitherto behaved
to all in such a way that this may be said of thee: 

Never has wronged a man in deed or word. And call to recollection
both how many things thou hast passed through, and how many things
thou hast been able to endure: and that the history of thy life is
now complete and thy service is ended: and how many beautiful things
thou hast seen: and how many pleasures and pains thou hast despised;
and how many things called honourable thou hast spurned; and to how
many ill-minded folks thou hast shown a kind disposition.

Why do unskilled and ignorant souls disturb him who has skill and
knowledge? What soul then has skill and knowledge? That which knows
beginning and end, and knows the reason which pervades all substance
and through all time by fixed periods (revolutions) administers the
universe. 

Soon, very soon, thou wilt be ashes, or a skeleton, and either a name
or not even a name; but name is sound and echo. And the things which
are much valued in life are empty and rotten and trifling, and like
little dogs biting one another, and little children quarrelling, laughing,
and then straightway weeping. But fidelity and modesty and justice
and truth are fled 

Up to Olympus from the wide-spread earth. What then is there which
still detains thee here? If the objects of sense are easily changed
and never stand still, and the organs of perception are dull and easily
receive false impressions; and the poor soul itself is an exhalation
from blood. But to have good repute amidst such a world as this is
an empty thing. Why then dost thou not wait in tranquility for thy
end, whether it is extinction or removal to another state? And until
that time comes, what is sufficient? Why, what else than to venerate
the gods and bless them, and to do good to men, and to practise tolerance
and self-restraint; but as to everything which is beyond the limits
of the poor flesh and breath, to remember that this is neither thine
nor in thy power. 

Thou canst pass thy life in an equable flow of happiness, if thou
canst go by the right way, and think and act in the right way. These
two things are common both to the soul of God and to the soul of man,
and to the soul of every rational being, not to be hindered by another;
and to hold good to consist in the disposition to justice and the
practice of it, and in this to let thy desire find its termination.

If this is neither my own badness, nor an effect of my own badness,
and the common weal is not injured, why am I troubled about it? And
what is the harm to the common weal? 

Do not be carried along inconsiderately by the appearance of things,
but give help to all according to thy ability and their fitness; and
if they should have sustained loss in matters which are indifferent,
do not imagine this to be a damage. For it is a bad habit. But as
the old man, when he went away, asked back his foster-child's top,
remembering that it was a top, so do thou in this case also.

When thou art calling out on the Rostra, hast thou forgotten, man,
what these things are?- Yes; but they are objects of great concern
to these people- wilt thou too then be made a fool for these things?-
I was once a fortunate man, but I lost it, I know not how.- But fortunate
means that a man has assigned to himself a good fortune: and a good
fortune is good disposition of the soul, good emotions, good actions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK SIX

The substance of the universe is obedient and compliant; and the
reason which governs it has in itself no cause for doing evil, for
it has no malice, nor does it do evil to anything, nor is anything
harmed by it. But all things are made and perfected according to this
reason. 

Let it make no difference to thee whether thou art cold or warm, if
thou art doing thy duty; and whether thou art drowsy or satisfied
with sleep; and whether ill-spoken of or praised; and whether dying
or doing something else. For it is one of the acts of life, this act
by which we die: it is sufficient then in this act also to do well
what we have in hand. 

Look within. Let neither the peculiar quality of anything nor its
value escape thee. 

All existing things soon change, and they will either be reduced to
vapour, if indeed all substance is one, or they will be dispersed.

The reason which governs knows what its own disposition is, and what
it does, and on what material it works. 

The best way of avenging thyself is not to become like the wrong doer.

Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it, in passing from one social
act to another social act, thinking of God. 

The ruling principle is that which rouses and turns itself, and while
it makes itself such as it is and such as it wills to be, it also
makes everything which happens appear to itself to be such as it wills.

In conformity to the nature of the universe every single thing is
accomplished, for certainly it is not in conformity to any other nature
that each thing is accomplished, either a nature which externally
comprehends this, or a nature which is comprehended within this nature,
or a nature external and independent of this. 

The universe is either a confusion, and a mutual involution of things,
and a dispersion; or it is unity and order and providence. If then
it is the former, why do I desire to tarry in a fortuitous combination
of things and such a disorder? And why do I care about anything else
than how I shall at last become earth? And why am I disturbed, for
the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I do. But if the
other supposition is true, I venerate, and I am firm, and I trust
in him who governs. 

When thou hast been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed in
a manner, quickly return to thyself and do not continue out of tune
longer than the compulsion lasts; for thou wilt have more mastery
over the harmony by continually recurring to it. 

If thou hadst a step-mother and a mother at the same time, thou wouldst
be dutiful to thy step-mother, but still thou wouldst constantly return
to thy mother. Let the court and philosophy now be to thee step-mother
and mother: return to philosophy frequently and repose in her, through
whom what thou meetest with in the court appears to thee tolerable,
and thou appearest tolerable in the court. 

When we have meat before us and such eatables we receive the impression,
that this is the dead body of a fish, and this is the dead body of
a bird or of a pig; and again, that this Falernian is only a little
grape juice, and this purple robe some sheep's wool dyed with the
blood of a shell-fish: such then are these impressions, and they reach
the things themselves and penetrate them, and so we see what kind
of things they are. Just in the same way ought we to act all through
life, and where there are things which appear most worthy of our approbation,
we ought to lay them bare and look at their worthlessness and strip
them of all the words by which they are exalted. For outward show
is a wonderful perverter of the reason, and when thou art most sure
that thou art employed about things worth thy pains, it is then that
it cheats thee most. Consider then what Crates says of Xenocrates
himself. 

Most of the things which the multitude admire are referred to objects
of the most general kind, those which are held together by cohesion
or natural organization, such as stones, wood, fig-trees, vines, olives.
But those which are admired by men who are a little more reasonable
are referred to the things which are held together by a living principle,
as flocks, herds. Those which are admired by men who are still more
instructed are the things which are held together by a rational soul,
not however a universal soul, but rational so far as it is a soul
skilled in some art, or expert in some other way, or simply rational
so far as it possesses a number of slaves. But he who values rational
soul, a soul universal and fitted for political life, regards nothing
else except this; and above all things he keeps his soul in a condition
and in an activity conformable to reason and social life, and he co-operates
to this end with those who are of the same kind as himself.

Some things are hurrying into existence, and others are hurrying out
of it; and of that which is coming into existence part is already
extinguished. Motions and changes are continually renewing the world,
just as the uninterrupted course of time is always renewing the infinite
duration of ages. In this flowing stream then, on which there is no
abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man
would set a high price? It would be just as if a man should fall in
love with one of the sparrows which fly by, but it has already passed
out of sight. Something of this kind is the very life of every man,
like the exhalation of the blood and the respiration of the air. For
such as it is to have once drawn in the air and to have given it back,
which we do every moment, just the same is it with the whole respiratory
power, which thou didst receive at thy birth yesterday and the day
before, to give it back to the element from which thou didst first
draw it. 

Neither is transpiration, as in plants, a thing to be valued, nor
respiration, as in domesticated animals and wild beasts, nor the receiving
of impressions by the appearances of things, nor being moved by desires
as puppets by strings, nor assembling in herds, nor being nourished
by food; for this is just like the act of separating and parting with
the useless part of our food. What then is worth being valued? To
be received with clapping of hands? No. Neither must we value the
clapping of tongues, for the praise which comes from the many is a
clapping of tongues. Suppose then that thou hast given up this worthless
thing called fame, what remains that is worth valuing? This in my
opinion, to move thyself and to restrain thyself in conformity to
thy proper constitution, to which end both all employments and arts
lead. For every art aims at this, that the thing which has been made
should be adapted to the work for which it has been made; and both
the vine-planter who looks after the vine, and the horse-breaker,
and he who trains the dog, seek this end. But the education and the
teaching of youth aim at something. In this then is the value of the
education and the teaching. And if this is well, thou wilt not seek
anything else. Wilt thou not cease to value many other things too?
Then thou wilt be neither free, nor sufficient for thy own happiness,
nor without passion. For of necessity thou must be envious, jealous,
and suspicious of those who can take away those things, and plot against
those who have that which is valued by thee. Of necessity a man must
be altogether in a state of perturbation who wants any of these things;
and besides, he must often find fault with the gods. But to reverence
and honour thy own mind will make thee content with thyself, and in
harmony with society, and in agreement with the gods, that is, praising
all that they give and have ordered. 

Above, below, all around are the movements of the elements. But the
motion of virtue is in none of these: it is something more divine,
and advancing by a way hardly observed it goes happily on its road.

How strangely men act. They will not praise those who are living at
the same time and living with themselves; but to be themselves praised
by posterity, by those whom they have never seen or ever will see,
this they set much value on. But this is very much the same as if
thou shouldst be grieved because those who have lived before thee
did not praise thee. 

If a thing is difficult to be accomplished by thyself, do not think
that it is impossible for man: but if anything is possible for man
and conformable to his nature, think that this can be attained by
thyself too. 

In the gymnastic exercises suppose that a man has torn thee with his
nails, and by dashing against thy head has inflicted a wound. Well,
we neither show any signs of vexation, nor are we offended, nor do
we suspect him afterwards as a treacherous fellow; and yet we are
on our guard against him, not however as an enemy, nor yet with suspicion,
but we quietly get out of his way. Something like this let thy behaviour
be in all the other parts of life; let us overlook many things in
those who are like antagonists in the gymnasium. For it is in our
power, as I said, to get out of the way, and to have no suspicion
nor hatred. 

If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think
or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which
no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error
and ignorance. 

I do my duty: other things trouble me not; for they are either things
without life, or things without reason, or things that have rambled
and know not the way. 

As to the animals which have no reason and generally all things and
objects, do thou, since thou hast reason and they have none, make
use of them with a generous and liberal spirit. But towards human
beings, as they have reason, behave in a social spirit. And on all
occasions call on the gods, and do not perplex thyself about the length
of time in which thou shalt do this; for even three hours so spent
are sufficient. 

Alexander the Macedonian and his groom by death were brought to the
same state; for either they were received among the same seminal principles
of the universe, or they were alike dispersed among the atoms.

Consider how many things in the same indivisible time take place in
each of us, things which concern the body and things which concern
the soul: and so thou wilt not wonder if many more things, or rather
all things which come into existence in that which is the one and
all, which we call Cosmos, exist in it at the same time.

If any man should propose to thee the question, how the name Antoninus
is written, wouldst thou with a straining of the voice utter each
letter? What then if they grow angry, wilt thou be angry too? Wilt
thou not go on with composure and number every letter? just so then
in this life also remember that every duty is made up of certain parts.
These it is thy duty to observe and without being disturbed or showing
anger towards those who are angry with thee to go on thy way and finish
that which is set before thee. 

How cruel it is not to allow men to strive after the things which
appear to them to be suitable to their nature and profitable! And
yet in a manner thou dost not allow them to do this, when thou art
vexed because they do wrong. For they are certainly moved towards
things because they suppose them to be suitable to their nature and
profitable to them.- But it is not so.- Teach them then, and show
them without being angry. 

Death is a cessation of the impressions through the senses, and of
the pulling of the strings which move the appetites, and of the discursive
movements of the thoughts, and of the service to the flesh.

It is a shame for the soul to be first to give way in this life, when
thy body does not give way. 

Take care that thou art not made into a Caesar, that thou art not
dyed with this dye; for such things happen. Keep thyself then simple,
good, pure, serious, free from affectation, a friend of justice, a
worshipper of the gods, kind, affectionate, strenuous in all proper
acts. Strive to continue to be such as philosophy wished to make thee.
Reverence the gods, and help men. Short is life. There is only one
fruit of this terrene life, a pious disposition and social acts. Do
everything as a disciple of Antoninus. Remember his constancy in every
act which was conformable to reason, and his evenness in all things,
and his piety, and the serenity of his countenance, and his sweetness,
and his disregard of empty fame, and his efforts to understand things;
and how he would never let anything pass without having first most
carefully examined it and clearly understood it; and how he bore with
those who blamed him unjustly without blaming them in return; how
he did nothing in a hurry; and how he listened not to calumnies, and
how exact an examiner of manners and actions he was; and not given
to reproach people, nor timid, nor suspicious, nor a sophist; and
with how little he was satisfied, such as lodging, bed, dress, food,
servants; and how laborious and patient; and how he was able on account
of his sparing diet to hold out to the evening, not even requiring
to relieve himself by any evacuations except at the usual hour; and
his firmness and uniformity in his friendships; and how he tolerated
freedom of speech in those who opposed his opinions; and the pleasure
that he had when any man showed him anything better; and how religious
he was without superstition. Imitate all this that thou mayest have
as good a conscience, when thy last hour comes, as he had.

Return to thy sober senses and call thyself back; and when thou hast
roused thyself from sleep and hast perceived that they were only dreams
which troubled thee, now in thy waking hours look at these (the things
about thee) as thou didst look at those (the dreams). 

I consist of a little body and a soul. Now to this little body all
things are indifferent, for it is not able to perceive differences.
But to the understanding those things only are indifferent, which
are not the works of its own activity. But whatever things are the
works of its own activity, all these are in its power. And of these
however only those which are done with reference to the present; for
as to the future and the past activities of the mind, even these are
for the present indifferent. 

Neither the labour which the hand does nor that of the foot is contrary
to nature, so long as the foot does the foot's work and the hand the
hand's. So then neither to a man as a man is his labour contrary to
nature, so long as it does the things of a man. But if the labour
is not contrary to his nature, neither is it an evil to him.

How many pleasures have been enjoyed by robbers, patricides, tyrants.

Dost thou not see how the handicraftsmen accommodate themselves up
to a certain point to those who are not skilled in their craft- nevertheless
they cling to the reason (the principles) of their art and do not
endure to depart from it? Is it not strange if the architect and the
physician shall have more respect to the reason (the principles) of
their own arts than man to his own reason, which is common to him
and the gods? 

Asia, Europe are corners of the universe: all the sea a drop in the
universe; Athos a little clod of the universe: all the present time
is a point in eternity. All things are little, changeable, perishable.
All things come from thence, from that universal ruling power either
directly proceeding or by way of sequence. And accordingly the lion's
gaping jaws, and that which is poisonous, and every harmful thing,
as a thorn, as mud, are after-products of the grand and beautiful.
Do not then imagine that they are of another kind from that which
thou dost venerate, but form a just opinion of the source of all.

He who has seen present things has seen all, both everything which
has taken place from all eternity and everything which will be for
time without end; for all things are of one kin and of one form.

Frequently consider the connexion of all things in the universe and
their relation to one another. For in a manner all things are implicated
with one another, and all in this way are friendly to one another;
for one thing comes in order after another, and this is by virtue
of the active movement and mutual conspiration and the unity of the
substance. 

Adapt thyself to the things with which thy lot has been cast: and
the men among whom thou hast received thy portion, love them, but
do it truly, sincerely. 

Every instrument, tool, vessel, if it does that for which it has been
made, is well, and yet he who made it is not there. But in the things
which are held together by nature there is within and there abides
in them the power which made them; wherefore the more is it fit to
reverence this power, and to think, that, if thou dost live and act
according to its will, everything in thee is in conformity to intelligence.
And thus also in the universe the things which belong to it are in
conformity to intelligence. 

Whatever of the things which are not within thy power thou shalt suppose
to be good for thee or evil, it must of necessity be that, if such
a bad thing befall thee or the loss of such a good thing, thou wilt
blame the gods, and hate men too, those who are the cause of the misfortune
or the loss, or those who are suspected of being likely to be the
cause; and indeed we do much injustice, because we make a difference
between these things. But if we judge only those things which are
in our power to be good or bad, there remains no reason either for
finding fault with God or standing in a hostile attitude to man.

We are all working together to one end, some with knowledge and design,
and others without knowing what they do; as men also when they are
asleep, of whom it is Heraclitus, I think, who says that they are
labourers and co-operators in the things which take place in the universe.
But men co-operate after different fashions: and even those co-operate
abundantly, who find fault with what happens and those who try to
oppose it and to hinder it; for the universe had need even of such
men as these. It remains then for thee to understand among what kind
of workmen thou placest thyself; for he who rules all things will
certainly make a right use of thee, and he will receive thee among
some part of the co-operators and of those whose labours conduce to
one end. But be not thou such a part as the mean and ridiculous verse
in the play, which Chrysippus speaks of. 

Does the sun undertake to do the work of the rain, or Aesculapius
the work of the Fruit-bearer (the earth)? And how is it with respect
to each of the stars, are they not different and yet they work together
to the same end? 

If the gods have determined about me and about the things which must
happen to me, they have determined well, for it is not easy even to
imagine a deity without forethought; and as to doing me harm, why
should they have any desire towards that? For what advantage would
result to them from this or to the whole, which is the special object
of their providence? But if they have not determined about me individually,
they have certainly determined about the whole at least, and the things
which happen by way of sequence in this general arrangement I ought
to accept with pleasure and to be content with them. But if they determine
about nothing- which it is wicked to believe, or if we do believe
it, let us neither sacrifice nor pray nor swear by them nor do anything
else which we do as if the gods were present and lived with us- but
if however the gods determine about none of the things which concern
us, I am able to determine about myself, and I can inquire about that
which is useful; and that is useful to every man which is conformable
to his own constitution and nature. But my nature is rational and
social; and my city and country, so far as I am Antoninus, is Rome,
but so far as I am a man, it is the world. The things then which are
useful to these cities are alone useful to me. Whatever happens to
every man, this is for the interest of the universal: this might be
sufficient. But further thou wilt observe this also as a general truth,
if thou dost observe, that whatever is profitable to any man is profitable
also to other men. But let the word profitable be taken here in the
common sense as said of things of the middle kind, neither good nor
bad. 

As it happens to thee in the amphitheatre and such places, that the
continual sight of the same things and the uniformity make the spectacle
wearisome, so it is in the whole of life; for all things above, below,
are the same and from the same. How long then? 

Think continually that all kinds of men and of all kinds of pursuits
and of all nations are dead, so that thy thoughts come down even to
Philistion and Phoebus and Origanion. Now turn thy thoughts to the
other kinds of men. To that place then we must remove, where there
are so many great orators, and so many noble philosophers, Heraclitus,
Pythagoras, Socrates; so many heroes of former days, and so many generals
after them, and tyrants; besides these, Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes,
and other men of acute natural talents, great minds, lovers of labour,
versatile, confident, mockers even of the perishable and ephemeral
life of man, as Menippus and such as are like him. As to all these
consider that they have long been in the dust. What harm then is this
to them; and what to those whose names are altogether unknown? One
thing here is worth a great deal, to pass thy life in truth and justice,
with a benevolent disposition even to liars and unjust men.

When thou wishest to delight thyself, think of the virtues of those
who live with thee; for instance, the activity of one, and the modesty
of another, and the liberality of a third, and some other good quality
of a fourth. For nothing delights so much as the examples of the virtues,
when they are exhibited in the morals of those who live with us and
present themselves in abundance, as far as is possible. Wherefore
we must keep them before us. 

Thou art not dissatisfied, I suppose, because thou weighest only so
many litrae and not three hundred. Be not dissatisfied then that thou
must live only so many years and not more; for as thou art satisfied
with the amount of substance which has been assigned to thee, so be
content with the time. 

Let us try to persuade them (men). But act even against their will,
when the principles of justice lead that way. If however any man by
using force stands in thy way, betake thyself to contentment and tranquility,
and at the same time employ the hindrance towards the exercise of
some other virtue; and remember that thy attempt was with a reservation,
that thou didst not desire to do impossibilities. What then didst
thou desire?- Some such effort as this.- But thou attainest thy object,
if the things to which thou wast moved are accomplished.

He who loves fame considers another man's activity to be his own good;
and he who loves pleasure, his own sensations; but he who has understanding,
considers his own acts to be his own good. 

It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing, and not to be
disturbed in our soul; for things themselves have no natural power
to form our judgements. 

Accustom thyself to attend carefully to what is said by another, and
as much as it is possible, be in the speaker's mind. 

That which is not good for the swarm, neither is it good for the bee.

If sailors abused the helmsman or the sick the doctor, would they
listen to anybody else; or how could the helmsman secure the safety
of those in the ship or the doctor the health of those whom he attends?

How many together with whom I came into the world are already gone
out of it. 

To the jaundiced honey tastes bitter, and to those bitten by mad dogs
water causes fear; and to little children the ball is a fine thing.
Why then am I angry? Dost thou think that a false opinion has less
power than the bile in the jaundiced or the poison in him who is bitten
by a mad dog? 

No man will hinder thee from living according to the reason of thy
own nature: nothing will happen to thee contrary to the reason of
the universal nature. 

What kind of people are those whom men wish to please, and for what
objects, and by what kind of acts? How soon will time cover all things,
and how many it has covered already.

BOOK SEVEN

What is badness? It is that which thou hast often seen. And on the
occasion of everything which happens keep this in mind, that it is
that which thou hast often seen. Everywhere up and down thou wilt
find the same things, with which the old histories are filled, those
of the middle ages and those of our own day; with which cities and
houses are filled now. There is nothing new: all things are both familiar
and short-lived. 

How can our principles become dead, unless the impressions (thoughts)
which correspond to them are extinguished? But it is in thy power
continuously to fan these thoughts into a flame. I can have that opinion
about anything, which I ought to have. If I can, why am I disturbed?
The things which are external to my mind have no relation at all to
my mind.- Let this be the state of thy affects, and thou standest
erect. To recover thy life is in thy power. Look at things again as
thou didst use to look at them; for in this consists the recovery
of thy life. 

The idle business of show, plays on the stage, flocks of sheep, herds,
exercises with spears, a bone cast to little dogs, a bit of bread
into fish-ponds, labourings of ants and burden-carrying, runnings
about of frightened little mice, puppets pulled by strings- all alike.
It is thy duty then in the midst of such things to show good humour
and not a proud air; to understand however that every man is worth
just so much as the things are worth about which he busies himself.

In discourse thou must attend to what is said, and in every movement
thou must observe what is doing. And in the one thou shouldst see
immediately to what end it refers, but in the other watch carefully
what is the thing signified. 

Is my understanding sufficient for this or not? If it is sufficient,
I use it for the work as an instrument given by the universal nature.
But if it is not sufficient, then either I retire from the work and
give way to him who is able to do it better, unless there be some
reason why I ought not to do so; or I do it as well as I can, taking
to help me the man who with the aid of my ruling principle can do
what is now fit and useful for the general good. For whatsoever either
by myself or with another I can do, ought to be directed to this only,
to that which is useful and well suited to society. 

How many after being celebrated by fame have been given up to oblivion;
and how many who have celebrated the fame of others have long been
dead. 

Be not ashamed to be helped; for it is thy business to do thy duty
like a soldier in the assault on a town. How then, if being lame thou
canst not mount up on the battlements alone, but with the help of
another it is possible? 

Let not future things disturb thee, for thou wilt come to them, if
it shall be necessary, having with thee the same reason which now
thou usest for present things. 

All things are implicated with one another, and the bond is holy;
and there is hardly anything unconnected with any other thing. For
things have been co-ordinated, and they combine to form the same universe
(order). For there is one universe made up of all things, and one
God who pervades all things, and one substance, and one law, one common
reason in all intelligent animals, and one truth; if indeed there
is also one perfection for all animals which are of the same stock
and participate in the same reason. 

Everything material soon disappears in the substance of the whole;
and everything formal (causal) is very soon taken back into the universal
reason; and the memory of everything is very soon overwhelmed in time.

To the rational animal the same act is according to nature and according
to reason. 

Be thou erect, or be made erect. 
Just as it is with the members in those bodies which are united in
one, so it is with rational beings which exist separate, for they
have been constituted for one co-operation. And the perception of
this will be more apparent to thee, if thou often sayest to thyself
that I am a member (melos) of the system of rational beings. But if
(using the letter r) thou sayest that thou art a part (meros) thou
dost not yet love men from thy heart; beneficence does not yet delight
thee for its own sake; thou still doest it barely as a thing of propriety,
and not yet as doing good to thyself. 

Let there fall externally what will on the parts which can feel the
effects of this fall. For those parts which have felt will complain,
if they choose. But I, unless I think that what has happened is an
evil, am not injured. And it is in my power not to think so.

Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the gold,
or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this, Whatever any
one does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour. 

The ruling faculty does not disturb itself; I mean, does not frighten
itself or cause itself pain. But if any one else can frighten or pain
it, let him do so. For the faculty itself will not by its own opinion
turn itself into such ways. Let the body itself take care, if it can,
that is suffer nothing, and let it speak, if it suffers. But the soul
itself, that which is subject to fear, to pain, which has completely
the power of forming an opinion about these things, will suffer nothing,
for it will never deviate into such a judgement. The leading principle
in itself wants nothing, unless it makes a want for itself; and therefore
it is both free from perturbation and unimpeded, if it does not disturb
and impede itself. 

Eudaemonia (happiness) is a good daemon, or a good thing. What then
art thou doing here, O imagination? Go away, I entreat thee by the
gods, as thou didst come, for I want thee not. But thou art come according
to thy old fashion. I am not angry with thee: only go away.

Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change?
What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature?
And canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change? And
canst thou be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change? And can
anything else that is useful be accomplished without change? Dost
thou not see then that for thyself also to change is just the same,
and equally necessary for the universal nature? 

Through the universal substance as through a furious torrent all bodies
are carried, being by their nature united with and cooperating with
the whole, as the parts of our body with one another. How many a Chrysippus,
how many a Socrates, how many an Epictetus has time already swallowed
up? And let the same thought occur to thee with reference to every
man and thing. 

One thing only troubles me, lest I should do something which the constitution
of man does not allow, or in the way which it does not allow, or what
it does not allow now. 

Near is thy forgetfulness of all things; and near the forgetfulness
of thee by all. 

It is peculiar to man to love even those who do wrong. And this happens,
if when they do wrong it occurs to thee that they are kinsmen, and
that they do wrong through ignorance and unintentionally, and that
soon both of you will die; and above all, that the wrong-doer has
done thee no harm, for he has not made thy ruling faculty worse than
it was before. 

The universal nature out of the universal substance, as if it were
wax, now moulds a horse, and when it has broken this up, it uses the
material for a tree, then for a man, then for something else; and
each of these things subsists for a very short time. But it is no
hardship for the vessel to be broken up, just as there was none in
its being fastened together. 

A scowling look is altogether unnatural; when it is often assumed,
the result is that all comeliness dies away, and at last is so completely
extinguished that it cannot be again lighted up at all. Try to conclude
from this very fact that it is contrary to reason. For if even the
perception of doing wrong shall depart, what reason is there for living
any longer? 

Nature which governs the whole will soon change all things which thou
seest, and out of their substance will make other things, and again
other things from the substance of them, in order that the world may
be ever new. 

When a man has done thee any wrong, immediately consider with what
opinion about good or evil he has done wrong. For when thou hast seen
this, thou wilt pity him, and wilt neither wonder nor be angry. For
either thou thyself thinkest the same thing to be good that he does
or another thing of the same kind. It is thy duty then to pardon him.
But if thou dost not think such things to be good or evil, thou wilt
more readily be well disposed to him who is in error. 

Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but
of the things which thou hast select the best, and then reflect how
eagerly they would have been sought, if thou hadst them not. At the
same time however take care that thou dost not through being so pleased
with them accustom thyself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed
if ever thou shouldst not have them. 

Retire into thyself. The rational principle which rules has this nature,
that it is content with itself when it does what is just, and so secures
tranquility. 

Wipe out the imagination. Stop the pulling of the strings. Confine
thyself to the present. Understand well what happens either to thee
or to another. Divide and distribute every object into the causal
(formal) and the material. Think of thy last hour. Let the wrong which
is done by a man stay there where the wrong was done. 

Direct thy attention to what is said. Let thy understanding enter
into the things that are doing and the things which do them.

Adorn thyself with simplicity and modesty and with indifference towards
the things which lie between virtue and vice. Love mankind. Follow
God. The poet says that Law rules all.- And it is enough to remember
that Law rules all. 

About death: Whether it is a dispersion, or a resolution into atoms,
or annihilation, it is either extinction or change. 

About pain: The pain which is intolerable carries us off; but that
which lasts a long time is tolerable; and the mind maintains its own
tranquility by retiring into itself, and the ruling faculty is not
made worse. But the parts which are harmed by pain, let them, if they
can, give their opinion about it. 

About fame: Look at the minds of those who seek fame, observe what
they are, and what kind of things they avoid, and what kind of things
they pursue. And consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another
hide the former sands, so in life the events which go before are soon
covered by those which come after. 

From Plato: The man who has an elevated mind and takes a view of all
time and of all substance, dost thou suppose it possible for him to
think that human life is anything great? it is not possible, he said.-
Such a man then will think that death also is no evil.- Certainly
not. 

From Antisthenes: It is royal to do good and to be abused.

It is a base thing for the countenance to be obedient and to regulate
and compose itself as the mind commands, and for the mind not to be
regulated and composed by itself. 

It is not right to vex ourselves at things, 
For they care nought about it. 

To the immortal gods and us give joy. 

Life must be reaped like the ripe ears of corn: 
One man is born; another dies. 

If gods care not for me and for my children, 
There is a reason for it. 

For the good is with me, and the just. 

No joining others in their wailing, no violent emotion. 

From Plato: But I would make this man a sufficient answer, which is
this: Thou sayest not well, if thou thinkest that a man who is good
for anything at all ought to compute the hazard of life or death,
and should not rather look to this only in all that he does, whether
he is doing what is just or unjust, and the works of a good or a bad
man. 

For thus it is, men of Athens, in truth: wherever a man has placed
himself thinking it the best place for him, or has been placed by
a commander, there in my opinion he ought to stay and to abide the
hazard, taking nothing into the reckoning, either death or anything
else, before the baseness of deserting his post. 

But, my good friend, reflect whether that which is noble and good
is not something different from saving and being saved; for as to
a man living such or such a time, at least one who is really a man,
consider if this is not a thing to be dismissed from the thoughts:
and there must be no love of life: but as to these matters a man must
intrust them to the deity and believe what the women say, that no
man can escape his destiny, the next inquiry being how he may best
live the time that he has to live. 

Look round at the courses of the stars, as if thou wert going along
with them; and constantly consider the changes of the elements into
one another; for such thoughts purge away the filth of the terrene
life. 

This is a fine saying of Plato: That he who is discoursing about men
should look also at earthly things as if he viewed them from some
higher place; should look at them in their assemblies, armies, agricultural
labours, marriages, treaties, births, deaths, noise of the courts
of justice, desert places, various nations of barbarians, feasts,
lamentations, markets, a mixture of all things and an orderly combination
of contraries. 

Consider the past; such great changes of political supremacies. Thou
mayest foresee also the things which will be. For they will certainly
be of like form, and it is not possible that they should deviate from
the order of the things which take place now: accordingly to have
contemplated human life for forty years is the same as to have contemplated
it for ten thousand years. For what more wilt thou see? 

That which has grown from the earth to the earth, 
But that which has sprung from heavenly seed, 
Back to the heavenly realms returns. This is either a dissolution
of the mutual involution of the atoms, or a similar dispersion of
the unsentient elements. 

With food and drinks and cunning magic arts 
Turning the channel's course to 'scape from death. 
The breeze which heaven has sent 
We must endure, and toil without complaining. 

Another may be more expert in casting his opponent; but he is not
more social, nor more modest, nor better disciplined to meet all that
happens, nor more considerate with respect to the faults of his neighbours.

Where any work can be done conformably to the reason which is common
to gods and men, there we have nothing to fear: for where we are able
to get profit by means of the activity which is successful and proceeds
according to our constitution, there no harm is to be suspected.

Everywhere and at all times it is in thy power piously to acquiesce
in thy present condition, and to behave justly to those who are about
thee, and to exert thy skill upon thy present thoughts, that nothing
shall steal into them without being well examined. 

Do not look around thee to discover other men's ruling principles,
but look straight to this, to what nature leads thee, both the universal
nature through the things which happen to thee, and thy own nature
through the acts which must be done by thee. But every being ought
to do that which is according to its constitution; and all other things
have been constituted for the sake of rational beings, just as among
irrational things the inferior for the sake of the superior, but the
rational for the sake of one another. 

The prime principle then in man's constitution is the social. And
the second is not to yield to the persuasions of the body, for it
is the peculiar office of the rational and intelligent motion to circumscribe
itself, and never to be overpowered either by the motion of the senses
or of the appetites, for both are animal; but the intelligent motion
claims superiority and does not permit itself to be overpowered by
the others. And with good reason, for it is formed by nature to use
all of them. The third thing in the rational constitution is freedom
from error and from deception. Let then the ruling principle holding
fast to these things go straight on, and it has what is its own.

Consider thyself to be dead, and to have completed thy life up to
the present time; and live according to nature the remainder which
is allowed thee. 

Love that only which happens to thee and is spun with the thread of
thy destiny. For what is more suitable? 

In everything which happens keep before thy eyes those to whom the
same things happened, and how they were vexed, and treated them as
strange things, and found fault with them: and now where are they?
Nowhere. Why then dost thou too choose to act in the same way? And
why dost thou not leave these agitations which are foreign to nature,
to those who cause them and those who are moved by them? And why art
thou not altogether intent upon the right way of making use of the
things which happen to thee? For then thou wilt use them well, and
they will be a material for thee to work on. Only attend to thyself,
and resolve to be a good man in every act which thou doest: and remember...

Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble
up, if thou wilt ever dig. 

The body ought to be compact, and to show no irregularity either in
motion or attitude. For what the mind shows in the face by maintaining
in it the expression of intelligence and propriety, that ought to
be required also in the whole body. But all of these things should
be observed without affectation. 

The art of life is more like the wrestler's art than the dancer's,
in respect of this, that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsets
which are sudden and unexpected. 

Constantly observe who those are whose approbation thou wishest to
have, and what ruling principles they possess. For then thou wilt
neither blame those who offend involuntarily, nor wilt thou want their
approbation, if thou lookest to the sources of their opinions and
appetites. 

Every soul, the philosopher says, is involuntarily deprived of truth;
consequently in the same way it is deprived of justice and temperance
and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is most necessary to
bear this constantly in mind, for thus thou wilt be more gentle towards
all. 

In every pain let this thought be present, that there is no dishonour
in it, nor does it make the governing intelligence worse, for it does
not damage the intelligence either so far as the intelligence is rational
or so far as it is social. Indeed in the case of most pains let this
remark of Epicurus aid thee, that pain is neither intolerable nor
everlasting, if thou bearest in mind that it has its limits, and if
thou addest nothing to it in imagination: and remember this too, that
we do not perceive that many things which are disagreeable to us are
the same as pain, such as excessive drowsiness, and the being scorched
by heat, and the having no appetite. When then thou art discontented
about any of these things, say to thyself, that thou art yielding
to pain. 

Take care not to feel towards the inhuman, as they feel towards men.

How do we know if Telauges was not superior in character to Socrates?
For it is not enough that Socrates died a more noble death, and disputed
more skilfully with the sophists, and passed the night in the cold
with more endurance, and that when he was bid to arrest Leon of Salamis,
he considered it more noble to refuse, and that he walked in a swaggering
way in the streets- though as to this fact one may have great doubts
if it was true. But we ought to inquire, what kind of a soul it was
that Socrates possessed, and if he was able to be content with being
just towards men and pious towards the gods, neither idly vexed on
account of men's villainy, nor yet making himself a slave to any man's
ignorance, nor receiving as strange anything that fell to his share
out of the universal, nor enduring it as intolerable, nor allowing
his understanding to sympathize with the affects of the miserable
flesh. 

Nature has not so mingled the intelligence with the composition of
the body, as not to have allowed thee the power of circumscribing
thyself and of bringing under subjection to thyself all that is thy
own; for it is very possible to be a divine man and to be recognised
as such by no one. Always bear this in mind; and another thing too,
that very little indeed is necessary for living a happy life. And
because thou hast despaired of becoming a dialectician and skilled
in the knowledge of nature, do not for this reason renounce the hope
of being both free and modest and social and obedient to God.

It is in thy power to live free from all compulsion in the greatest
tranquility of mind, even if all the world cry out against thee as
much as they choose, and even if wild beasts tear in pieces the members
of this kneaded matter which has grown around thee. For what hinders
the mind in the midst of all this from maintaining itself in tranquility
and in a just judgement of all surrounding things and in a ready use
of the objects which are presented to it, so that the judgement may
say to the thing which falls under its observation: This thou art
in substance (reality), though in men's opinion thou mayest appear
to be of a different kind; and the use shall say to that which falls
under the hand: Thou art the thing that I was seeking; for to me that
which presents itself is always a material for virtue both rational
and political, and in a word, for the exercise of art, which belongs
to man or God. For everything which happens has a relationship either
to God or man, and is neither new nor difficult to handle, but usual
and apt matter to work on. 

The perfection of moral character consists in this, in passing every
day as the last, and in being neither violently excited nor torpid
nor playing the hypocrite. 

The gods who are immortal are not vexed because during so long a time
they must tolerate continually men such as they are and so many of
them bad; and besides this, they also take care of them in all ways.
But thou, who art destined to end so soon, art thou wearied of enduring
the bad, and this too when thou art one of them? 

It is a ridiculous thing for a man not to fly from his own badness,
which is indeed possible, but to fly from other men's badness, which
is impossible. 

Whatever the rational and political (social) faculty finds to be neither
intelligent nor social, it properly judges to be inferior to itself.

When thou hast done a good act and another has received it, why dost
thou look for a third thing besides these, as fools do, either to
have the reputation of having done a good act or to obtain a return?

No man is tired of receiving what is useful. But it is useful to act
according to nature. Do not then be tired of receiving what is useful
by doing it to others. 

The nature of the An moved to make the universe. But now either everything
that takes place comes by way of consequence or continuity; or even
the chief things towards which the ruling power of the universe directs
its own movement are governed by no rational principle. If this is
remembered it will make thee more tranquil in many things.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK EIGHT

This reflection also tends to the removal of the desire of empty
fame, that it is no longer in thy power to have lived the whole of
thy life, or at least thy life from thy youth upwards, like a philosopher;
but both to many others and to thyself it is plain that thou art far
from philosophy. Thou hast fallen into disorder then, so that it is
no longer easy for thee to get the reputation of a philosopher; and
thy plan of life also opposes it. If then thou hast truly seen where
the matter lies, throw away the thought, How thou shalt seem to others,
and be content if thou shalt live the rest of thy life in such wise
as thy nature wills. Observe then what it wills, and let nothing else
distract thee; for thou hast had experience of many wanderings without
having found happiness anywhere, not in syllogisms, nor in wealth,
nor in reputation, nor in enjoyment, nor anywhere. Where is it then?
In doing what man's nature requires. How then shall a man do this?
If he has principles from which come his affects and his acts. What
principles? Those which relate to good and bad: the belief that there
is nothing good for man, which does not make him just, temperate,
manly, free; and that there is nothing bad, which does not do the
contrary to what has been mentioned. 

On the occasion of every act ask thyself, How is this with respect
to me? Shall I repent of it? A little time and I am dead, and all
is gone. What more do I seek, if what I am now doing is work of an
intelligent living being, and a social being, and one who is under
the same law with God? 

Alexander and Gaius and Pompeius, what are they in comparison with
Diogenes and Heraclitus and Socrates? For they were acquainted with
things, and their causes (forms), and their matter, and the ruling
principles of these men were the same. But as to the others, how many
things had they to care for, and to how many things were they slaves?

Consider that men will do the same things nevertheless, even though
thou shouldst burst. 

This is the chief thing: Be not perturbed, for all things are according
to the nature of the universal; and in a little time thou wilt be
nobody and nowhere, like Hadrian and Augustus. In the next place having
fixed thy eyes steadily on thy business look at it, and at the same
time remembering that it is thy duty to be a good man, and what man's
nature demands, do that without turning aside; and speak as it seems
to thee most just, only let it be with a good disposition and with
modesty and without hypocrisy. 

The nature of the universal has this work to do, to remove to that
place the things which are in this, to change them, to take them away
hence, and to carry them there. All things are change, yet we need
not fear anything new. All things are familiar to us; but the distribution
of them still remains the same. 

Every nature is contented with itself when it goes on its way well;
and a rational nature goes on its way well, when in its thoughts it
assents to nothing false or uncertain, and when it directs its movements
to social acts only, and when it confines its desires and aversions
to the things which are in its power, and when it is satisfied with
everything that is assigned to it by the common nature. For of this
common nature every particular nature is a part, as the nature of
the leaf is a part of the nature of the plant; except that in the
plant the nature of the leaf is part of a nature which has not perception
or reason, and is subject to be impeded; but the nature of man is
part of a nature which is not subject to impediments, and is intelligent
and just, since it gives to everything in equal portions and according
to its worth, times, substance, cause (form), activity, and incident.
But examine, not to discover that any one thing compared with any
other single thing is equal in all respects, but by taking all the
parts together of one thing and comparing them with all the parts
together of another. 

Thou hast not leisure or ability to read. But thou hast leisure or
ability to check arrogance: thou hast leisure to be superior to pleasure
and pain: thou hast leisure to be superior to love of fame, and not
to be vexed at stupid and ungrateful people, nay even to care for
them. 

Let no man any longer hear thee finding fault with the court life
or with thy own. 

Repentance is a kind of self-reproof for having neglected something
useful; but that which is good must be something useful, and the perfect
good man should look after it. But no such man would ever repent of
having refused any sensual pleasure. Pleasure then is neither good
nor useful. 

This thing, what is it in itself, in its own constitution? What is
its substance and material? And what its causal nature (or form)?
And what is it doing in the world? And how long does it subsist?

When thou risest from sleep with reluctance, remember that it is according
to thy constitution and according to human nature to perform social
acts, but sleeping is common also to irrational animals. But that
which is according to each individual's nature is also more peculiarly
its own, and more suitable to its nature, and indeed also more agreeable.

Constantly and, if it be possible, on the occasion of every impression
on the soul, apply to it the principles of Physic, of Ethic, and of
Dialectic. 

Whatever man thou meetest with, immediately say to thyself: What opinions
has this man about good and bad? For if with respect to pleasure and
pain and the causes of each, and with respect to fame and ignominy,
death and life, he has such and such opinions, it will seem nothing
wonderful or strange to me, if he does such and such things; and I
shall bear in mind that he is compelled to do so. 

Remember that as it is a shame to be surprised if the fig-tree produces
figs, so it is to be surprised if the world produces such and such
things of which it is productive; and for the physician and the helmsman
it is a shame to be surprised, if a man has a fever, or if the wind
is unfavourable. 

Remember that to change thy opinion and to follow him who corrects
thy error is as consistent with freedom as it is to persist in thy
error. For it is thy own, the activity which is exerted according
to thy own movement and judgement, and indeed according to thy own
understanding too. 

If a thing is in thy own power, why dost thou do it? But if it is
in the power of another, whom dost thou blame? The atoms (chance)
or the gods? Both are foolish. Thou must blame nobody. For if thou
canst, correct that which is the cause; but if thou canst not do this,
correct at least the thing itself; but if thou canst not do even this,
of what use is it to thee to find fault? For nothing should be done
without a purpose. 

That which has died falls not out of the universe. If it stays here,
it also changes here, and is dissolved into its proper parts, which
are elements of the universe and of thyself. And these too change,
and they murmur not. 

Everything exists for some end, a horse, a vine. Why dost thou wonder?
Even the sun will say, I am for some purpose, and the rest of the
gods will say the same. For what purpose then art thou? to enjoy pleasure?
See if common sense allows this. 

Nature has had regard in everything no less to the end than to the
beginning and the continuance, just like the man who throws up a ball.
What good is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it
to come down, or even to have fallen? And what good is it to the bubble
while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst? The same may
be said of a light also. 

Turn it (the body) inside out, and see what kind of thing it is; and
when it has grown old, what kind of thing it becomes, and when it
is diseased. 

Short-lived are both the praiser and the praised, and the rememberer
and the remembered: and all this in a nook of this part of the world;
and not even here do all agree, no, not any one with himself: and
the whole earth too is a point. 

Attend to the matter which is before thee, whether it is an opinion
or an act or a word. 

Thou sufferest this justly: for thou choosest rather to become good
to-morrow than to be good to-day. 

Am I doing anything? I do it with reference to the good of mankind.
Does anything happen to me? I receive it and refer it to the gods,
and the source of all things, from which all that happens is derived.

Such as bathing appears to thee- oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all
things disgusting- so is every part of life and everything.

Lucilla saw Verus die, and then Lucilla died. Secunda saw Maximus
die, and then Secunda died. Epitynchanus saw Diotimus die, and Epitynchanus
died. Antoninus saw Faustina die, and then Antoninus died. Such is
everything. Celer saw Hadrian die, and then Celer died. And those
sharp-witted men, either seers or men inflated with pride, where are
they? For instance the sharp-witted men, Charax and Demetrius the
Platonist and Eudaemon, and any one else like them. All ephemeral,
dead long ago. Some indeed have not been remembered even for a short
time, and others have become the heroes of fables, and again others
have disappeared even from fables. Remember this then, that this little
compound, thyself, must either be dissolved, or thy poor breath must
be extinguished, or be removed and placed elsewhere. 

It is satisfaction to a man to do the proper works of a man. Now it
is a proper work of a man to be benevolent to his own kind, to despise
the movements of the senses, to form a just judgement of plausible
appearances, and to take a survey of the nature of the universe and
of the things which happen in it. 

There are three relations between thee and other things: the one to
the body which surrounds thee; the second to the divine cause from
which all things come to all; and the third to those who live with
thee. 

Pain is either an evil to the body- then let the body say what it
thinks of it- or to the soul; but it is in the power of the soul to
maintain its own serenity and tranquility, and not to think that pain
is an evil. For every judgement and movement and desire and aversion
is within, and no evil ascends so high. 

Wipe out thy imaginations by often saying to thyself: now it is in
my power to let no badness be in this soul, nor desire nor any perturbation
at all; but looking at all things I see what is their nature, and
I use each according to its value.- Remember this power which thou
hast from nature. 

Speak both in the senate and to every man, whoever he may be, appropriately,
not with any affectation: use plain discourse. 

Augustus' court, wife, daughter, descendants, ancestors, sister, Agrippa,
kinsmen, intimates, friends, Areius, Maecenas, physicians and sacrificing
priests- the whole court is dead. Then turn to the rest, not considering
the death of a single man, but of a whole race, as of the Pompeii;
and that which is inscribed on the tombs- The last of his race. Then
consider what trouble those before them have had that they might leave
a successor; and then, that of necessity some one must be the last.
Again here consider the death of a whole race. 

It is thy duty to order thy life well in every single act; and if
every act does its duty, as far as is possible, be content; and no
one is able to hinder thee so that each act shall not do its duty.-
But something external will stand in the way.- Nothing will stand
in the way of thy acting justly and soberly and considerately.- But
perhaps some other active power will be hindered.- Well, but by acquiescing
in the hindrance and by being content to transfer thy efforts to that
which is allowed, another opportunity of action is immediately put
before thee in place of that which was hindered, and one which will
adapt itself to this ordering of which we are speaking. 

Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and be ready to let
it go. 

If thou didst ever see a hand cut off, or a foot, or a head, lying
anywhere apart from the rest of the body, such does a man make himself,
as far as he can, who is not content with what happens, and separates
himself from others, or does anything unsocial. Suppose that thou
hast detached thyself from the natural unity- for thou wast made by
nature a part, but now thou hast cut thyself off- yet here there is
this beautiful provision, that it is in thy power again to unite thyself.
God has allowed this to no other part, after it has been separated
and cut asunder, to come together again. But consider the kindness
by which he has distinguished man, for he has put it in his power
not to be separated at all from the universal; and when he has been
separated, he has allowed him to return and to be united and to resume
his place as a part. 

As the nature of the universal has given to every rational being all
the other powers that it has, so we have received from it this power
also. For as the universal nature converts and fixes in its predestined
place everything which stands in the way and opposes it, and makes
such things a part of itself, so also the rational animal is able
to make every hindrance its own material, and to use it for such purposes
as it may have designed. 

Do not disturb thyself by thinking of the whole of thy life. Let not
thy thoughts at once embrace all the various troubles which thou mayest
expect to befall thee: but on every occasion ask thyself, What is
there in this which is intolerable and past bearing? For thou wilt
be ashamed to confess. In the next place remember that neither the
future nor the past pains thee, but only the present. But this is
reduced to a very little, if thou only circumscribest it, and chidest
thy mind, if it is unable to hold out against even this.

Does Panthea or Pergamus now sit by the tomb of Verus? Does Chaurias
or Diotimus sit by the tomb of Hadrian? That would be ridiculous.
Well, suppose they did sit there, would the dead be conscious of it?
And if the dead were conscious, would they be pleased? And if they
were pleased, would that make them immortal? Was it not in the order
of destiny that these persons too should first become old women and
old men and then die? What then would those do after these were dead?
All this is foul smell and blood in a bag. 

If thou canst see sharp, look and judge wisely, says the philosopher.

In the constitution of the rational animal I see no virtue which is
opposed to justice; but I see a virtue which is opposed to love of
pleasure, and that is temperance. 

If thou takest away thy opinion about that which appears to give thee
pain, thou thyself standest in perfect security.- Who is this self?-
The reason.- But I am not reason.- Be it so. Let then the reason itself
not trouble itself. But if any other part of thee suffers, let it
have its own opinion about itself. 

Hindrance to the perceptions of sense is an evil to the animal nature.
Hindrance to the movements (desires) is equally an evil to the animal
nature. And something else also is equally an impediment and an evil
to the constitution of plants. So then that which is a hindrance to
the intelligence is an evil to the intelligent nature. Apply all these
things then to thyself. Does pain or sensuous pleasure affect thee?
The senses will look to that.- Has any obstacle opposed thee in thy
efforts towards an object? if indeed thou wast making this effort
absolutely (unconditionally, or without any reservation), certainly
this obstacle is an evil to thee considered as a rational animal.
But if thou takest into consideration the usual course of things,
thou hast not yet been injured nor even impeded. The things however
which are proper to the understanding no other man is used to impede,
for neither fire, nor iron, nor tyrant, nor abuse, touches it in any
way. When it has been made a sphere, it continues a sphere.

It is not fit that I should give myself pain, for I have never intentionally
given pain even to another. 

Different things delight different people. But it is my delight to
keep the ruling faculty sound without turning away either from any
man or from any of the things which happen to men, but looking at
and receiving all with welcome eyes and using everything according
to its value. 

See that thou secure this present time to thyself: for those who rather
pursue posthumous fame do consider that the men of after time will
be exactly such as these whom they cannot bear now; and both are mortal.
And what is it in any way to thee if these men of after time utter
this or that sound, or have this or that opinion about thee?

Take me and cast me where thou wilt; for there I shall keep my divine
part tranquil, that is, content, if it can feel and act conformably
to its proper constitution. Is this change of place sufficient reason
why my soul should be unhappy and worse than it was, depressed, expanded,
shrinking, affrighted? And what wilt thou find which is sufficient
reason for this? 

Nothing can happen to any man which is not a human accident, nor to
an ox which is not according to the nature of an ox, nor to a vine
which is not according to the nature of a vine, nor to a stone which
is not proper to a stone. If then there happens to each thing both
what is usual and natural, why shouldst thou complain? For the common
nature brings nothing which may not be borne by thee. 

If thou art pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that
disturbs thee, but thy own judgement about it. And it is in thy power
to wipe out this judgement now. But if anything in thy own disposition
gives thee pain, who hinders thee from correcting thy opinion? And
even if thou art pained because thou art not doing some particular
thing which seems to thee to be right, why dost thou not rather act
than complain?- But some insuperable obstacle is in the way?- Do not
be grieved then, for the cause of its not being done depends not on
thee.- But it is not worth while to live if this cannot be done.-
Take thy departure then from life contentedly, just as he dies who
is in full activity, and well pleased too with the things which are
obstacles. 

Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible, when self-collected
it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing which it does not
choose to do, even if it resist from mere obstinacy. What then will
it be when it forms a judgement about anything aided by reason and
deliberately? Therefore the mind which is free from passions is a
citadel, for man has nothing more secure to which he can fly for,
refuge and for the future be inexpugnable. He then who has not seen
this is an ignorant man; but he who has seen it and does not fly to
this refuge is unhappy. 

Say nothing more to thyself than what the first appearances report.
Suppose that it has been reported to thee that a certain person speaks
ill of thee. This has been reported; but that thou hast been injured,
that has not been reported. I see that my child is sick. I do see;
but that he is in danger, I do not see. Thus then always abide by
the first appearances, and add nothing thyself from within, and then
nothing happens to thee. Or rather add something, like a man who knows
everything that happens in the world. 

A cucumber is bitter.- Throw it away.- There are briars in the road.-
Turn aside from them.- This is enough. Do not add, And why were such
things made in the world? For thou wilt be ridiculed by a man who
is acquainted with nature, as thou wouldst be ridiculed by a carpenter
and shoemaker if thou didst find fault because thou seest in their
workshop shavings and cuttings from the things which they make. And
yet they have places into which they can throw these shavings and
cuttings, and the universal nature has no external space; but the
wondrous part of her art is that though she has circumscribed herself,
everything within her which appears to decay and to grow old and to
be useless she changes into herself, and again makes other new things
from these very same, so that she requires neither substance from
without nor wants a place into which she may cast that which decays.
She is content then with her own space, and her own matter and her
own art. 

Neither in thy actions be sluggish nor in thy conversation without
method, nor wandering in thy thoughts, nor let there be in thy soul
inward contention nor external effusion, nor in life be so busy as
to have no leisure. 

Suppose that men kill thee, cut thee in pieces, curse thee. What then
can these things do to prevent thy mind from remaining pure, wise,
sober, just? For instance, if a man should stand by a limpid pure
spring, and curse it, the spring never ceases sending up potable water;
and if he should cast clay into it or filth, it will speedily disperse
them and wash them out, and will not be at all polluted. How then
shalt thou possess a perpetual fountain and not a mere well? By forming
thyself hourly to freedom conjoined with contentment, simplicity and
modesty. 

He who does not know what the world is, does not know where he is.
And he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not
know who he is, nor what the world is. But he who has failed in any
one of these things could not even say for what purpose he exists
himself. What then dost thou think of him who avoids or seeks the
praise of those who applaud, of men who know not either where they
are or who they are? 

Dost thou wish to be praised by a man who curses himself thrice every
hour? Wouldst thou wish to please a man who does not please himself?
Does a man please himself who repents of nearly everything that he
does? 

No longer let thy breathing only act in concert with the air which
surrounds thee, but let thy intelligence also now be in harmony with
the intelligence which embraces all things. For the intelligent power
is no less diffused in all parts and pervades all things for him who
is willing to draw it to him than the aerial power for him who is
able to respire it. 

Generally, wickedness does no harm at all to the universe; and particularly,
the wickedness of one man does no harm to another. It is only harmful
to him who has it in his power to be released from it, as soon as
he shall choose. 

To my own free will the free will of my neighbour is just as indifferent
as his poor breath and flesh. For though we are made especially for
the sake of one another, still the ruling power of each of us has
its own office, for otherwise my neighbour's wickedness would be my
harm, which God has not willed in order that my unhappiness may not
depend on another. 

The sun appears to be poured down, and in all directions indeed it
is diffused, yet it is not effused. For this diffusion is extension:
Accordingly its rays are called Extensions [aktines] because they
are extended [apo tou ekteinesthai]. But one may judge what kind of
a thing a ray is, if he looks at the sun's light passing through a
narrow opening into a darkened room, for it is extended in a right
line, and as it were is divided when it meets with any solid body
which stands in the way and intercepts the air beyond; but there the
light remains fixed and does not glide or fall off. Such then ought
to be the out-pouring and diffusion of the understanding, and it should
in no way be an effusion, but an extension, and it should make no
violent or impetuous collision with the obstacles which are in its
way; nor yet fall down, but be fixed and enlighten that which receives
it. For a body will deprive itself of the illumination, if it does
not admit it. 

He who fears death either fears the loss of sensation or a different
kind of sensation. But if thou shalt have no sensation, neither wilt
thou feel any harm; and if thou shalt acquire another kind of sensation,
thou wilt be a different kind of living being and thou wilt not cease
to live. 

Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them then or bear with
them. 

In one way an arrow moves, in another way the mind. The mind indeed,
both when it exercises caution and when it is employed about inquiry,
moves straight onward not the less, and to its object. 

Enter into every man's ruling faculty; and also let every other man
enter into thine. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK NINE

He ho acts unjustly acts impiously. For since the universal nature
has made rational animals for the sake of one another to help one
another according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another,
he who transgresses her will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards
the highest divinity. And he too who lies is guilty of impiety to
the same divinity; for the universal nature is the nature of things
that are; and things that are have a relation to all things that come
into existence. And further, this universal nature is named truth,
and is the prime cause of all things that are true. He then who lies
intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by
deceiving; and he also who lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is
at variance with the universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs
the order by fighting against the nature of the world; for he fights
against it, who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth,
for he had received powers from nature through the neglect of which
he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed
he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty
of impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find fault with
the universal nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and
the good contrary to their deserts, because frequently the bad are
in the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things which procure
pleasure, but the good have pain for their share and the things which
cause pain. And further, he who is afraid of pain will sometimes also
be afraid of some of the things which will happen in the world, and
even this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain
from injustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the
things towards which the universal nature is equally affected- for
it would not have made both, unless it was equally affected towards
both- towards these they who wish to follow nature should be of the
same mind with it, and equally affected. With respect to pain, then,
and pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour, which the
universal nature employs equally, whoever is not equally affected
is manifestly acting impiously. And I say that the universal nature
employs them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to
those who are produced in continuous series and to those who come
after them by virtue of a certain original movement of Providence,
according to which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering
of things, having conceived certain principles of the things which
were to be, and having determined powers productive of beings and
of changes and of such like successions. 

It would be a man's happiest lot to depart from mankind without having
had any taste of lying and hypocrisy and luxury and pride. However
to breathe out one's life when a man has had enough of these things
is the next best voyage, as the saying is. Hast thou determined to
abide with vice, and has not experience yet induced thee to fly from
this pestilence? For the destruction of the understanding is a pestilence,
much more indeed than any such corruption and change of this atmosphere
which surrounds us. For this corruption is a pestilence of animals
so far as they are animals; but the other is a pestilence of men so
far as they are men. 

Do not despise death, but be well content with it, since this too
is one of those things which nature wills. For such as it is to be
young and to grow old, and to increase and to reach maturity, and
to have teeth and beard and grey hairs, and to beget, and to be pregnant
and to bring forth, and all the other natural operations which the
seasons of thy life bring, such also is dissolution. This, then, is
consistent with the character of a reflecting man, to be neither careless
nor impatient nor contemptuous with respect to death, but to wait
for it as one of the operations of nature. As thou now waitest for
the time when the child shall come out of thy wife's womb, so be ready
for the time when thy soul shall fall out of this envelope. But if
thou requirest also a vulgar kind of comfort which shall reach thy
heart, thou wilt be made best reconciled to death by observing the
objects from which thou art going to be removed, and the morals of
those with whom thy soul will no longer be mingled. For it is no way
right to be offended with men, but it is thy duty to care for them
and to bear with them gently; and yet to remember that thy departure
will be not from men who have the same principles as thyself. For
this is the only thing, if there be any, which could draw us the contrary
way and attach us to life, to be permitted to live with those who
have the same principles as ourselves. But now thou seest how great
is the trouble arising from the discordance of those who live together,
so that thou mayest say, Come quick, O death, lest perchance I, too,
should forget myself. 

He who does wrong does wrong against himself. He who acts unjustly
acts unjustly to himself, because he makes himself bad. 

He often acts unjustly who does not do a certain thing; not only he
who does a certain thing. 

Thy present opinion founded on understanding, and thy present conduct
directed to social good, and thy present disposition of contentment
with everything which happens- that is enough. 

Wipe out imagination: check desire: extinguish appetite: keep the
ruling faculty in its own power. 

Among the animals which have not reason one life is distributed; but
among reasonable animals one intelligent soul is distributed: just
as there is one earth of all things which are of an earthy nature,
and we see by one light, and breathe one air, all of us that have
the faculty of vision and all that have life. 

All things which participate in anything which is common to them all
move towards that which is of the same kind with themselves. Everything
which is earthy turns towards the earth, everything which is liquid
flows together, and everything which is of an aerial kind does the
same, so that they require something to keep them asunder, and the
application of force. Fire indeed moves upwards on account of the
elemental fire, but it is so ready to be kindled together with all
the fire which is here, that even every substance which is somewhat
dry, is easily ignited, because there is less mingled with it of that
which is a hindrance to ignition. Accordingly then everything also
which participates in the common intelligent nature moves in like
manner towards that which is of the same kind with itself, or moves
even more. For so much as it is superior in comparison with all other
things, in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle with and
to be fused with that which is akin to it. Accordingly among animals
devoid of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and
the nurture of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for even in animals
there are souls, and that power which brings them together is seen
to exert itself in the superior degree, and in such a way as never
has been observed in plants nor in stones nor in trees. But in rational
animals there are political communities and friendships, and families
and meetings of people; and in wars, treaties and armistices. But
in the things which are still superior, even though they are separated
from one another, unity in a manner exists, as in the stars. Thus
the ascent to the higher degree is able to produce a sympathy even
in things which are separated. See, then, what now takes place. For
only intelligent animals have now forgotten this mutual desire and
inclination, and in them alone the property of flowing together is
not seen. But still though men strive to avoid this union, they are
caught and held by it, for their nature is too strong for them; and
thou wilt see what I say, if thou only observest. Sooner, then, will
one find anything earthy which comes in contact with no earthy thing
than a man altogether separated from other men. 

Both man and God and the universe produce fruit; at the proper seasons
each produces it. But if usage has especially fixed these terms to
the vine and like things, this is nothing. Reason produces fruit both
for all and for itself, and there are produced from it other things
of the same kind as reason itself. 

If thou art able, correct by teaching those who do wrong; but if thou
canst not, remember that indulgence is given to thee for this purpose.
And the gods, too, are indulgent to such persons; and for some purposes
they even help them to get health, wealth, reputation; so kind they
are. And it is in thy power also; or say, who hinders thee?

Labour not as one who is wretched, nor yet as one who would be pitied
or admired: but direct thy will to one thing only, to put thyself
in motion and to check thyself, as the social reason requires.

To-day I have got out of all trouble, or rather I have cast out all
trouble, for it was not outside, but within and in my opinions.

All things are the same, familiar in experience, and ephemeral in
time, and worthless in the matter. Everything now is just as it was
in the time of those whom we have buried. 

Things stand outside of us, themselves by themselves, neither knowing
aught of themselves, nor expressing any judgement. What is it, then,
which does judge about them? The ruling faculty. 

Not in passivity, but in activity lie the evil and the good of the
rational social animal, just as his virtue and his vice lie not in
passivity, but in activity. 

For the stone which has been thrown up it is no evil to come down,
nor indeed any good to have been carried up. 

Penetrate inwards into men's leading principles, and thou wilt see
what judges thou art afraid of, and what kind of judges they are of
themselves. 

All things are changing: and thou thyself art in continuous mutation
and in a manner in continuous destruction, and the whole universe
too. 

It is thy duty to leave another man's wrongful act there where it
is. 

Termination of activity, cessation from movement and opinion, and
in a sense their death, is no evil. Turn thy thoughts now to the consideration
of thy life, thy life as a child, as a youth, thy manhood, thy old
age, for in these also every change was a death. Is this anything
to fear? Turn thy thoughts now to thy life under thy grandfather,
then to thy life under thy mother, then to thy life under thy father;
and as thou findest many other differences and changes and terminations,
ask thyself, Is this anything to fear? In like manner, then, neither
are the termination and cessation and change of thy whole life a thing
to be afraid of. 

Hasten to examine thy own ruling faculty and that of the universe
and that of thy neighbour: thy own that thou mayest make it just:
and that of the universe, that thou mayest remember of what thou art
a part; and that of thy neighbour, that thou mayest know whether he
has acted ignorantly or with knowledge, and that thou mayest also
consider that his ruling faculty is akin to thine. 

As thou thyself art a component part of a social system, so let every
act of thine be a component part of social life. Whatever act of thine
then has no reference either immediately or remotely to a social end,
this tears asunder thy life, and does not allow it to be one, and
it is of the nature of a mutiny, just as when in a popular assembly
a man acting by himself stands apart from the general agreement.

Quarrels of little children and their sports, and poor spirits carrying
about dead bodies, such is everything; and so what is exhibited in
the representation of the mansions of the dead strikes our eyes more
clearly. 

Examine into the quality of the form of an object, and detach it altogether
from its material part, and then contemplate it; then determine the
time, the longest which a thing of this peculiar form is naturally
made to endure. 

Thou hast endured infinite troubles through not being contented with
thy ruling faculty, when it does the things which it is constituted
by nature to do. But enough of this. 

When another blames thee or hates thee, or when men say about thee
anything injurious, approach their poor souls, penetrate within, and
see what kind of men they are. Thou wilt discover that there is no
reason to take any trouble that these men may have this or that opinion
about thee. However thou must be well disposed towards them, for by
nature they are friends. And the gods too aid them in all ways, by
dreams, by signs, towards the attainment of those things on which
they set a value. 

The periodic movements of the universe are the same, up and down from
age to age. And either the universal intelligence puts itself in motion
for every separate effect, and if this is so, be thou content with
that which is the result of its activity; or it puts itself in motion
once, and everything else comes by way of sequence in a manner; or
indivisible elements are the origin of all things.- In a word, if
there is a god, all is well; and if chance rules, do not thou also
be governed by it. 

Soon will the earth cover us all: then the earth, too, will change,
and the things also which result from change will continue to change
for ever, and these again for ever. For if a man reflects on the changes
and transformations which follow one another like wave after wave
and their rapidity, he will despise everything which is perishable.

The universal cause is like a winter torrent: it carries everything
along with it. But how worthless are all these poor people who are
engaged in matters political, and, as they suppose, are playing the
philosopher! All drivellers. Well then, man: do what nature now requires.
Set thyself in motion, if it is in thy power, and do not look about
thee to see if any one will observe it; nor yet expect Plato's Republic:
but be content if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such
an event to be no small matter. For who can change men's opinions?
And without a change of opinions what else is there than the slavery
of men who groan while they pretend to obey? Come now and tell me
of Alexander and Philip and Demetrius of Phalerum. They themselves
shall judge whether they discovered what the common nature required,
and trained themselves accordingly. But if they acted like tragedy
heroes, no one has condemned me to imitate them. Simple and modest
is the work of philosophy. Draw me not aside to indolence and pride.

Look down from above on the countless herds of men and their countless
solemnities, and the infinitely varied voyagings in storms and calms,
and the differences among those who are born, who live together, and
die. And consider, too, the life lived by others in olden time, and
the life of those who will live after thee, and the life now lived
among barbarous nations, and how many know not even thy name, and
how many will soon forget it, and how they who perhaps now are praising
thee will very soon blame thee, and that neither a posthumous name
is of any value, nor reputation, nor anything else. 

Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to the things
which come from the external cause; and let there be justice in the
things done by virtue of the internal cause, that is, let there be
movement and action terminating in this, in social acts, for this
is according to thy nature. 

Thou canst remove out of the way many useless things among those which
disturb thee, for they lie entirely in thy opinion; and thou wilt
then gain for thyself ample space by comprehending the whole universe
in thy mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing
the rapid change of every several thing, how short is the time from
birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well
as the equally boundless time after dissolution. 

All that thou seest will quickly perish, and those who have been spectators
of its dissolution will very soon perish too. And he who dies at the
extremest old age will be brought into the same condition with him
who died prematurely. 

What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of things
are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honour?
Imagine that thou seest their poor souls laid bare. When they think
that they do harm by their blame or good by their praise, what an
idea! 

Loss is nothing else than change. But the universal nature delights
in change, and in obedience to her all things are now done well, and
from eternity have been done in like form, and will be such to time
without end. What, then, dost thou say? That all things have been
and all things always will be bad, and that no power has ever been
found in so many gods to rectify these things, but the world has been
condemned to be found in never ceasing evil? 

The rottenness of the matter which is the foundation of everything!
Water, dust, bones, filth: or again, marble rocks, the callosities
of the earth; and gold and silver, the sediments; and garments, only
bits of hair; and purple dye, blood; and everything else is of the
same kind. And that which is of the nature of breath is also another
thing of the same kind, changing from this to that. 

Enough of this wretched life and murmuring and apish tricks. Why art
thou disturbed? What is there new in this? What unsettles thee? Is
it the form of the thing? Look at it. Or is it the matter? Look at
it. But besides these there is nothing. Towards the gods, then, now
become at last more simple and better. It is the same whether we examine
these things for a hundred years or three. 

If any man has done wrong, the harm is his own. But perhaps he has
not done wrong. 

Either all things proceed from one intelligent source and come together
as in one body, and the part ought not to find fault with what is
done for the benefit of the whole; or there are only atoms, and nothing
else than mixture and dispersion. Why, then, art thou disturbed? Say
to the ruling faculty, Art thou dead, art thou corrupted, art thou
playing the hypocrite, art thou become a beast, dost thou herd and
feed with the rest? 

Either the gods have no power or they have power. If, then, they have
no power, why dost thou pray to them? But if they have power, why
dost thou not pray for them to give thee the faculty of not fearing
any of the things which thou fearest, or of not desiring any of the
things which thou desirest, or not being pained at anything, rather
than pray that any of these things should not happen or happen? for
certainly if they can co-operate with men, they can co-operate for
these purposes. But perhaps thou wilt say, the gods have placed them
in thy power. Well, then, is it not better to use what is in thy power
like a free man than to desire in a slavish and abject way what is
not in thy power? And who has told thee that the gods do not aid us
even in the things which are in our power? Begin, then, to pray for
such things, and thou wilt see. One man prays thus: How shall I be
able to lie with that woman? Do thou pray thus: How shall I not desire
to lie with her? Another prays thus: How shall I be released from
this? Another prays: How shall I not desire to be released? Another
thus: How shall I not lose my little son? Thou thus: How shall I not
be afraid to lose him? In fine, turn thy prayers this way, and see
what comes. 

Epicurus says, In my sickness my conversation was not about my bodily
sufferings, nor, says he, did I talk on such subjects to those who
visited me; but I continued to discourse on the nature of things as
before, keeping to this main point, how the mind, while participating
in such movements as go on in the poor flesh, shall be free from perturbations
and maintain its proper good. Nor did I, he says, give the physicians
an opportunity of putting on solemn looks, as if they were doing something
great, but my life went on well and happily. Do, then, the same that
he did both in sickness, if thou art sick, and in any other circumstances;
for never to desert philosophy in any events that may befall us, nor
to hold trifling talk either with an ignorant man or with one unacquainted
with nature, is a principle of all schools of philosophy; but to be
intent only on that which thou art now doing and on the instrument
by which thou doest it. 

When thou art offended with any man's shameless conduct, immediately
ask thyself, Is it possible, then, that shameless men should not be
in the world? It is not possible. Do not, then, require what is impossible.
For this man also is one of those shameless men who must of necessity
be in the world. Let the same considerations be present to thy mind
in the case of the knave, and the faithless man, and of every man
who does wrong in any way. For at the same time that thou dost remind
thyself that it is impossible that such kind of men should not exist,
thou wilt become more kindly disposed towards every one individually.
It is useful to perceive this, too, immediately when the occasion
arises, what virtue nature has given to man to oppose to every wrongful
act. For she has given to man, as an antidote against the stupid man,
mildness, and against another kind of man some other power. And in
all cases it is possible for thee to correct by teaching the man who
is gone astray; for every man who errs misses his object and is gone
astray. Besides wherein hast thou been injured? For thou wilt find
that no one among those against whom thou art irritated has done anything
by which thy mind could be made worse; but that which is evil to thee
and harmful has its foundation only in the mind. And what harm is
done or what is there strange, if the man who has not been instructed
does the acts of an uninstructed man? Consider whether thou shouldst
not rather blame thyself, because thou didst not expect such a man
to err in such a way. For thou hadst means given thee by thy reason
to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error, and
yet thou hast forgotten and art amazed that he has erred. But most
of all when thou blamest a man as faithless or ungrateful, turn to
thyself. For the fault is manifestly thy own, whether thou didst trust
that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise, or when
conferring thy kindness thou didst not confer it absolutely, nor yet
in such way as to have received from thy very act all the profit.
For what more dost thou want when thou hast done a man a service?
Art thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to
thy nature, and dost thou seek to be paid for it? Just as if the eye
demanded a recompense for seeing, or the feet for walking. For as
these members are formed for a particular purpose, and by working
according to their several constitutions obtain what is their own;
so also as man is formed by nature to acts of benevolence, when he
has done anything benevolent or in any other way conducive to the
common interest, he has acted conformably to his constitution, and
he gets what is his own.

BOOK TEN

Wilt thou, then, my soul, never be good and simple and one and naked,
more manifest than the body which surrounds thee? Wilt thou never
enjoy an affectionate and contented disposition? Wilt thou never be
full and without a want of any kind, longing for nothing more, nor
desiring anything, either animate or inanimate, for the enjoyment
of pleasures? Nor yet desiring time wherein thou shalt have longer
enjoyment, or place, or pleasant climate, or society of men with whom
thou mayest live in harmony? But wilt thou be satisfied with thy present
condition, and pleased with all that is about thee, and wilt thou
convince thyself that thou hast everything and that it comes from
the gods, that everything is well for thee, and will be well whatever
shall please them, and whatever they shall give for the conservation
of the perfect living being, the good and just and beautiful, which
generates and holds together all things, and contains and embraces
all things which are dissolved for the production of other like things?
Wilt thou never be such that thou shalt so dwell in community with
gods and men as neither to find fault with them at all, nor to be
condemned by them? 

Observe what thy nature requires, so far as thou art governed by nature
only: then do it and accept it, if thy nature, so far as thou art
a living being, shall not be made worse by it. 

And next thou must observe what thy nature requires so far as thou
art a living being. And all this thou mayest allow thyself, if thy
nature, so far as thou art a rational animal, shall not be made worse
by it. But the rational animal is consequently also a political (social)
animal. Use these rules, then, and trouble thyself about nothing else.

Everything which happens either happens in such wise as thou art formed
by nature to bear it, or as thou art not formed by nature to bear
it. If, then, it happens to thee in such way as thou art formed by
nature to bear it, do not complain, but bear it as thou art formed
by nature to bear it. But if it happens in such wise as thou art not
formed by nature to bear it, do not complain, for it will perish after
it has consumed thee. Remember, however, that thou art formed by nature
to bear everything, with respect to which it depends on thy own opinion
to make it endurable and tolerable, by thinking that it is either
thy interest or thy duty to do this. 

If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error.
But if thou art not able, blame thyself, or blame not even thyself.

Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all eternity;
and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread
of thy being, and of that which is incident to it. 

Whether the universe is a concourse of atoms, or nature is a system,
let this first be established, that I am a part of the whole which
is governed by nature; next, I am in a manner intimately related to
the parts which are of the same kind with myself. For remembering
this, inasmuch as I am a part, I shall be discontented with none of
the things which are assigned to me out of the whole; for nothing
is injurious to the part, if it is for the advantage of the whole.
For the whole contains nothing which is not for its advantage; and
all natures indeed have this common principle, but the nature of the
universe has this principle besides, that it cannot be compelled even
by any external cause to generate anything harmful to itself. By remembering,
then, that I am a part of such a whole, I shall be content with everything
that happens. And inasmuch as I am in a manner intimately related
to the parts which are of the same kind with myself, I shall do nothing
unsocial, but I shall rather direct myself to the things which are
of the same kind with myself, and I shall turn an my efforts to the
common interest, and divert them from the contrary. Now, if these
things are done so, life must flow on happily, just as thou mayest
observe that the life of a citizen is happy, who continues a course
of action which is advantageous to his fellow-citizens, and is content
with whatever the state may assign to him. 

The parts of the whole, everything, I mean, which is naturally comprehended
in the universe, must of necessity perish; but let this be understood
in this sense, that they must undergo change. But if this is naturally
both an evil and a necessity for the parts, the whole would not continue
to exist in a good condition, the parts being subject to change and
constituted so as to perish in various ways. For whether did nature
herself design to do evil to the things which are parts of herself,
and to make them subject to evil and of necessity fall into evil,
or have such results happened without her knowing it? Both these suppositions,
indeed, are incredible. But if a man should even drop the term Nature
(as an efficient power), and should speak of these things as natural,
even then it would be ridiculous to affirm at the same time that the
parts of the whole are in their nature subject to change, and at the
same time to be surprised or vexed as if something were happening
contrary to nature, particularly as the dissolution of things is into
those things of which each thing is composed. For there is either
a dispersion of the elements out of which everything has been compounded,
or a change from the solid to the earthy and from the airy to the
aerial, so that these parts are taken back into the universal reason,
whether this at certain periods is consumed by fire or renewed by
eternal changes. And do not imagine that the solid and the airy part
belong to thee from the time of generation. For all this received
its accretion only yesterday and the day before, as one may say, from
the food and the air which is inspired. This, then, which has received
the accretion, changes, not that which thy mother brought forth. But
suppose that this which thy mother brought forth implicates thee very
much with that other part, which has the peculiar quality of change,
this is nothing in fact in the way of objection to what is said.

When thou hast assumed these names, good, modest, true, rational,
a man of equanimity, and magnanimous, take care that thou dost not
change these names; and if thou shouldst lose them, quickly return
to them. And remember that the term Rational was intended to signify
a discriminating attention to every several thing and freedom from
negligence; and that Equanimity is the voluntary acceptance of the
things which are assigned to thee by the common nature; and that Magnanimity
is the elevation of the intelligent part above the pleasurable or
painful sensations of the flesh, and above that poor thing called
fame, and death, and all such things. If, then, thou maintainest thyself
in the possession of these names, without desiring to be called by
these names by others, thou wilt be another person and wilt enter
on another life. For to continue to be such as thou hast hitherto
been, and to be tom in pieces and defiled in such a life, is the character
of a very stupid man and one overfond of his life, and like those
half-devoured fighters with wild beasts, who though covered with wounds
and gore, still intreat to be kept to the following day, though they
will be exposed in the same state to the same claws and bites. Therefore
fix thyself in the possession of these few names: and if thou art
able to abide in them, abide as if thou wast removed to certain islands
of the Happy. But if thou shalt perceive that thou fallest out of
them and dost not maintain thy hold, go courageously into some nook
where thou shalt maintain them, or even depart at once from life,
not in passion, but with simplicity and freedom and modesty, after
doing this one laudable thing at least in thy life, to have gone out
of it thus. In order, however, to the remembrance of these names,
it will greatly help thee, if thou rememberest the gods, and that
they wish not to be flattered, but wish all reasonable beings to be
made like themselves; and if thou rememberest that what does the work
of a fig-tree is a fig-tree, and that what does the work of a dog
is a dog, and that what does the work of a bee is a bee, and that
what does the work of a man is a man. 

Mimi, war, astonishment, torpor, slavery, will daily wipe out those
holy principles of thine. How many things without studying nature
dost thou imagine, and how many dost thou neglect? But it is thy duty
so to look on and so to do everything, that at the same time the power
of dealing with circumstances is perfected, and the contemplative
faculty is exercised, and the confidence which comes from the knowledge
of each several thing is maintained without showing it, but yet not
concealed. For when wilt thou enjoy simplicity, when gravity, and
when the knowledge of every several thing, both what it is in substance,
and what place it has in the universe, and how long it is formed to
exist and of what things it is compounded, and to whom it can belong,
and who are able both to give it and take it away? 

A spider is proud when it has caught a fly, and another when he has
caught a poor hare, and another when he has taken a little fish in
a net, and another when he has taken wild boars, and another when
he has taken bears, and another when he has taken Sarmatians. Are
not these robbers, if thou examinest their opinions? 

Acquire the contemplative way of seeing how all things change into
one another, and constantly attend to it, and exercise thyself about
this part of philosophy. For nothing is so much adapted to produce
magnanimity. Such a man has put off the body, and as he sees that
he must, no one knows how soon, go away from among men and leave everything
here, he gives himself up entirely to just doing in all his actions,
and in everything else that happens he resigns himself to the universal
nature. But as to what any man shall say or think about him or do
against him, he never even thinks of it, being himself contented with
these two things, with acting justly in what he now does, and being
satisfied with what is now assigned to him; and he lays aside all
distracting and busy pursuits, and desires nothing else than to accomplish
the straight course through the law, and by accomplishing the straight
course to follow God. 

What need is there of suspicious fear, since it is in thy power to
inquire what ought to be done? And if thou seest clear, go by this
way content, without turning back: but if thou dost not see clear,
stop and take the best advisers. But if any other things oppose thee,
go on according to thy powers with due consideration, keeping to that
which appears to be just. For it is best to reach this object, and
if thou dost fail, let thy failure be in attempting this. He who follows
reason in all things is both tranquil and active at the same time,
and also cheerful and collected. 

Inquire of thyself as soon as thou wakest from sleep, whether it will
make any difference to thee, if another does what is just and right.
It will make no difference. 

Thou hast not forgotten, I suppose, that those who assume arrogant
airs in bestowing their praise or blame on others, are such as they
are at bed and at board, and thou hast not forgotten what they do,
and what they avoid and what they pursue, and how they steal and how
they rob, not with hands and feet, but with their most valuable part,
by means of which there is produced, when a man chooses, fidelity,
modesty, truth, law, a good daemon (happiness)? 

To her who gives and takes back all, to nature, the man who is instructed
and modest says, Give what thou wilt; take back what thou wilt. And
he says this not proudly, but obediently and well pleased with her.

Short is the little which remains to thee of life. Live as on a mountain.
For it makes no difference whether a man lives there or here, if he
lives everywhere in the world as in a state (political community).
Let men see, let them know a real man who lives according to nature.
If they cannot endure him, let them kill him. For that is better than
to live thus as men do. 

No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought
to be, but be such. 

Constantly contemplate the whole of time and the whole of substance,
and consider that all individual things as to substance are a grain
of a fig, and as to time, the turning of a gimlet. 

Look at everything that exists, and observe that it is already in
dissolution and in change, and as it were putrefaction or dispersion,
or that everything is so constituted by nature as to die.

Consider what men are when they are eating, sleeping, generating,
easing themselves and so forth. Then what kind of men they are when
they are imperious and arrogant, or angry and scolding from their
elevated place. But a short time ago to how many they were slaves
and for what things; and after a little time consider in what a condition
they will be. 

That is for the good of each thing, which the universal nature brings
to each. And it is for its good at the time when nature brings it.

"The earth loves the shower"; and "the solemn aether loves": and the
universe loves to make whatever is about to be. I say then to the
universe, that I love as thou lovest. And is not this too said, that
"this or that loves (is wont) to be produced"? 

Either thou livest here and hast already accustomed thyself to it,
or thou art going away, and this was thy own will; or thou art dying
and hast discharged thy duty. But besides these things there is nothing.
Be of good cheer, then. 

Let this always be plain to thee, that this piece of land is like
any other; and that all things here are the same with things on top
of a mountain, or on the sea-shore, or wherever thou choosest to be.
For thou wilt find just what Plato says, Dwelling within the walls
of a city as in a shepherd's fold on a mountain. 

What is my ruling faculty now to me? And of what nature am I now making
it? And for what purpose am I now using it? Is it void of understanding?
Is it loosed and rent asunder from social life? Is it melted into
and mixed with the poor flesh so as to move together with it?

He who flies from his master is a runaway; but the law is master,
and he who breaks the law is a runaway. And he also who is grieved
or angry or afraid, is dissatisfied because something has been or
is or shall be of the things which are appointed by him who rules
all things, and he is Law, and assigns to every man what is fit. He
then who fears or is grieved or is angry is a runaway. 

A man deposits seed in a womb and goes away, and then another cause
takes it, and labours on it and makes a child. What a thing from such
a material! Again, the child passes food down through the throat,
and then another cause takes it and makes perception and motion, and
in fine life and strength and other things; how many and how strange
I Observe then the things which are produced in such a hidden way,
and see the power just as we see the power which carries things downwards
and upwards, not with the eyes, but still no less plainly.

Constantly consider how all things such as they now are, in time past
also were; and consider that they will be the same again. And place
before thy eyes entire dramas and stages of the same form, whatever
thou hast learned from thy experience or from older history; for example,
the whole court of Hadrian, and the whole court of Antoninus, and
the whole court of Philip, Alexander, Croesus; for all those were
such dramas as we see now, only with different actors. 

Imagine every man who is grieved at anything or discontented to be
like a pig which is sacrificed and kicks and screams. 

Like this pig also is he who on his bed in silence laments the bonds
in which we are held. And consider that only to the rational animal
is it given to follow voluntarily what happens; but simply to follow
is a necessity imposed on all. 

Severally on the occasion of everything that thou doest, pause and
ask thyself, if death is a dreadful thing because it deprives thee
of this. 

When thou art offended at any man's fault, forthwith turn to thyself
and reflect in what like manner thou dost err thyself; for example,
in thinking that money is a good thing, or pleasure, or a bit of reputation,
and the like. For by attending to this thou wilt quickly forget thy
anger, if this consideration also is added, that the man is compelled:
for what else could he do? or, if thou art able, take away from him
the compulsion. 

When thou hast seen Satyron the Socratic, think of either Eutyches
or Hymen, and when thou hast seen Euphrates, think of Eutychion or
Silvanus, and when thou hast seen Alciphron think of Tropaeophorus,
and when thou hast seen Xenophon think of Crito or Severus, and when
thou hast looked on thyself, think of any other Caesar, and in the
case of every one do in like manner. Then let this thought be in thy
mind, Where then are those men? Nowhere, or nobody knows where. For
thus continuously thou wilt look at human things as smoke and nothing
at all; especially if thou reflectest at the same time that what has
once changed will never exist again in the infinite duration of time.
But thou, in what a brief space of time is thy existence? And why
art thou not content to pass through this short time in an orderly
way? What matter and opportunity for thy activity art thou avoiding?
For what else are all these things, except exercises for the reason,
when it has viewed carefully and by examination into their nature
the things which happen in life? Persevere then until thou shalt have
made these things thy own, as the stomach which is strengthened makes
all things its own, as the blazing fire makes flame and brightness
out of everything that is thrown into it. 

Let it not be in any man's power to say truly of thee that thou art
not simple or that thou are not good; but let him be a liar whoever
shall think anything of this kind about thee; and this is altogether
in thy power. For who is he that shall hinder thee from being good
and simple? Do thou only determine to live no longer, unless thou
shalt be such. For neither does reason allow thee to live, if thou
art not such. 

What is that which as to this material (our life) can be done or said
in the way most conformable to reason. For whatever this may be, it
is in thy power to do it or to say it, and do not make excuses that
thou art hindered. Thou wilt not cease to lament till thy mind is
in such a condition that, what luxury is to those who enjoy pleasure,
such shall be to thee, in the matter which is subjected and presented
to thee, the doing of the things which are conformable to man's constitution;
for a man ought to consider as an enjoyment everything which it is
in his power to do according to his own nature. And it is in his power
everywhere. Now, it is not given to a cylinder to move everywhere
by its own motion, nor yet to water nor to fire, nor to anything else
which is governed by nature or an irrational soul, for the things
which check them and stand in the way are many. But intelligence and
reason are able to go through everything that opposes them, and in
such manner as they are formed by nature and as they choose. Place
before thy eyes this facility with which the reason will be carried
through all things, as fire upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder
down an inclined surface, and seek for nothing further. For all other
obstacles either affect the body only which is a dead thing; or, except
through opinion and the yielding of the reason itself, they do not
crush nor do any harm of any kind; for if they did, he who felt it
would immediately become bad. Now, in the case of all things which
have a certain constitution, whatever harm may happen to any of them,
that which is so affected becomes consequently worse; but in the like
case, a man becomes both better, if one may say so, and more worthy
of praise by making a right use of these accidents. And finally remember
that nothing harms him who is really a citizen, which does not harm
the state; nor yet does anything harm the state, which does not harm
law (order); and of these things which are called misfortunes not
one harms law. What then does not harm law does not harm either state
or citizen. 

To him who is penetrated by true principles even the briefest precept
is sufficient, and any common precept, to remind him that he should
be free from grief and fear. For example- 

Leaves, some the wind scatters on the ground- 
So is the race of men. Leaves, also, are thy children; and leaves,
too, are they who cry out as if they were worthy of credit and bestow
their praise, or on the contrary curse, or secretly blame and sneer;
and leaves, in like manner, are those who shall receive and transmit
a man's fame to aftertimes. For all such things as these "are produced
in the season of spring," as the poet says; then the wind casts them
down; then the forest produces other leaves in their places. But a
brief existence is common to all things, and yet thou avoidest and
pursuest all things as if they would be eternal. A little time, and
thou shalt close thy eyes; and him who has attended thee to thy grave
another soon will lament. 

The healthy eye ought to see all visible things and not to say, I
wish for green things; for this is the condition of a diseased eye.
And the healthy hearing and smelling ought to be ready to perceive
all that can be heard and smelled. And the healthy stomach ought to
be with respect to all food just as the mill with respect to all things
which it is formed to grind. And accordingly the healthy understanding
ought to be prepared for everything which happens; but that which
says, Let my dear children live, and let all men praise whatever I
may do, is an eye which seeks for green things, or teeth which seek
for soft things. 

There is no man so fortunate that there shall not be by him when he
is dying some who are pleased with what is going to happen. Suppose
that he was a good and wise man, will there not be at last some one
to say to himself, Let us at last breathe freely being relieved from
this schoolmaster? It is true that he was harsh to none of us, but
I perceived that he tacitly condemns us.- This is what is said of
a good man. But in our own case how many other things are there for
which there are many who wish to get rid of us. Thou wilt consider
this then when thou art dying, and thou wilt depart more contentedly
by reflecting thus: I am going away from such a life, in which even
my associates in behalf of whom I have striven so much, prayed, and
cared, themselves wish me to depart, hoping perchance to get some
little advantage by it. Why then should a man cling to a longer stay
here? Do not however for this reason go away less kindly disposed
to them, but preserving thy own character, and friendly and benevolent
and mild, and on the other hand not as if thou wast torn away; but
as when a man dies a quiet death, the poor soul is easily separated
from the body, such also ought thy departure from men to be, for nature
united thee to them and associated thee. But does she now dissolve
the union? Well, I am separated as from kinsmen, not however dragged
resisting, but without compulsion; for this too is one of the things
according to nature. 

Accustom thyself as much as possible on the occasion of anything being
done by any person to inquire with thyself, For what object is this
man doing this? But begin with thyself, and examine thyself first.

Remember that this which pulls the strings is the thing which is hidden
within: this is the power of persuasion, this is life, this, if one
may so say, is man. In contemplating thyself never include the vessel
which surrounds thee and these instruments which are attached about
it. For they are like to an axe, differing only in this that they
grow to the body. For indeed there is no more use in these parts without
the cause which moves and checks them than in the weaver's shuttle,
and the writer's pen and the driver's whip.

BOOK ELEVEN

These are the properties of the rational soul: it sees itself, analyses
itself, and makes itself such as it chooses; the fruit which it bears
itself enjoys- for the fruits of plants and that in animals which
corresponds to fruits others enjoy- it obtains its own end, wherever
the limit of life may be fixed. Not as in a dance and in a play and
in such like things, where the whole action is incomplete, if anything
cuts it short; but in every part and wherever it may be stopped, it
makes what has been set before it full and complete, so that it can
say, I have what is my own. And further it traverses the whole universe,
and the surrounding vacuum, and surveys its form, and it extends itself
into the infinity of time, and embraces and comprehends the periodical
renovation of all things, and it comprehends that those who come after
us will see nothing new, nor have those before us seen anything more,
but in a manner he who is forty years old, if he has any understanding
at all, has seen by virtue of the uniformity that prevails all things
which have been and all that will be. This too is a property of the
rational soul, love of one's neighbour, and truth and modesty, and
to value nothing more more than itself, which is also the property
of Law. Thus then right reason differs not at all from the reason
of justice. 

Thou wilt set little value on pleasing song and dancing and the pancratium,
if thou wilt distribute the melody of the voice into its several sounds,
and ask thyself as to each, if thou art mastered by this; for thou
wilt be prevented by shame from confessing it: and in the matter of
dancing, if at each movement and attitude thou wilt do the same; and
the like also in the matter of the pancratium. In all things, then,
except virtue and the acts of virtue, remember to apply thyself to
their several parts, and by this division to come to value them little:
and apply this rule also to thy whole life. 

What a soul that is which is ready, if at any moment it must be separated
from the body, and ready either to be extinguished or dispersed or
continue to exist; but so that this readiness comes from a man's own
judgement, not from mere obstinacy, as with the Christians, but considerately
and with dignity and in a way to persuade another, without tragic
show. 

Have I done something for the general interest? Well then I have had
my reward. Let this always be present to thy mind, and never stop
doing such good. 

What is thy art? To be good. And how is this accomplished well except
by general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and
others about the proper constitution of man? 

At first tragedies were brought on the stage as means of reminding
men of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to
nature for things to happen so, and that, if you are delighted with
what is shown on the stage, you should not be troubled with that which
takes place on the larger stage. For you see that these things must
be accomplished thus, and that even they bear them who cry out "O
Cithaeron." And, indeed, some things are said well by the dramatic
writers, of which kind is the following especially:- 

Me and my children if the gods neglect, 
This has its reason too. And again- 

We must not chale and fret at that which happens. And 

Life's harvest reap like the wheat's fruitful ear. And other things
of the same kind. 

After tragedy the old comedy was introduced, which had a magisterial
freedom of speech, and by its very plainness of speaking was useful
in reminding men to beware of insolence; and for this purpose too
Diogenes used to take from these writers. 

But as to the middle comedy which came next, observe what it was,
and again, for what object the new comedy was introduced, which gradually
sunk down into a mere mimic artifice. That some good things are said
even by these writers, everybody knows: but the whole plan of such
poetry and dramaturgy, to what end does it look! 

How plain does it appear that there is not another condition of life
so well suited for philosophising as this in which thou now happenest
to be. 

A branch cut off from the adjacent branch must of necessity be cut
off from the whole tree also. So too a man when he is separated from
another man has fallen off from the whole social community. Now as
to a branch, another cuts it off, but a man by his own act separates
himself from his neighbour when he hates him and turns away from him,
and he does not know that he has at the same time cut himself off
from the whole social system. Yet he has this privilege certainly
from Zeus who framed society, for it is in our power to grow again
to that which is near to us, and be to come a part which helps to
make up the whole. However, if it often happens, this kind of separation,
it makes it difficult for that which detaches itself to be brought
to unity and to be restored to its former condition. Finally, the
branch, which from the first grew together with the tree, and has
continued to have one life with it, is not like that which after being
cut off is then ingrafted, for this is something like what the gardeners
mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree, but that
it has not the same mind with it. 

As those who try to stand in thy way when thou art proceeding according
to right reason, will not be able to turn thee aside from thy proper
action, so neither let them drive thee from thy benevolent feelings
towards them, but be on thy guard equally in both matters, not only
in the matter of steady judgement and action, but also in the matter
of gentleness towards those who try to hinder or otherwise trouble
thee. For this also is a weakness, to be vexed at them, as well as
to be diverted from thy course of action and to give way through fear;
for both are equally deserters from their post, the man who does it
through fear, and the man who is alienated from him who is by nature
a kinsman and a friend. 

There is no nature which is inferior to art, for the arts imitate
the nature of things. But if this is so, that nature which is the
most perfect and the most comprehensive of all natures, cannot fall
short of the skill of art. Now all arts do the inferior things for
the sake of the superior; therefore the universal nature does so too.
And, indeed, hence is the origin of justice, and in justice the other
virtues have their foundation: for justice will not be observed, if
we either care for middle things (things indifferent), or are easily
deceived and careless and changeable. 

If the things do not come to thee, the pursuits and avoidances of
which disturb thee, still in a manner thou goest to them. Let then
thy judgement about them be at rest, and they will remain quiet, and
thou wilt not be seen either pursuing or avoiding. 

The spherical form of the soul maintains its figure, when it is neither
extended towards any object, nor contracted inwards, nor dispersed
nor sinks down, but is illuminated by light, by which it sees the
truth, the truth of all things and the truth that is in itself.

Suppose any man shall despise me. Let him look to that himself. But
I will look to this, that I be not discovered doing or saying anything
deserving of contempt. Shall any man hate me? Let him look to it.
But I will be mild and benevolent towards every man, and ready to
show even him his mistake, not reproachfully, nor yet as making a
display of my endurance, but nobly and honestly, like the great Phocion,
unless indeed he only assumed it. For the interior parts ought to
be such, and a man ought to be seen by the gods neither dissatisfied
with anything nor complaining. For what evil is it to thee, if thou
art now doing what is agreeable to thy own nature, and art satisfied
with that which at this moment is suitable to the nature of the universe,
since thou art a human being placed at thy post in order that what
is for the common advantage may be done in some way? 

Men despise one another and flatter one another; and men wish to raise
themselves above one another, and crouch before one another.

How unsound and insincere is he who says, I have determined to deal
with thee in a fair way.- What art thou doing, man? There is no occasion
to give this notice. It will soon show itself by acts. The voice ought
to be plainly written on the forehead. Such as a man's character is,
he immediately shows it in his eyes, just as he who is beloved forthwith
reads everything in the eyes of lovers. The man who is honest and
good ought to be exactly like a man who smells strong, so that the
bystander as soon as he comes near him must smell whether he choose
or not. But the affectation of simplicity is like a crooked stick.
Nothing is more disgraceful than a wolfish friendship (false friendship).
Avoid this most of all. The good and simple and benevolent show all
these things in the eyes, and there is no mistaking. 

As to living in the best way, this power is in the soul, if it be
indifferent to things which are indifferent. And it will be indifferent,
if it looks on each of these things separately and all together, and
if it remembers that not one of them produces in us an opinion about
itself, nor comes to us; but these things remain immovable, and it
is we ourselves who produce the judgements about them, and, as we
may say, write them in ourselves, it being in our power not to write
them, and it being in our power, if perchance these judgements have
imperceptibly got admission to our minds, to wipe them out; and if
we remember also that such attention will only be for a short time,
and then life will be at an end. Besides, what trouble is there at
all in doing this? For if these things are according to nature, rejoice
in them, and they will be easy to thee: but if contrary to nature,
seek what is conformable to thy own nature, and strive towards this,
even if it bring no reputation; for every man is allowed to seek his
own good. 

Consider whence each thing is come, and of what it consists, and into
what it changes, and what kind of a thing it will be when it has changed,
and that it will sustain no harm. 

If any have offended against thee, consider first: What is my relation
to men, and that we are made for one another; and in another respect,
I was made to be set over them, as a ram over the flock or a bull
over the herd. But examine the matter from first principles, from
this: If all things are not mere atoms, it is nature which orders
all things: if this is so, the inferior things exist for the sake
of the superior, and these for the sake of one another. 

Second, consider what kind of men they are at table, in bed, and so
forth: and particularly, under what compulsions in respect of opinions
they are; and as to their acts, consider with what pride they do what
they do. 

Third, that if men do rightly what they do, we ought not to be displeased;
but if they do not right, it is plain that they do so involuntarily
and in ignorance. For as every soul is unwillingly deprived of the
truth, so also is it unwillingly deprived of the power of behaving
to each man according to his deserts. Accordingly men are pained when
they are called unjust, ungrateful, and greedy, and in a word wrong-doers
to their neighbours. 

Fourth, consider that thou also doest many things wrong, and that
thou art a man like others; and even if thou dost abstain from certain
faults, still thou hast the disposition to commit them, though either
through cowardice, or concern about reputation, or some such mean
motive, thou dost abstain from such faults. 

Fifth, consider that thou dost not even understand whether men are
doing wrong or not, for many things are done with a certain reference
to circumstances. And in short, a man must learn a great deal to enable
him to pass a correct judgement on another man's acts. 

Sixth, consider when thou art much vexed or grieved, that man's life
is only a moment, and after a short time we are all laid out dead.

Seventh, that it is not men's acts which disturb us, for those acts
have their foundation in men's ruling principles, but it is our own
opinions which disturb us. Take away these opinions then, and resolve
to dismiss thy judgement about an act as if it were something grievous,
and thy anger is gone. How then shall I take away these opinions?
By reflecting that no wrongful act of another brings shame on thee:
for unless that which is shameful is alone bad, thou also must of
necessity do many things wrong, and become a robber and everything
else. 

Eighth, consider how much more pain is brought on us by the anger
and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves, at which
we are angry and vexed. 

Ninth, consider that a good disposition is invincible, if it be genuine,
and not an affected smile and acting a part. For what will the most
violent man do to thee, if thou continuest to be of a kind disposition
towards him, and if, as opportunity offers, thou gently admonishest
him and calmly correctest his errors at the very time when he is trying
to do thee harm, saying, Not so, my child: we are constituted by nature
for something else: I shall certainly not be injured, but thou art
injuring thyself, my child.- And show him with gentle tact and by
general principles that this is so, and that even bees do not do as
he does, nor any animals which are formed by nature to be gregarious.
And thou must do this neither with any double meaning nor in the way
of reproach, but affectionately and without any rancour in thy soul;
and not as if thou wert lecturing him, nor yet that any bystander
may admire, but either when he is alone, and if others are present...

Remember these nine rules, as if thou hadst received them as a gift
from the Muses, and begin at last to be a man while thou livest. But
thou must equally avoid flattering men and being veied at them, for
both are unsocial and lead to harm. And let this truth be present
to thee in the excitement of anger, that to be moved by passion is
not manly, but that mildness and gentleness, as they are more agreeable
to human nature, so also are they more manly; and he who possesses
these qualities possesses strength, nerves and courage, and not the
man who is subject to fits of passion and discontent. For in the same
degree in which a man's mind is nearer to freedom from all passion,
in the same degree also is it nearer to strength: and as the sense
of pain is a characteristic of weakness, so also is anger. For he
who yields to pain and he who yields to anger, both are wounded and
both submit. 

But if thou wilt, receive also a tenth present from the leader of
the Muses (Apollo), and it is this- that to expect bad men not to
do wrong is madness, for he who expects this desires an impossibility.
But to allow men to behave so to others, and to expect them not to
do thee any wrong, is irrational and tyrannical. 

There are four principal aberrations of the superior faculty against
which thou shouldst be constantly on thy guard, and when thou hast
detected them, thou shouldst wipe them out and say on each occasion
thus: this thought is not necessary: this tends to destroy social
union: this which thou art going to say comes not from the real thoughts;
for thou shouldst consider it among the most absurd of things for
a man not to speak from his real thoughts. But the fourth is when
thou shalt reproach thyself for anything, for this is an evidence
of the diviner part within thee being overpowered and yielding to
the less honourable and to the perishable part, the body, and to its
gross pleasures. 

Thy aerial part and all the fiery parts which are mingled in thee,
though by nature they have an upward tendency, still in obedience
to the disposition of the universe they are overpowered here in the
compound mass (the body). And also the whole of the earthy part in
thee and the watery, though their tendency is downward, still are
raised up and occupy a position which is not their natural one. In
this manner then the elemental parts obey the universal, for when
they have been fixed in any place perforce they remain there until
again the universal shall sound the signal for dissolution. Is it
not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient
and discontented with its own place? And yet no force is imposed on
it, but only those things which are conformable to its nature: still
it does not submit, but is carried in the opposite direction. For
the movement towards injustice and intemperance and to anger and grief
and fear is nothing else than the act of one who deviates from nature.
And also when the ruling faculty is discontented with anything that
happens, then too it deserts its post: for it is constituted for piety
and reverence towards the gods no less than for justice. For these
qualities also are comprehended under the generic term of contentment
with the constitution of things, and indeed they are prior to acts
of justice. 

He who has not one and always the same object in life, cannot be one
and the same all through his life. But what I have said is not enough,
unless this also is added, what this object ought to be. For as there
is not the same opinion about all the things which in some way or
other are considered by the majority to be good, but only about some
certain things, that is, things which concern the common interest;
so also ought we to propose to ourselves an object which shall be
of a common kind (social) and political. For he who directs all his
own efforts to this object, will make all his acts alike, and thus
will always be the same. 

Think of the country mouse and of the town mouse, and of the alarm
and trepidation of the town mouse. 

Socrates used to call the opinions of the many by the name of Lamiae,
bugbears to frighten children. 

The Lacedaemonians at their public spectacles used to set seats in
the shade for strangers, but themselves sat down anywhere.

Socrates excused himself to Perdiccas for not going to him, saying,
It is because I would not perish by the worst of all ends, that is,
I would not receive a favour and then be unable to return it.

In the writings of the Ephesians there was this precept, constantly
to think of some one of the men of former times who practised virtue.

The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that we
may be reminded of those bodies which continually do the same things
and in the same manner perform their work, and also be reminded of
their purity and nudity. For there is no veil over a star.

Consider what a man Socrates was when he dressed himself in a skin,
after Xanthippe had taken his cloak and gone out, and what Socrates
said to his friends who were ashamed of him and drew back from him
when they saw him dressed thus. 

Neither in writing nor in reading wilt thou be able to lay down rules
for others before thou shalt have first learned to obey rules thyself.
Much more is this so in life. 

A slave thou art: free speech is not for thee. 
And my heart laughed within. 
And virtue they will curse, speaking harsh words. 
To look for the fig in winter is a madman's act: such is he who looks
for his child when it is no longer allowed. 

When a man kisses his child, said Epictetus, he should whisper to
himself, "To-morrow perchance thou wilt die."- But those are words
of bad omen.- "No word is a word of bad omen," said Epictetus, "which
expresses any work of nature; or if it is so, it is also a word of
bad omen to speak of the ears of corn being reaped." 

The unripe grape, the ripe bunch, the dried grape, all are changes,
not into nothing, but into something which exists not yet.

No man can rob us of our free will. 
Epictetus also said, A man must discover an art (or rules) with respect
to giving his assent; and in respect to his movements he must be careful
that they be made with regard to circumstances, that they be consistent
with social interests, that they have regard to the value of the object;
and as to sensual desire, he should altogether keep away from it;
and as to avoidance (aversion) he should not show it with respect
to any of the things which are not in our power. 

The dispute then, he said, is not about any common matter, but about
being mad or not. 

Socrates used to say, What do you want? Souls of rational men or irrational?-
Souls of rational men.- Of what rational men? Sound or unsound?- Sound.-
Why then do you not seek for them?- Because we have them.- Why then
do you fight and quarrel? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK TWELVE

All those things at which thou wishest to arrive by a circuitous
road, thou canst have now, if thou dost not refuse them to thyself.
And this means, if thou wilt take no notice of all the past, and trust
the future to providence, and direct the present only conformably
to piety and justice. Conformably to piety, that thou mayest be content
with the lot which is assigned to thee, for nature designed it for
thee and thee for it. Conformably to justice, that thou mayest always
speak the truth freely and without disguise, and do the things which
are agreeable to law and according to the worth of each. And let neither
another man's wickedness hinder thee, nor opinion nor voice, nor yet
the sensations of the poor flesh which has grown about thee; for the
passive part will look to this. If then, whatever the time may be
when thou shalt be near to thy departure, neglecting everything else
thou shalt respect only thy ruling faculty and the divinity within
thee, and if thou shalt be afraid not because thou must some time
cease to live, but if thou shalt fear never to have begun to live
according to nature- then thou wilt be a man worthy of the universe
which has produced thee, and thou wilt cease to be a stranger in thy
native land, and to wonder at things which happen daily as if they
were something unexpected, and to be dependent on this or that.

God sees the minds (ruling principles) of all men bared of the material
vesture and rind and impurities. For with his intellectual part alone
he touches the intelligence only which has flowed and been derived
from himself into these bodies. And if thou also usest thyself to
do this, thou wilt rid thyself of thy much trouble. For he who regards
not the poor flesh which envelops him, surely will not trouble himself
by looking after raiment and dwelling and fame and such like externals
and show. 

The things are three of which thou art composed, a little body, a
little breath (life), intelligence. Of these the first two are thine,
so far as it is thy duty to take care of them; but the third alone
is properly thine. Therefore if thou shalt separate from thyself,
that is, from thy understanding, whatever others do or say, and whatever
thou hast done or said thyself, and whatever future things trouble
thee because they may happen, and whatever in the body which envelops
thee or in the breath (life), which is by nature associated with the
body, is attached to thee independent of thy will, and whatever the
external circumfluent vortex whirls round, so that the intellectual
power exempt from the things of fate can live pure and free by itself,
doing what is just and accepting what happens and saying the truth:
if thou wilt separate, I say, from this ruling faculty the things
which are attached to it by the impressions of sense, and the things
of time to come and of time that is past, and wilt make thyself like
Empedocles' sphere, 

All round, and in its joyous rest reposing; and if thou shalt strive
to live only what is really thy life, that is, the present- then thou
wilt be able to pass that portion of life which remains for thee up
to the time of thy death, free from perturbations, nobly, and obedient
to thy own daemon (to the god that is within thee). 

I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more
than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion
of himself than on the opinion of others. If then a god or a wise
teacher should present himself to a man and bid him to think of nothing
and to design nothing which he would not express as soon as he conceived
it, he could not endure it even for a single day. So much more respect
have we to what our neighbours shall think of us than to what we shall
think of ourselves. 

How can it be that the gods after having arranged all things well
and benevolently for mankind, have overlooked this alone, that some
men and very good men, and men who, as we may say, have had most communion
with the divinity, and through pious acts and religious observances
have been most intimate with the divinity, when they have once died
should never exist again, but should be completely extinguished?

But if this is so, be assured that if it ought to have been otherwise,
the gods would have done it. For if it were just, it would also be
possible; and if it were according to nature, nature would have had
it so. But because it is not so, if in fact it is not so, be thou
convinced that it ought not to have been so:- for thou seest even
of thyself that in this inquiry thou art disputing with the diety;
and we should not thus dispute with the gods, unless they were most
excellent and most just;- but if this is so, they would not have allowed
anything in the ordering of the universe to be neglected unjustly
and irrationally. 

Practise thyself even in the things which thou despairest of accomplishing.
For even the left hand, which is ineffectual for all other things
for want of practice, holds the bridle more vigorously than the right
hand; for it has been practised in this. 

Consider in what condition both in body and soul a man should be when
he is overtaken by death; and consider the shortness of life, the
boundless abyss of time past and future, the feebleness of all matter.

Contemplate the formative principles (forms) of things bare of their
coverings; the purposes of actions; consider what pain is, what pleasure
is, and death, and fame; who is to himself the cause of his uneasiness;
how no man is hindered by another; that everything is opinion.

In the application of thy principles thou must be like the pancratiast,
not like the gladiator; for the gladiator lets fall the sword which
he uses and is killed; but the other always has his hand, and needs
to do nothing else than use it. 

See what things are in themselves, dividing them into matter, form
and purpose. 

What a power man has to do nothing except what God will approve, and
to accept all that God may give him. 

With respect to that which happens conformably to nature, we ought
to blame neither gods, for they do nothing wrong either voluntarily
or involuntarily, nor men, for they do nothing wrong except involuntarily.
Consequently we should blame nobody. 

How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything
which happens in life. 

Either there is a fatal necessity and invincible order, or a kind
Providence, or a confusion without a purpose and without a director
(Book IV). If then there is an invincible necessity, why dost thou
resist? But if there is a Providence which allows itself to be propitiated,
make thyself worthy of the help of the divinity. But if there is a
confusion without governor, be content that in such a tempest thou
hast in thyself a certain ruling intelligence. And even if the tempest
carry thee away, let it carry away the poor flesh, the poor breath,
everything else; for the intelligence at least it will not carry away.

Does the light of the lamp shine without losing its splendour until
it is extinguished; and shall the truth which is in thee and justice
and temperance be extinguished before thy death? 

When a man has presented the appearance of having done wrong, say,
How then do I know if this is a wrongful act? And even if he has done
wrong, how do I know that he has not condemned himself? and so this
is like tearing his own face. Consider that he, who would not have
the bad man do wrong, is like the man who would not have the fig-tree
to bear juice in the figs and infants to cry and the horse to neigh,
and whatever else must of necessity be. For what must a man do who
has such a character? If then thou art irritable, cure this man's
disposition. 

If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say it.
For let thy efforts be- 

In everything always observe what the thing is which produces for
thee an appearance, and resolve it by dividing it into the formal,
the material, the purpose, and the time within which it must end.

Perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better and more
divine than the things which cause the various affects, and as it
were pull thee by the strings. What is there now in my mind? Is it
fear, or suspicion, or desire, or anything of the kind? 

First, do nothing inconsiderately, nor without a purpose. Second,
make thy acts refer to nothing else than to a social end.

Consider that before long thou wilt be nobody and nowhere, nor will
any of the things exist which thou now seest, nor any of those who
are now living. For all things are formed by nature to change and
be turned and to perish in order that other things in continuous succession
may exist. 

Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in thy power.
Take away then, when thou choosest, thy opinion, and like a mariner,
who has doubled the promontory, thou wilt find calm, everything stable,
and a waveless bay. 

Any one activity whatever it may be, when it has ceased at its proper
time, suffers no evil because it has ceased; nor he who has done this
act, does he suffer any evil for this reason that the act has ceased.
In like manner then the whole which consists of all the acts, which
is our life, if it cease at its proper time, suffers no evil for this
reason that it has ceased; nor he who has terminated this series at
the proper time, has he been ill dealt with. But the proper time and
the limit nature fixes, sometimes as in old age the peculiar nature
of man, but always the universal nature, by the change of whose parts
the whole universe continues ever young and perfect. And everything
which is useful to the universal is always good and in season. Therefore
the termination of life for every man is no evil, because neither
is it shameful, since it is both independent of the will and not opposed
to the general interest, but it is good, since it is seasonable and
profitable to and congruent with the universal. For thus too he is
moved by the deity who is moved in the same manner with the deity
and moved towards the same things in his mind. 

These three principles thou must have in readiness. In the things
which thou doest do nothing either inconsiderately or otherwise than
as justice herself would act; but with respect to what may happen
to thee from without, consider that it happens either by chance or
according to Providence, and thou must neither blame chance nor accuse
Providence. Second, consider what every being is from the seed to
the time of its receiving a soul, and from the reception of a soul
to the giving back of the same, and of what things every being is
compounded and into what things it is resolved. Third, if thou shouldst
suddenly be raised up above the earth, and shouldst look down on human
things, and observe the variety of them how great it is, and at the
same time also shouldst see at a glance how great is the number of
beings who dwell around in the air and the aether, consider that as
often as thou shouldst be raised up, thou wouldst see the same things,
sameness of form and shortness of duration. Are these things to be
proud of? 

Cast away opinion: thou art saved. Who then hinders thee from casting
it away? 

When thou art troubled about anything, thou hast forgotten this, that
all things happen according to the universal nature; and forgotten
this, that a man's wrongful act is nothing to thee; and further thou
hast forgotten this, that everything which happens, always happened
so and will happen so, and now happens so everywhere; forgotten this
too, how close is the kinship between a man and the whole human race,
for it is a community, not of a little blood or seed, but of intelligence.
And thou hast forgotten this too, that every man's intelligence is
a god, and is an efflux of the deity; and forgotten this, that nothing
is a man's own, but that his child and his body and his very soul
came from the deity; forgotten this, that everything is opinion; and
lastly thou hast forgotten that every man lives the present time only,
and loses only this. 

Constantly bring to thy recollection those who have complained greatly
about anything, those who have been most conspicuous by the greatest
fame or misfortunes or enmities or fortunes of any kind: then think
where are they all now? Smoke and ash and a tale, or not even a tale.
And let there be present to thy mind also everything of this sort,
how Fabius Catullinus lived in the country, and Lucius Lupus in his
gardens, and Stertinius at Baiae, and Tiberius at Capreae and Velius
Rufus (or Rufus at Velia); and in fine think of the eager pursuit
of anything conjoined with pride; and how worthless everything is
after which men violently strain; and how much more philosophical
it is for a man in the opportunities presented to him to show

The Discourses
By Epictetus



----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK ONE

Chapter 1 

Of the things which are in our Power, and not in our Power

Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplating
itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving.
How far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power? As
far as forming a judgement about what is written and spoken. And how
far music? As far as judging about melody. Does either of them then
contemplate itself? By no means. But when you must write something
to your friend, grammar will tell you what words you must write; but
whether you should write or not, grammar will not tell you. And so
it is with music as to musical sounds; but whether you should sing
at the present time and play on the lute, or do neither, music will
not tell you. What faculty then will tell you? That which contemplates
both itself and all other things. And what is this faculty? The rational
faculty; for this is the only faculty that we have received which
examines itself, what it is, and what power it has, and what is the
value of this gift, and examines all other faculties: for what else
is there which tells us that golden things are beautiful, for they
do not say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is capable
of judging of appearances. What else judges of music, grammar, and
other faculties, proves their uses and points out the occasions for
using them? Nothing else. 

As then it was fit to be so, that which is best of all and supreme
over all is the only thing which the gods have placed in our power,
the right use of appearances; but all other things they have not placed
in our power. Was it because they did not choose? I indeed think that,
if they had been able, they would have put these other things also
in our power, but they certainly could not. For as we exist on the
earth, and are bound to such a body and to such companions, how was
it possible for us not to be hindered as to these things by externals?

But what says Zeus? "Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have
made both your little body and your little property free and not exposed
to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is not yours,
but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to do for
you what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion of us,
this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the faculty
of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using the appearances
of things; and if you will take care of this faculty and consider
it your only possession, you will never be hindered, never meet with
impediments; you will not lament, you will not blame, you will not
flatter any person." 

"Well, do these seem to you small matters?" I hope not. "Be content
with them then and pray to the gods." But now when it is in our power
to look after one thing, and to attach ourselves to it, we prefer
to look after many things, and to be bound to many things, to the
body and to property, and to brother and to friend, and to child and
to slave. Since, then, we are bound to many things, we are depressed
by them and dragged down. For this reason, when the weather is not
fit for sailing, we sit down and torment ourselves, and continually
look out to see what wind is blowing. "It is north." What is that
to us? "When will the west wind blow?" When it shall choose, my good
man, or when it shall please AEolus; for God has not made you the
manager of the winds, but AEolus. What then? We must make the best
use that we can of the things which are in our power, and use the
rest according to their nature. What is their nature then? As God
may please. 

"Must I, then, alone have my head cut off?" What, would you have all
men lose their heads that you may be consoled? Will you not stretch
out your neck as Lateranus did at Rome when Nero ordered him to be
beheaded? For when he had stretched out his neck, and received a feeble
blow, which made him draw it in for a moment, he stretched it out
again. And a little before, when he was visited by Epaphroditus, Nero's
freedman, who asked him about the cause of offense which he had given,
he said, "If I choose to tell anything, I will tell your master."

What then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances? What
else than "What is mine, and what is not mine; and permitted to me,
and what is not permitted to me." I must die. Must I then die lamenting?
I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile.
Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness
and contentment? "Tell me the secret which you possess." I will not,
for this is in my power. "But I will put you in chains." Man, what
are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg, but my
will not even Zeus himself can overpower. "I will throw you into prison."
My poor body, you mean. "I will cut your head off." When, then, have
I told you that my head alone cannot be cut off? These are the things
which philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily,
in which they should exercise themselves. 

Thrasea used to say, "I would rather be killed to-day than banished
to-morrow." What, then, did Rufus say to him? "If you choose death
as the heavier misfortune, how great is the folly of your choice?
But if, as the lighter, who has given you the choice? Will you not
study to be content with that which has been given to you?"

What, then, did Agrippinus say? He said, "I am not a hindrance to
myself." When it was reported to him that his trial was going on in
the Senate, he said, "I hope it may turn out well; but it is the fifth
hour of the day"- this was the time when he was used to exercise himself
and then take the cold bath- "let us go and take our exercise." After
he had taken his exercise, one comes and tells him, "You have been
condemned." "To banishment," he replies, "or to death?" "To banishment."
"What about my property?" "It is not taken from you." "Let us go to
Aricia then," he said, "and dine." 

This it is to have studied what a man ought to study; to have made
desire, aversion, free from hindrance, and free from all that a man
would avoid. I must die. If now, I am ready to die. If, after a short
time, I now dine because it is the dinner-hour; after this I will
then die. How? Like a man who gives up what belongs to another.

Chapter 2

How a Man on every occasion can maintain his Proper Character

To the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable; but that
which is rational is tolerable. Blows are not naturally intolerable.
"How is that?" See how the Lacedaemonians endure whipping when they
have learned that whipping is consistent with reason. "To hang yourself
is not intolerable." When, then, you have the opinion that it is rational,
you go and hang yourself. In short, if we observe, we shall find that
the animal man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational;
and, on the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that which
is rational. 

But the rational and the irrational appear such in a different way
to different persons, just as the good and the bad, the profitable
and the unprofitable. For this reason, particularly, we need discipline,
in order to learn how to adapt the preconception of the rational and
the irrational to the several things conformably to nature. But in
order to determine the rational and the irrational, we use not only
the of external things, but we consider also what is appropriate to
each person. For to one man it is consistent with reason to hold a
chamber pot for another, and to look to this only, that if he does
not hold it, he will receive stripes, and he will not receive his
food: but if he shall hold the pot, he will not suffer anything hard
or disagreeable. But to another man not only does the holding of a
chamber pot appear intolerable for himself, but intolerable also for
him to allow another to do this office for him. If, then, you ask
me whether you should hold the chamber pot or not, I shall say to
you that the receiving of food is worth more than the not receiving
of it, and the being scourged is a greater indignity than not being
scourged; so that if you measure your interests by these things, go
and hold the chamber pot. "But this," you say, "would not be worthy
of me." Well, then, it is you who must introduce this consideration
into the inquiry, not I; for it is you who know yourself, how much
you are worth to yourself, and at what price you sell yourself; for
men sell themselves at various prices. 

For this reason, when Florus was deliberating whether he should go
down to Nero's spectacles and also perform in them himself, Agrippinus
said to him, "Go down": and when Florus asked Agrippinus, "Why do
not you go down?" Agrippinus replied, "Because I do not even deliberate
about the matter." For he who has once brought himself to deliberate
about such matters, and to calculate the value of external things,
comes very near to those who have forgotten their own character. For
why do you ask me the question, whether death is preferable or life?
I say "life." "Pain or pleasure?" I say "pleasure." But if I do not
take a part in the tragic acting, I shall have my head struck off.
Go then and take a part, but I will not. "Why?" Because you consider
yourself to be only one thread of those which are in the tunic. Well
then it was fitting for you to take care how you should be like the
rest of men, just as the thread has no design to be anything superior
to the other threads. But I wish to be purple, that small part which
is bright, and makes all the rest appear graceful and beautiful. Why
then do you tell me to make myself like the many? and if I do, how
shall I still be purple? 

Priscus Helvidius also saw this, and acted conformably. For when Vespasian
sent and commanded him not to go into the senate, he replied, "It
is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, but
so long as I am, I must go in." "Well, go in then," says the emperor,
"but say nothing." "Do not ask my opinion, and I will be silent."
"But I must ask your opinion." "And I must say what I think right."
"But if you do, I shall put you to death." "When then did I tell you
that I am immortal? You will do your part, and I will do mine: it
is your part to kill; it is mine to die, but not in fear: yours to
banish me; mine to depart without sorrow." 

What good then did Priscus do, who was only a single person? And what
good does the purple do for the toga? Why, what else than this, that
it is conspicuous in the toga as purple, and is displayed also as
a fine example to all other things? But in such circumstances another
would have replied to Caesar who forbade him to enter the senate,
"I thank you for sparing me." But such a man Vespasian would not even
have forbidden to enter the senate, for he knew that he would either
sit there like an earthen vessel, or, if he spoke, he would say what
Caesar wished, and add even more. 

In this way an athlete also acted who was in danger of dying unless
his private parts were amputated. His brother came to the athlete,
who was a philosopher, and said, "Come, brother, what are you going
to do? Shall we amputate this member and return to the gymnasium?"
But the athlete persisted in his resolution and died. When some one
asked Epictetus how he did this, as an athlete or a philosopher, "As
a man," Epictetus replied, "and a man who had been proclaimed among
the athletes at the Olympic games and had contended in them, a man
who had been familiar with such a place, and not merely anointed in
Baton's school. Another would have allowed even his head to be cut
off, if he could have lived without it. Such is that regard to character
which is so strong in those who have been accustomed to introduce
it of themselves and conjoined with other things into their deliberations."

"Come, then, Epictetus, shave yourself." "If I am a philosopher,"
I answer, "I will not shave myself." "But I will take off your head?"
If that will do you any good, take it off. 

Some person asked, "How then shall every man among us perceive what
is suitable to his character?" How, he replied, does the bull alone,
when the lion has attacked, discover his own powers and put himself
forward in defense of the whole herd? It is plain that with the powers
the perception of having them is immediately conjoined; and, therefore,
whoever of us has such powers will not be ignorant of them. Now a
bull is not made suddenly, nor a brave man; but we must discipline
ourselves in the winter for the summer campaign, and not rashly run
upon that which does not concern us. 

Only consider at what price you sell your own will; if for no other
reason, at least for this, that you sell it not for a small sum. But
that which is great and superior perhaps belongs to Socrates and such
as are like him. "Why then, if we are naturally such, are not a very
great number of us like him?" Is it true then that all horses become
swift, that all dogs are skilled in tracking footprints? "What, then,
since I am naturally dull, shall I, for this reason, take no pains?"
I hope not. Epictetus is not superior to Socrates; but if he is not
inferior, this is enough for me; for I shall never be a Milo, and
yet I do not neglect my body; nor shall I be a Croesus, and yet I
do not neglect my property; nor, in a word, do we neglect looking
after anything because we despair of reaching the highest degree.

Chapter 3

How a man should proceed from the principle of God being the father
of all men to the rest 

If a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought, that
we are all sprung from God in an especial manner, and that God is
the father both of men and of gods, I suppose that he would never
have any ignoble or mean thoughts about himself. But if Caesar should
adopt you, no one could endure your arrogance; and if you know that
you are the son of Zeus, will you not be elated? Yet we do not so;
but since these two things are mingled in the generation of man, body
in common with the animals, and reason and intelligence in common
with the gods, many incline to this kinship, which is miserable and
mortal; and some few to that which is divine and happy. Since then
it is of necessity that every man uses everything according to the
opinion which he has about it, those, the few, who think that they
are formed for fidelity and modesty and a sure use of appearances
have no mean or ignoble thoughts about themselves; but with the many
it is quite the contrary. For they say, "What am I? A poor, miserable
man, with my wretched bit of flesh." Wretched. Indeed; but you possess
something better than your "bit of flesh." Why then do you neglect
that which is better, and why do you attach yourself to this?

Through this kinship with the flesh, some of us inclining to it become
like wolves, faithless and treacherous and mischievous: some become
like lions, savage and untamed; but the greater part of us become
foxes and other worse animals. For what else is a slanderer and a
malignant man than a fox, or some other more wretched and meaner animal?
See, then, and take care that you do not become some one of these
miserable things. 

Chapter 4

Of progress or improvement 

He who is making progress, having learned from philosophers that desire
means the desire of good things, and aversion means aversion from
bad things; having learned too that happiness and tranquillity are
not attainable by man otherwise than by not failing to obtain what
he desires, and not falling into that which he would avoid; such a
man takes from himself desire altogether and defers it, but he employs
his aversion only on things which are dependent on his will. For if
he attempts to avoid anything independent of his will, he knows that
sometimes he will fall in with something which he wishes to avoid,
and he will be unhappy. Now if virtue promises good fortune and tranquillity
and happiness, certainly also the progress toward virtue is progress
toward each of these things. For it is always true that to whatever
point the perfecting of anything leads us, progress is an approach
toward this point. 

How then do we admit that virtue is such as I have said, and yet seek
progress in other things and make a display of it? What is the product
of virtue? Tranquillity. Who then makes improvement? It is he who
has read many books of Chrysippus? But does virtue consist in having
understood Chrysippus? If this is so, progress is clearly nothing
else than knowing a great deal of Chrysippus. But now we admit that
virtue produces one thing. and we declare that approaching near to
it is another thing, namely, progress or improvement. "Such a person,"
says one, "is already able to read Chrysippus by himself." Indeed,
sir, you are making great progress. What kind of progress? But why
do you mock the man? Why do you draw him away from the perception
of his own misfortunes? Will you not show him the effect of virtue
that he may learn where to look for improvement? Seek it there, wretch,
where your work lies. And where is your work? In desire and in aversion,
that you may not be disappointed in your desire, and that you may
not fall into that which you would avoid; in your pursuit and avoiding,
that you commit no error; in assent and suspension of assent, that
you be not deceived. The first things, and the most necessary, are
those which I have named. But if with trembling and lamentation you
seek not to fall into that which you avoid, tell me how you are improving.

Do you then show me your improvement in these things? If I were talking
to an athlete, I should say, "Show me your shoulders"; and then he
might say, "Here are my halteres." You and your halteres look to that.
I should reply, "I wish to see the effect of the halteres." So, when
you say: "Take the treatise on the active powers, and see how I have
studied it." I reply, "Slave, I am not inquiring about this, but how
you exercise pursuit and avoidance, desire and aversion, how your
design and purpose and prepare yourself, whether conformably to nature
or not. If conformably, give me evidence of it, and I will say that
you are making progress: but if not conformably, be gone, and not
only expound your books, but write such books yourself; and what will
you gain by it? Do you not know that the whole book costs only five
denarii? Does then the expounder seem to be worth more than five denarii?
Never, then, look for the matter itself in one place, and progress
toward it in another." 

Where then is progress? If any of you, withdrawing himself from externals,
turns to his own will to exercise it and to improve it by labour,
so as to make it conformable to nature, elevated, free, unrestrained,
unimpeded, faithful, modest; and if he has learned that he who desires
or avoids the things which are not in his power can neither be faithful
nor free, but of necessity he must change with them and be tossed
about with them as in a tempest, and of necessity must subject himself
to others who have the power to procure or prevent what he desires
or would avoid; finally, when he rises in the morning, if he observes
and keeps these rules, bathes as a man of fidelity, eats as a modest
man; in like manner, if in every matter that occurs he works out his
chief principles as the runner does with reference to running, and
the trainer of the voice with reference to the voice- this is the
man who truly makes progress, and this is the man who has not traveled
in vain. But if he has strained his efforts to the practice of reading
books, and labours only at this, and has traveled for this, I tell
him to return home immediately, and not to neglect his affairs there;
for this for which he has traveled is nothing. But the other thing
is something, to study how a man can rid his life of lamentation and
groaning, and saying, "Woe to me," and "wretched that I am," and to
rid it also of misfortune and disappointment and to learn what death
is, and exile, and prison, and poison, that he may be able to say
when he is in fetters, "Dear Crito, if it is the will of the gods
that it be so, let it be so"; and not to say, "Wretched am I, an old
man; have I kept my gray hairs for this?" Who is it that speaks thus?
Do you think that I shall name some man of no repute and of low condition?
Does not Priam say this? Does not OEdipus say this? Nay, all kings
say it! For what else is tragedy than the perturbations of men who
value externals exhibited in this kind of poetry? But if a man must
learn by fiction that no external things which are independent of
the will concern us, for this? part I should like this fiction, by
the aid of which I should live happily and undisturbed. But you must
consider for yourselves what you wish. 

What then does Chrysippus teach us? The reply is, "to know that these
things are not false, from which happiness comes and tranquillity
arises. Take my books, and you will learn how true and conformable
to nature are the things which make me free from perturbations." O
great good fortune! O the great benefactor who points out the way!
To Triptolemus all men have erected temples and altars, because he
gave us food by cultivation; but to him who discovered truth and brought
it to light and communicated it to all, not the truth which shows
us how to live, but how to live well, who of you for this reason has
built an altar, or a temple, or has dedicated a statue, or who worships
God for this? Because the gods have given the vine, or wheat, we sacrifice
to them: but because they have produced in the human mind that fruit
by which they designed to show us the truth which relates to happiness,
shall we not thank God for this? 

Chapter 5

Against the academics 

If a man, said Epictetus, opposes evident truths, it is not easy to
find arguments by which we shall make him change his opinion. But
this does not arise either from the man's strength or the teacher's
weakness; for when the man, though he has been confuted, is hardened
like a stone, how shall we then be able to deal with him by argument?

Now there are two kinds of hardening, one of the understanding, the
other of the sense of shame, when a man is resolved not to assent
to what is manifest nor to desist from contradictions. Most of us
are afraid of mortification of the body, and would contrive all means
to avoid such a thing, but we care not about the soul's mortification.
And indeed with regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state as
not to apprehend anything, or understand at all, we think that he
is in a bad condition: but if the sense of shame and modesty are deadened,
this we call even power. 

Do you comprehend that you are awake? "I do not," the man replies,
"for I do not even comprehend when in my sleep I imagine that I am
awake." Does this appearance then not differ from the other? "Not
at all," he replies. Shall I still argue with this man? And what fire
or what iron shall I apply to him to make him feel that he is deadened?
He does perceive, but he pretends that he does not. He's even worse
than a dead man. He does not see the contradiction: he is in a bad
condition. Another does see it, but he is not moved, and makes no
improvement: he is even in a worse condition. His modesty is extirpated,
and his sense of shame; and the rational faculty has not been cut
off from him, but it is brutalized. Shall I name this strength of
mind? Certainly not, unless we also name it such in catamites, through
which they do and say in public whatever comes into their head.

Chapter 6

Of providence 

From everything which is or happens in the world, it is easy to praise
Providence, if a man possesses these two qualities, the faculty of
seeing what belongs and happens to all persons and things, and a grateful
disposition. If he does not possess these two qualities, one man will
not see the use of things which are and which happen; another will
not be thankful for them, even if he does know them. If God had made
colours, but had not made the faculty of seeing them, what would have
been their use? None at all. On the other hand, if He had made the
faculty of vision, but had not made objects such as to fall under
the faculty, what in that case also would have been the use of it?
None at all. Well, suppose that He had made both, but had not made
light? In that case, also, they would have been of no use. Who is
it, then, who has fitted this to that and that to this? And who is
it that has fitted the knife to the case and the case to the knife?
Is it no one? And, indeed, from the very structure of things which
have attained their completion, we are accustomed to show that the
work is certainly the act of some artificer, and that it has not been
constructed without a purpose. Does then each of these things demonstrate
the workman, and do not visible things and the faculty of seeing and
light demonstrate Him? And the existence of male and female, and the
desire of each for conjunction, and the power of using the parts which
are constructed, do not even these declare the workman? If they do
not, let us consider the constitution of our understanding according
to which, when we meet with sensible objects, we simply receive impressions
from them, but we also select something from them, and subtract something,
and add, and compound by means of them these things or those, and,
in fact, pass from some to other things which, in a manner, resemble
them: is not even this sufficient to move some men, and to induce
them not to forget the workman? If not so, let them explain to us
what it is that makes each several thing, or how it is possible that
things so wonderful and like the contrivances of art should exist
by chance and from their own proper motion? 

What, then, are these things done in us only. Many, indeed, in us
only, of which the rational animal had peculiar need; but you will
find many common to us with irrational animals. Do they them understand
what is done? By no means. For use is one thing, and understanding
is another: God had need of irrational animals to make use of appearances,
but of us to understand the use of appearances. It is therefore enough
for them to eat and to drink, and to sleep and to copulate, and to
do all the other things which they severally do. But for us, to whom
He has given also the faculty, these things are not sufficient; for
unless we act in a proper and orderly manner, and conformably to the
nature and constitution of each thing, we shall never attain our true
end. For where the constitutions of living beings are different, there
also the acts and the ends are different. In those animals, then,
whose constitution is adapted only to use, use alone is enough: but
in an animal which has also the power of understanding the use, unless
there be the due exercise of the understanding, he will never attain
his proper end. Well then God constitutes every animal, one to be
eaten, another to serve for agriculture, another to supply cheese,
and another for some like use; for which purposes what need is there
to understand appearances and to be able to distinguish them? But
God has introduced man to be a spectator of God and of His works;
and not only a spectator of them, but an interpreter. For this reason
it is shameful for man to begin and to end where irrational animals
do, but rather he ought to begin where they begin, and to end where
nature ends in us; and nature ends in contemplation and understanding,
in a way of life conformable to nature. Take care then not to die
without having been spectators of these things. 

But you take a journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias, and
all of you think it a misfortune to die without having seen such things.
But when there is no need to take a journey, and where a man is, there
he has the works (of God) before him, will you not desire to see and
understand them? Will you not perceive either what you are, or what
you were born for, or what this is for which you have received the
faculty of sight? But you may say, "There are some things disagreeable
and troublesome in life." And are there none in Olympia? Are you not
scorched? Are you not pressed by a crowd? Are you not without comfortable
means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance
of noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that
setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle,
you bear and endure. Well, then, and have you not received faculties
by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received
greatness of soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received
endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen
if I possess greatness of soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb
me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes
for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?

"Yes, but my nose runs." For what purpose then, slave, have you hands?
Is it not that you may wipe your nose? "Is it, then, consistent with
reason that there should be running of noses in the world?" Nay, how
much better it is to wipe your nose than to find fault. What do you
think that Hercules would have been if there had not been such a lion,
and hydra, and stag, and boar, and certain unjust and bestial men,
whom Hercules used to drive away and clear out? And what would he
have been doing if there had been nothing of the kind? Is it not plain
that he would have wrapped himself up and have slept? In the first
place, then he would not have been a Hercules, when he was dreaming
away all his life in such luxury and case; and even if he had been
one what would have been the use of him? and what the use of his arms,
and of the strength of the other parts of his body, and his endurance
and noble spirit, if such circumstances and occasions had not roused
and exercised him? "Well, then, must a man provide for himself such
means of exercise, and to introduce a lion from some place into his
country, and a boar and a hydra?" This would be folly and madness:
but as they did exist, and were found, they were useful for showing
what Hercules was and for exercising him. Come then do you also having
observed these things look to the faculties which you have, and when
you have looked at them, say: "Bring now, O Zeus, any difficulty that
Thou pleasest, for I have means given to me by Thee and powers for
honoring myself through the things which happen." You do not so; but
you sit still, trembling for fear that some things will happen, and
weeping, and lamenting and groaning for what does happen: and then
you blame the gods. For what is the consequence of such meanness of
spirit but impiety? And yet God has not only given us these faculties;
by which we shall be able to bear everything that happens without
being depressed or broken by it; but, like a good king and a true
father, He has given us these faculties free from hindrance, subject
to no compulsion unimpeded, and has put them entirely in our own power,
without even having reserved to Himself any power of hindering or
impeding. You, who have received these powers free and as your own,
use them not: you do not even see what you have received, and from
whom; some of you being blinded to the giver, and not even acknowledging
your benefactor, and others, through meanness of spirit, betaking
yourselves to fault finding and making charges against God. Yet I
will show to you that you have powers and means for greatness of soul
and manliness but what powers you have for finding fault and making
accusations, do you show me. 

Chapter 7

Of the use of sophistical arguments, and hypothetical, and the like

The handling of sophistical and hypothetical arguments, and of those
which derive their conclusions from questioning, and in a word the
handling of all such arguments, relates to the duties of life, though
the many do not know this truth. For in every matter we inquire how
the wise and good man shall discover the proper path and the proper
method of dealing with the matter. Let, then, people either say that
the grave man will not descend into the contest of question and answer,
or that, if he does descend into the contest, he will take no care
about not conducting himself rashly or carelessly in questioning and
answering. But if they do not allow either the one or the other of
these things, they must admit that some inquiry ought to be made into
those topics on which particularly questioning and answering are employed.
For what is the end proposed in reasoning? To establish true propositions,
to remove the false, to withhold assent from those which are not plain.
Is it enough then to have learned only this? "It is enough," a man
may reply. Is it, then, also enough for a man, who would not make
a mistake in the use of coined money, to have heard this precept,
that he should receive the genuine drachmae and reject the spurious?
"It is not enough." What, then, ought to be added to this precept?
What else than the faculty which proves and distinguishes the genuine
and the spurious drachmae? Consequently also in reasoning what has
been said is not enough; but is it necessary that a man should acquire
the faculty of examining and distinguishing the true and the false,
and that which is not plain? "It is necessary." Besides this, what
is proposed in reasoning? "That you should accept what follows from
that which you have properly granted." Well, is it then enough in
this case also to know this? It is not enough; but a man must learn
how one thing is a consequence of other things, and when one thing
follows from one thing, and when it follows from several collectively.
Consider, then if it be not necessary that this power should also
be acquired by him who purposes to conduct himself skillfully in reasoning,
the power of demonstrating himself the several things which he has
proposed, and the power of understanding the demonstrations of others,
including of not being deceived by sophists, as if they were demonstrating.
Therefore there has arisen among us the practice and exercise of conclusive
arguments and figures, and it has been shown to be necessary.

But in fact in some cases we have properly granted the premisses or
assumptions, and there results from them something; and though it
is not true, yet none the less it does result. What then ought I to
do? Ought I to admit the falsehood? And how is that possible? Well,
should I say that I did not properly grant that which we agreed upon?
"But you are not allowed to do even this." Shall I then say that the
consequence does not arise through what has been conceded? "But neither
is it allowed." What then must be done in this case? Consider if it
is not this: as to have borrowed is not enough to make a man still
a debtor, but to this must be added the fact that he continues to
owe the money and that the debt is not paid, so it is not enough to
compel you to admit the inference that you have granted the premisses,
but you must abide by what you have granted. Indeed, if the premisses
continue to the end such as they were when they were granted, it is
absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have granted, and
we must accept their consequences: but if the premisses do not remain
such as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessary
for us also to withdraw from what we granted, and from accepting what
does not follow from the words in which our concessions were made.
For the inference is now not our inference, nor does it result with
our assent, since we have withdrawn from the premisses which we granted.
We ought then both to examine such kind of premisses, and such change
and variation of them, by which in the course of questioning or answering,
or in making the syllogistic conclusion, or in any other such way,
the premisses undergo variations, and give occasion to the foolish
to be confounded, if they do not see what conclusions are. For what
reason ought we to examine? In order that we may not in this matter
be employed in an improper manner nor in a confused way.

And the same in hypotheses and hypothetical arguments; for it is necessary
sometimes to demand the granting of some hypothesis as a kind of passage
to the argument which follows. Must we then allow every hypothesis
that is proposed, or not allow every one? And if not every one, which
should we allow? And if a man has allowed an hypothesis, must he in
every case abide by allowing it? or must he sometimes withdraw from
it, but admit the consequences and not admit contradictions? Yes;
but suppose that a man says, "If you admit the hypothesis of a possibility,
I will draw you to an impossibility." With such a person shall a man
of sense refuse to enter into a contest, and avoid discussion and
conversation with him? But what other man than the man of sense can
use argumentation and is skillful in questioning and answering, and
incapable of being cheated and deceived by false reasoning? And shall
he enter into the contest, and yet not take care whether he shall
engage in argument not rashly and not carelessly? And if he does not
take care, how can he be such a man as we conceive him to be? But
without some such exercise and preparation, can he maintain a continuous
and consistent argument? Let them show this; and all these speculations
become superfluous, and are absurd and inconsistent with our notion
of a good and serious man. 

Why are we still indolent and negligent and sluggish, and why do we
seek pretences for not labouring and not being watchful in cultivating
our reason? "If then I shall make a mistake in these matters may I
not have killed my father?" Slave, where was there a father in this
matter that you could kill him? What, then, have you done? The only
fault that was possible here is the fault which you have committed.
This is the very remark which I made to Rufus when he blamed me for
not having discovered the one thing omitted in a certain syllogism:
"I suppose," I said, "that I have burnt the Capitol." "Slave," he
replied, "was the thing omitted here the Capitol?" Or are these the
only crimes, to burn the Capitol and to kill your father? But for
a man to use the appearances resented to him rashly and foolishly
and carelessly, not to understand argument, nor demonstration, nor
sophism, nor, in a word, to see in questioning and answering what
is consistent with that which we have granted or is not consistent;
is there no error in this? 

Chapter 8

That the faculties are not safe to the uninstructed 

In as many ways as we can change things which are equivalent to one
another, in just so many ways we can change the forms of arguments
and enthymemes in argumentation. This is an instance: "If you have
borrowed and not repaid, you owe me the money: you have not borrowed
and you have not repaid; then you do not owe me the money." To do
this skillfully is suitable to no man more than to the philosopher;
for if the enthymeme is all imperfect syllogism. it is plain that
he who has been exercised in the perfect syllogism must be equally
expert in the imperfect also. 

"Why then do we not exercise ourselves and one another in this manner?"
Because, I reply, at present, though we are not exercised in these
things and not distracted from the study of morality, by me at least,
still we make no progress in virtue. What then must we expect if we
should add this occupation? and particularly as this would not only
be an occupation which would withdraw us from more necessary things,
but would also be a cause of self conceit and arrogance, and no small
cause. For great is the power of arguing and the faculty of persuasion,
and particularly if it should be much exercised, and also receive
additional ornament from language: and so universally, every faculty
acquired by the uninstructed and weak brings with it the danger of
these persons being elated and inflated by it. For by what means could
one persuade a young man who excels in these matters that he ought
not to become an appendage to them, but to make them an appendage
to himself? Does he not trample on all such reasons, and strut before
us elated and inflated, not enduring that any man should reprove him
and remind him of what he has neglected and to what he has turned
aside? 

"What, then, was not Plato a philosopher?" I reply, "And was not Hippocrates
a physician? but you see how Hippocrates speaks." Does Hippocrates,
then, speak thus in respect of being a physician? Why do you mingle
things which have been accidentally united in the same men? And if
Plato was handsome and strong, ought I also to set to work and endeavor
to become handsome or strong, as if this was necessary for philosophy,
because a certain philosopher was at the same time handsome and a
philosopher? Will you not choose to see and to distinguish in respect
to what men become philosophers, and what things belong to belong
to them in other respects? And if I were a philosopher, ought you
also to be made lame? What then? Do I take away these faculties which
you possess? By no means; for neither do I take away the faculty of
seeing. But if you ask me what is the good of man, I cannot mention
to you anything else than that it is a certain disposition of the
will with respect to appearances. 

Chapter 9

How from the fact that we are akin to God a man may proceed to the
consequences 

If the things are true which are said by the philosophers about the
kinship between God and man, what else remains for men to do then
what Socrates did? Never in reply to the question, to what country
you belong, say that you are an Athenian or a Corinthian, but that
you are a citizen of the world. For why do you say that you are an
Athenian, and why do you not say that you belong to the small nook
only into which your poor body was cast at birth? Is it not plain
that you call yourself an Athenian or Corinthian from the place which
has a greater authority and comprises not only that small nook itself
and all your family, but even the whole country from which the stock
of your progenitors is derived down to you? He then who has observed
with intelligence the administration of the world, and has learned
that the greatest and supreme and the most comprehensive community
is that which is composed of men and God, and that from God have descended
the seeds not only to my father and grandfather, but to all beings
which are generated on the earth and are produced, and particularly
to rational beings- for these only are by their nature formed to have
communion with God, being by means of reason conjoined with Him- why
should not such a man call himself a citizen of the world, why not
a son of God, and why should he be afraid of anything which happens
among men? Is kinship with Caesar or with any other of the powerful
in Rome sufficient to enable us to live in safety, and above contempt
and without any fear at all? and to have God for your maker and father
and guardian, shall not this release us from sorrows and fears?

But a man may say, "Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?"

And how do slaves, and runaways, on what do they rely when they leave
their masters? Do they rely on their lands or slaves, or their vessels
of silver? They rely on nothing but themselves, and food does not
fail them. And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher
to travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and
not to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational
animals and more cowardly, each of which, being self-sufficient, neither
fails to get its proper food, nor to find a suitable way of living,
and one conformable to nature? 

I indeed think that the old man ought to be sitting here, not to contrive
how you may have no mean thoughts nor mean and ignoble talk about
yourselves, but to take care that there be not among us any young
men of such a mind that, when they have recognized their kinship to
God, and that we are fettered by these bonds, the body, I mean, and
its possessions, and whatever else on account of them is necessary
to us for the economy and commerce of life, they should intend to
throw off these things as if they were burdens painful and intolerable,
and to depart to their kinsmen. But this is the labour that your teacher
and instructor ought to be employed upon, if he really were what he
should be. You should come to him and say, "Epictetus, we can no longer
endure being bound to this poor body, and feeding it and giving it
drink, and rest, and cleaning it, and for the sake of the body complying
with the wishes of these and of those. Are not these things indifferent
and nothing to us, and is not death no evil? And are we not in a manner
kinsmen of God, and did we not come from Him? Allow us to depart to
the place from which we came; allow us to be released at last from
these bonds by which we are bound and weighed down. Here there are
robbers and thieves and courts of justice, and those who are named
tyrants, and think that they have some power over us by means of the
body and its possessions. Permit us to show them that they have no
power over any man." And I on my part would say, "Friends, wait for
God; when He shall give the signal and release you from this service,
then go to Him; but for the present endure to dwell in this place
where He has put you: short indeed is this time of your dwelling here,
and easy to bear for those who are so disposed: for what tyrant or
what thief, or what courts of justice, are formidable to those who
have thus considered as things of no value the body and the possessions
of the body? Wait then, do not depart without a reason."

Something like this ought to be said by the teacher to ingenuous youths.
But now what happens? The teacher is a lifeless body, and you are
lifeless bodies. When you have been well filled to-day, you sit down
and lament about the morrow, how you shall get something to eat. Wretch,
if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart
from life. The door is open. Why do you grieve? where does there remain
any room for tears? and where is there occasion for flattery? why
shall one man envy another? why should a man admire the rich or the
powerful, even if they be both very strong and of violent temper?
for what will they do to us? We shall not care for that which they
can do; and what we do care for, that they cannot do. How did Socrates
behave with respect to these matters? Why, in what other way than
a man ought to do who was convinced that he was a kinsman of the gods?
"If you say to me now," said Socrates to his judges, "'We will acquit
you on the condition that you no longer discourse in the way in which
you have hitherto discoursed, nor trouble either our young or our
old men,' I shall answer, 'you make yourselves ridiculous by thinking
that, if one of our commanders has appointed me to a certain post,
it is my duty to keep and maintain it, and to resolve to die a thousand
times rather than desert it; but if God has put us in any place and
way of life, we ought to desert it.'" Socrates speaks like a man who
is really a kinsman of the gods. But we think about ourselves as if
we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear,
we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters,
and we fear them also. 

A man asked me to write to Rome about him, a man who, as most people
thought, had been unfortunate, for formerly he was a man of rank and
rich, but had been stripped of all, and was living here. I wrote on
his behalf in a submissive manner; but when he had read the letter,
he gave it back to me and said, "I wished for your help, not your
pity: no evil has happened to me." 

Thus also Musonius Rufus, in order to try me, used to say: "This and
this will befall you from your master"; and I replied that these were
things which happen in the ordinary course of human affairs. "Why,
then," said he, "should I ask him for anything when I can obtain it
from you?" For, in fact, what a man has from himself, it is superfluous
and foolish to receive from another? Shall I, then, who am able to
receive from myself greatness of soul and a generous spirit, receive
from you land and money or a magisterial office? I hope not: I will
not be so ignorant about my own possessions. But when a man is cowardly
and mean, what else must be done for him than to write letters as
you would about a corpse. "Please to grant us the body of a certain
person and a sextarius of poor blood." For such a person is, in fact,
a carcass and a sextarius of blood, and nothing more. But if he were
anything more, he would know that one man is not miserable through
the means of another. 

Chapter 10

Against those who eagerly seek preferment at Rome 

If we applied ourselves as busily to our own work as the old men at
Rome do to those matters about which they are employed, perhaps we
also might accomplish something. I am acquainted with a man older
than myself who is now superintendent of corn at Rome, and remember
the time when he came here on his way back from exile, and what he
said as he related the events of his former life, and how he declared
that with respect to the future after his return he would look after
nothing else than passing the rest of his life in quiet and tranquillity.
"For how little of life," he said, remains for me." I replied, "You
will not do it, but as soon as you smell Rome, you will forget all
that you have said; and if admission is allowed even into the imperial
palace, you will gladly thrust yourself in and thank God." "If you
find me, Epictetus," he answered, "setting even one foot within the
palace, think what you please." Well, what then did he do? Before
he entered the city he was met by letters from Caesar, and as soon
as he received them he forgot all, and ever after has added one piece
of business to another. I wish that I were now by his side to remind
him of what he said when he was passing this way and to tell him how
much better a seer I am than he is. 

Well, then, do I say that man is an animal made for doing nothing?
Certainly not. But why are we not active? For example, as to myself,
as soon as day comes, in a few words I remind myself of what I must
read over to my pupils; then forthwith I say to myself, "But what
is it to me how a certain person shall read? the first thing for me
is to sleep." And indeed what resemblance is there between what other
persons do and what we do? If you observe what they do, you will understand.
And what else do they do all day long than make up accounts, inquire
among themselves, give and take advice about some small quantity of
grain, a bit of land, and such kind of profits? Is it then the same
thing to receive a petition and to read in it: "I entreat you to permit
me to export a small quantity of corn"; and one to this effect: "I
entreat you to learn from Chrysippus what is the administration of
the world, and what place in it the rational animal holds; consider
also who you are, and what is the nature of your good and bad." Are
these things like the other, do they require equal care, and is it
equally base to neglect these and those? Well, then, are we the only
persons who are lazy and love sleep? No; but much rather you young
men are. For we old men, when we see young men amusing themselves,
are eager to play with them; and if I saw you active and zealous,
much more should I be eager myself to join you in your serious pursuits.

Chapter 11

Of natural affection 

When he was visited by one of the magistrates, Epictetus inquired
of him about several particulars, and asked if he had children and
a wife. The man replied that he had; and Epictetus inquired further,
how he felt under the circumstances. "Miserable," the man said. Then
Epictetus asked, "In what respect," for men do not marry and beget
children in order to be wretched, but rather to be happy. "But I,"
the man replied, "am so wretched about my children that lately, when
my little daughter was sick and was supposed to be in danger, I could
not endure to stay with her, but I left home till a person sent me
news that she had recovered." Well then, said Epictetus, do you think
that you acted right? "I acted naturally," the man replied. But convince
me of this that you acted naturally, and I will convince you that
everything which takes place according to nature takes place rightly.
"This is the case," said the man, "with all or at least most fathers."
I do not deny that: but the matter about which we are inquiring is
whether such behavior is right; for in respect to this matter we must
say that tumours also come for the good of the body, because they
do come; and generally we must say that to do wrong is natural, because
nearly all or at least most of us do wrong. Do you show me then how
your behavior is natural. "I cannot," he said; "but do you rather
show me how it is not according to nature and is not rightly done.

Well, said Epictetus, if we were inquiring about white and black,
what criterion should we employ for distinguishing between them? "The
sight," he said. And if about hot and cold, and hard and soft, what
criterion? "The touch." Well then, since we are inquiring about things
which are according to nature, and those which are done rightly or
not rightly, what kind of criterion do you think that we should employ?
"I do not know," he said. And yet not to know the criterion of colors
and smells, and also of tastes, is perhaps no great harm; but if a
man do not know the criterion of good and bad, and of things according
to nature and contrary to nature, does this seem to you a small harm?
"The greatest harm." Come tell me, do all things which seem to some
persons to be good and becoming rightly appear such; and at present
as to Jews and Syrians and Egyptians and Romans, is it possible that
the opinions of all of them in respect to food are right? "How is
it possible?" he said. Well, I suppose it is absolutely necessary
that, if the opinions of the Egyptians are right, the opinions of
the rest must be wrong: if the opinions of the Jews are right, those
of the rest cannot be right. "Certainly." But where there is ignorance,
there also there is want of learning and training in things which
are necessary. He assented to this. You then, said Epictetus, since
you know this, for the future will employ yourself seriously about
nothing else, and will apply your mind to nothing else than to learn
the criterion of things which are according to nature, and by using
it also to determine each several thing. But in the present matter
I have so much as this to aid you toward what you wish. Does affection
to those of your family appear to you to be according to nature and
to be good? "Certainly." Well, is such affection natural and good,
and is a thing consistent with reason not good? "By no means." Is
then that which is consistent with reason in contradiction with affection?
"I think not." You are right, for if it is otherwise, it is necessary
that one of the contradictions being according to nature, the other
must be contrary to nature. Is it not so? "It is," he said. Whatever,
then, we shall discover to be at the same time affectionate and also
consistent with reason, this we confidently declare to be right and
good. "Agreed." Well then to leave your sick child and to go away
is not reasonable, and I suppose that you will not say that it is;
but it remains for us to inquire if it is consistent with affection.
"Yes, let us consider." Did you, then, since you had an affectionate
disposition to your child, do right when you ran off and left her;
and has the mother no affection for the child? "Certainly, she has."
Ought, then, the mother also to have left her, or ought she not? "She
ought not." And the nurse, does she love her? "She does." Ought, then,
she also to have left her? "By no means." And the pedagogue, does
he not love her? "He does love her." Ought, then, he also to have
deserted her? and so should the child have been left alone and without
help on account of the great affection of you, the parents, and of
those about her, or should she have died in the hands of those who
neither loved her nor cared for her? "Certainly not." Now this is
unfair and unreasonable, not to allow those who have equal affection
with yourself to do what you think to be proper for yourself to do
because you have affection. It is absurd. Come then, if you were sick,
would you wish your relations to be so affectionate, and all the rest,
children and wife, as to leave you alone and deserted? "By no means."
And would you wish to be so loved by your own that through their excessive
affection you would always be left alone in sickness? or for this
reason would you rather pray, if it were possible, to be loved by
your enemies and deserted by them? But if this is so, it results that
your behavior was not at all an affectionate act. 

Well then, was it nothing which moved you and induced you to desert
your child? and how is that possible? But it might be something of
the kind which moved a man at Rome to wrap up his head while a horse
was running which he favoured; and when contrary to expectation the
horse won, he required sponges to recover from his fainting fit. What
then is the thing which moved? The exact discussion of this does not
belong to the present occasion perhaps; but it is enough to be convinced
of this, if what the philosophers say is true, that we must not look
for it anywhere without, but in all cases it is one and the same thing
which is the cause of our doing or not doing something, of saying
or not saying something, of being elated or depressed, of avoiding
anything or pursuing: the very thing which is now the cause to me
and to you, to you of coming to me and sitting and hearing, and to
me of saying what I do say. And what is this? Is it any other than
our will to do so? "No other." But if we had willed otherwise, what
else should we have been doing than that which we willed to do? This,
then, was the cause of Achilles' lamentation, not the death of Patroclus;
for another man does not behave thus on the death of his companion;
but it was because he chose to do so. And to you this was the very
cause of your then running away, that you chose to do so; and on the
other side, if you should stay with her, the reason will be the same.
And now you are going to Rome because you choose; and if you should
change your mind, you will not go thither. And in a word, neither
death nor exile nor pain nor anything of the kind is the cause of
our doing anything or not doing; but our own opinions and our wills.

Do I convince you of this or not? "You do convince me." Such, then,
as the causes are in each case, such also are the effects. When, then,
we are doing anything not rightly, from this day we shall impute it
to nothing else than to the will from which we have done it: and it
is that which we shall endeavour to take away and to extirpate more
than the tumours and abscesses out of the body. And in like manner
we shall give the same account of the cause of the things which we
do right; and we shall no longer allege as causes of any evil to us,
either slave or neighbour, or wife or children, being persuaded that,
if we do not think things to he what we do think them to be, we do
not the acts which follow from such opinions; and as to thinking or
not thinking, that is in our power and not in externals. "It is so,"
he said. From this day then we shall inquire into and examine nothing
else, what its quality is, or its state, neither land nor slaves nor
horses nor dogs, nothing else than opinions. "I hope so." You see,
then, that you must become a Scholasticus, an animal whom all ridicule,
if you really intend to make an examination of your own opinions:
and that this is not the work of one hour or day, you know yourself.

Chapter 12

Of contentment 

With respect to gods, there are some who say that a divine being does
not exist: others say that it exists, but is inactive and careless,
and takes no forethought about anything; a third class say that such
a being exists and exercises forethought, but only about great things
and heavenly things, and about nothing on the earth; a fourth class
say that a divine being exercises forethought both about things on
the earth and heavenly things, but in a general way only, and not
about things severally. There is a fifth class to whom Ulysses and
Socrates belong, who say: "I move not without thy knowledge."

Before all other things, then, it is necessary to inquire about each
of these opinions, whether it is affirmed truly or not truly. For
if there are no gods, how is it our proper end to follow them? And
if they exist, but take no care of anything, in this case also how
will it be right to follow them? But if indeed they do exist and look
after things, still if there is nothing communicated from them to
men, nor in fact to myself, how even so is it right? The wise and
good man, then, after considering all these things, submits his own
mind to him who administers the whole, as good citizens do to the
law of the state. He who is receiving instruction ought to come to
the instructed with this intention: How shall I follow the gods in
all things, how shall I be contented with the divine administration,
and how can I become free?" For he is free to whom everything happens
according, to his will, and whom no man can hinder. "What then, is
freedom madness?" Certainly not: for madness and freedom do not consist.
"But," you say, "I would have everything result just as I like, and
in whatever way I like." You are mad, you are beside yourself. Do
you not know that freedom is a noble and valuable thing? But for me
inconsiderately to wish for things to happen as I inconsiderately
like, this appears to be not only not noble, but even most base. For
how do we proceed in the matter of writing? Do I wish to write the
name of Dion as I choose? No, but I am taught to choose to write it
as it ought to be written. And how with respect to music? In the same
manner. And what universally in every art or science? Just the same.
If it were not so, it would be of no value to know anything, if knowledge
were adapted to every man's whim. Is it, then, in this alone, in this
which is the greatest and the chief thing, I mean freedom, that I
am permitted to will inconsiderately? By no means; but to be instructed
is this, to learn to wish that everything may happen as it does. And
how do things happen? As the disposer has disposed them? And he has
appointed summer and winter, and abundance and scarcity, and virtue
and vice, and all such opposites for the harmony of the whole; and
to each of us he has given a body, and parts of the body, and possessions,
and companions. 

Remembering, then, this disposition of things we ought to go to be
instructed, not that we may change the constitution of things- for
we have not the power to do it, nor is it better that we should have
the power-but in order that, as the things around us are what they
are and by nature exist, we may maintain our minds in harmony with
them things which happen. For can we escape from men? and how is it
possible? And if we associate with them, can we chance them? Who gives
us the power? What then remains, or what method is discovered of holding
commerce with them? Is there such a method by which they shall do
what seems fit to them, and we not the less shall be in a mood which
is conformable to nature? But you are unwilling to endure and are
discontented: and if you are alone, you call it solitude; and of you
are with men, you call them knaves and robbers; and you find fault
with your own parents and children, and brothers and neighbours. But
you ought when you are alone to call this condition by the name of
tranquillity and freedom, and to think yourself like to the gods;
and when you are with many, you ought not to call it crowd, nor trouble,
nor uneasiness, but festival and assembly, and so accept all contentedly.

What, then, is the punishment of those who do not accept? It is to
be what they are. Is any person dissatisfied with being alone, let
him be alone. Is a man dissatisfied with his parents? let him be a
bad son, and lament. Is he dissatisfied with his children? let him
be a bad father. "Cast him into prison." What prison? Where he is
already, for he is there against his will; and where a man is against
his will, there he is in prison. So Socrates was not in prison, for
he was there willingly. "Must my leg then be lamed?" Wretch, do you
then on account of one poor leg find fault with the world? Will you
not willingly surrender it for the whole? Will you not withdraw from
it? Will you not gladly part with it to him who gave it? And will
you be vexed and discontented with the things established by Zeus,
which he with the Moirae who were present and spinning the thread
of your generation, defined and put in order? Know you not how small
a part you are compared with the whole. I mean with respect to the
body, for as to intelligence you are not inferior to the gods nor
less; for the magnitude of intelligence is not measured by length
nor yet by height, but by thoughts. 

Will you not, then, choose to place your good in that in which you
are equal to the gods? "Wretch that I am to have such a father and
mother." What, then, was it permitted to you to come forth, and to
select, and to say: "Let such a man at this moment unite with such
a woman that I may be produced?" It was not permitted, but it was
a necessity for your parents to exist first, and then for you to be
begotten. Of what kind of parents? Of such as they were. Well then,
since they are such as they are, is there no remedy given to you?
Now if you did not know for what purpose you possess the faculty of
vision, you would be unfortunate and wretched if you closed your eyes
when colors were brought before them; but in that you possess greatness
of soul and nobility of spirit for every event that may happen, and
you know not that you possess them, are you not more unfortunate and
wretched? Things are brought close to you which are proportionate
to the power which you possess, but you turn away this power most
particularly at the very time when you ought to maintain it open and
discerning. Do you not rather thank the gods that they have allowed
you to be above these things which they have not placed in your power;
and have made you accountable only for those which are in your power?
As to your parents, the gods have left you free from responsibility;
and so with respect to your brothers, and your body, and possessions,
and death and life. For what, then, have they made you responsible?
For that which alone is in your power, the proper use of appearances.
Why then do you draw on yourself the things for which you are not
responsible? It is, indeed, a giving of trouble to yourself.

Chapter 13

How everything may he done acceptably to the gods 

When some one asked, how may a man eat acceptably to the gods, he
answered: If he can eat justly and contentedly, and with equanimity,
and temperately and orderly, will it not be also acceptably to the
gods? But when you have asked for warm water and the slave has not
heard, or if he did hear has brought only tepid water, or he is not
even found to be in the house, then not to be vexed or to burst with
passion, is not this acceptable to the gods? "How then shall a man
endure such persons as this slave?" Slave yourself, will you not bear
with your own brother, who has Zeus for his progenitor, and is like
a son from the same seeds and of the same descent from above? But
if you have been put in any such higher place, will you immediately
make yourself a tyrant? Will you not remember who you are, and whom
you rule? that they are kinsmen, that they are brethren by nature,
that they are the offspring of Zeus? "But I have purchased them, and
they have not purchased me." Do you see in what direction you are
looking, that it is toward the earth, toward the pit, that it is toward
these wretched laws of dead men? but toward the laws of the gods you
are not looking. 

Chapter 14

That the deity oversees all things 

When a person asked him how a man could be convinced that all his
actions are under the inspection of God, he answered, Do you not think
that all things are united in one? "I do," the person replied. Well,
do you not think that earthly things have a natural agreement and
union with heavenly things "I do." And how else so regularly as if
by God's command, when He bids the plants to flower, do they flower?
when He bids them to send forth shoots, do they shoot? when He bids
them to produce fruit, how else do they produce fruit? when He bids
the fruit to ripen, does it ripen? when again He bids them to cast
down the fruits, how else do they cast them down? and when to shed
the leaves, do they shed the leaves? and when He bids them to fold
themselves up and to remain quiet and rest, how else do they remain
quiet and rest? And how else at the growth and the wane of the moon,
and at the approach and recession of the sun, are so great an alteration
and change to the contrary seen in earthly things? But are plants
and our bodies so bound up and united with the whole, and are not
our souls much more? and our souls so bound up and in contact with
God as parts of Him and portions of Him; and does not God perceive
every motion of these parts as being His own motion connate with Himself?
Now are you able to think of the divine administration, and about
all things divine, and at the same time also about human affairs,
and to be moved by ten thousand things at the same time in your senses
and in your understanding, and to assent to some, and to dissent from
others, and again as to some things to suspend your judgment; and
do you retain in your soul so many impressions from so many and various
things, and being moved by them, do you fall upon notions similar
to those first impressed, and do you retain numerous arts and the
memories of ten thousand things; and is not God able to oversee all
things, and to be present with all, and to receive from all a certain
communication? And is the sun able to illuminate so large a part of
the All, and to leave so little not illuminated, that part only which
is occupied by the earth's shadow; and He who made the sun itself
and makes it go round, being a small part of Himself compared with
the whole, cannot He perceive all things? 

"But I cannot," the man may reply, "comprehend all these things at
once." But who tells you that you have equal power with Zeus? Nevertheless
he has placed by every man a guardian, every man's Demon, to whom
he has committed the care of the man, a guardian who never sleeps,
is never deceived. For to what better and more careful guardian could
He have entrusted each of us? When, then, you have shut the doors
and made darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone,
for you are not; but God is within, and your Demon is within, and
what need have they of light to see what you are doing? To this God
you ought to swear an oath just as the soldiers do to Caesar. But
they who are hired for pay swear to regard the safety of Caesar before
all things; and you who have received so many and such great favours,
will you not swear, or when you have sworn, will you not abide by
your oath? And what shall you swear? Never to be disobedient, never
to make any charges, never to find fault with anything that he has
given, and never unwillingly to do or to suffer anything, that is
necessary. Is this oath like the soldier's oath? The soldiers swear
not to prefer any man to Caesar: in this oath men swear to honour
themselves before all. 

Chapter 15

What philosophy promises 

When a man was consulting him how he should persuade his brother to
cease being angry with him, Epictetus replied: Philosophy does not
propose to secure for a man any external thing. If it did philosophy
would be allowing something which is not within its province. For
as the carpenter's material is wood, and that of the statuary is copper,
so the matter of the art of living is each man's life. "What then
is my brother's?" That again belongs to his own art; but with respect
to yours, it is one of the external things, like a piece of land,
like health, like reputation. But Philosophy promises none of these.
"In every circumstance I will maintain," she says, "the governing
part conformable to nature." Whose governing part? "His in whom I
am," she says. 

"How then shall my brother cease to be angry with me?" Bring him to
me and I will tell him. But I have nothing to say to you about his
anger. 

When the man, who was consulting him, said, "I seek to know this-
how, even if my brother is not reconciled to me, shall I maintain
myself in a state conformable to nature?" Nothing great, said Epictetus,
is produced suddenly, since not even the grape or the fig is. If you
say to me now that you want a fig, I will answer to you that it requires
time: let it flower first, then put forth fruit, and then ripen. Is,
then, the fruit of a fig-tree not perfected suddenly and in one hour,
and would you possess the fruit of a man's mind in so short a time
and so easily? Do not expect it, even if I tell you. 

Chapter 16

Of providence 

Do not wonder if for other animals than man all things are provided
for the body, not only food and drink, but beds also, and they have
no need of shoes nor bed materials, nor clothing; but we require all
these additional things. For, animals not being made for themselves,
but for service, it was not fit for them to he made so as to need
other things. For consider what it would be for us to take care not
only of ourselves, but also about cattle and asses, how they should
be clothed, and how shod, and how they should eat and drink. Now as
soldiers are ready for their commander, shod, clothed and armed: but
it would be a hard thing, for the chiliarch to go round and shoe or
clothe his thousand men; so also nature has formed the animals which
are made for service, all ready, prepared, and requiring no further
care. So one little boy with only a stick drives the cattle.

But now we, instead of being thankful that we need not take the same
care of animals as of ourselves, complain of God on our own account;
and yet, in the name of Zeus and the gods, any one thing of those
which exist would be enough to make a man perceive the providence
of God, at least a man who is modest and grateful. And speak not to
me now of the great thins, but only of this, that milk is produced
from grass, and cheese from milk, and wool from skins. Who made these
things or devised them? "No one," you say. Oh, amazing shamelessness
and stupidity! 

Well, let us omit the works of nature and contemplate her smaller
acts. Is there anything less useful than the hair on the chin? What
then, has not nature used this hair also in the most suitable manner
possible? Has she not by it distinguished the male and the female?
does not the nature of every man forthwith proclaim from a distance,
"I am a man; as such approach me, as such speak to me; look for nothing
else; see the signs"? Again, in the case of women, as she has mingled
something softer in the voice, so she has also deprived them of hair
(on the chin). You say: "Not so; the human animal ought to have been
left without marks of distinction, and each of us should have been
obliged to proclaim, 'I am a man.' But how is not the sign beautiful
and becoming, and venerable? how much more beautiful than the cock's
comb, how much more becoming than the lion's mane? For this reason
we ought to preserve the signs which God has given, we ought not to
throw them away, nor to confound, as much as we can, the distinctions
of the sexes. 

Are these the only works of providence in us? And what words are sufficient
to praise them and set them forth according to their worth? For if
we had understanding, ought we to do anything else both jointly and
severally than to sing hymns and bless the deity, and to tell of his
benefits? Ought we not when we are digging and ploughing and eating
to sing this hymn to God? "Great is God, who has given us such implements
with which we shall cultivate the earth: great is God who has given
us hands, the power of swallowing, a stomach, imperceptible growth,
and the power of breathing while we sleep." This is what we ought
to sing on every occasion, and to sing the greatest and most divine
hymn for giving us the faculty of comprehending these things and using
a proper way. Well then, since most of you have become blind, ought
there not to be some man to fill this office, and on behalf of all
to sing the hymn to God? For what else can I do, a lame old man, than
sing hymns to God? If then I was a nightingale, I would do the part
of a nightingale: if I were a swan, I would do like a swan. But now
I am a rational creature, and I ought to praise God: this is my work;
I do it, nor will I desert this post, so long as I am allowed to keep
it; and I exhort you to join in this same song. 

Chapter 17

That the logical art is necessary 

Since reason is the faculty which analyses and perfects the rest,
and it ought itself not to be unanalysed, by what should it be analysed?
for it is plain that this should be done either by itself or by another
thing. Either, then, this other thing also is reason, or something
else superior to reason; which is impossible. But if it is reason,
again who shall analyse that reason? For if that reason does this
for itself, our reason also can do it. But we shall require something
else, the thing, will go on to infinity and have no end. Reason therefore
is analysed by itself. "Yes: but it is more urgent to cure (our opinions)
and the like." Will you then hear about those things? Hear. But if
you should say, "I know not whether you are arguing truly or falsely,"
and if I should express myself in any way ambiguously, and you should
say to me, " Distinguish," I will bear with you no longer, and I shall
say to "It is more urgent." This is the reason, I suppose, why they
place the logical art first, as in the measuring of corn we place
first the examination of the measure. But if we do not determine first
what is a modius, and what is a balance, how shall we be able to measure
or weigh anything? 

In this case, then, if we have not fully learned and accurately examined
the criterion of all other things, by which the other things are learned,
shall we be able to examine accurately and to learn fully anything
else? "Yes; but the modius is only wood, and a thing which produces
no fruit." But it is a thing which can measure corn. "Logic also produces
no fruit." As to this indeed we shall see: but then even if a man
should rant this, it is enough that logic has the power of distinguishing
and examining other things, and, as we may say, of measuring and weighing
them. Who says this? Is it only Chrysippus, and Zeno, and Cleanthes?
And does not Antisthenes say so? And who is it that has written that
the examination of names is the beginning of education? And does not
Socrates say so? And of whom does Xenophon write, that he began with
the examination of names, what each name signified? Is this then the
great and wondrous thing to understand or interpret Chrysippus? Who
says this? What then is the wondrous thing? To understand the will
of nature. Well then do you apprehend it yourself by your own power?
and what more have you need of? For if it is true that all men err
involuntarily, and you have learned the truth, of necessity you must
act right. "But in truth I do not apprehend the will of nature." Who
then tells us what it is? They say that it is Chrysippus. I proceed,
and I inquire what this interpreter of nature says. I begin not to
understand what he says; I seek an interpreter of Chrysippus. "Well,
consider how this is said, just as if it were said in the Roman tongue."
What then is this superciliousness of the interpreter? There is no
superciliousness which can justly he charged even to Chrysippus, if
he only interprets the will of nature, but does not follow it himself;
and much more is this so with his interpreter. For we have no need
of Chrysippus for his own sake, but in order that we may understand
nature. Nor do we need a diviner on his own account, but because we
think that through him we shall know the future and understand the
signs given by the gods; nor do we need the viscera of animals for
their own sake, but because through them signs are given; nor do we
look with wonder on the crow or raven, but on God, who through them
gives signs? 

I go then to the interpreter of these things and the sacrificer, and
I say, "Inspect the viscera for me, and tell me what signs they give."
The man takes the viscera, opens them, and interprets them: "Man,"
he says, "you have a will free by nature from hindrance and compulsion;
this is written here in the viscera. I will show you this first in
the matter of assent. Can any man hinder you from assenting to the
truth? No man can. Can any man compel you to receive what is false?
No man can. You see that in this matter you have the faculty of the
will free from hindrance, free from compulsion, unimpeded." Well,
then, in the matter of desire and pursuit of an object, is it otherwise?
And what can overcome pursuit except another pursuit? And what can
overcome desire and aversion except another desire and aversion? But,
you object: "If you place before me the fear of death, you do compel
me." No, it is not what is placed before you that compels, but your
opinion that it is better to do so-and-so than to die. In this matter,
then, it is your opinion that compelled you: that is, will compelled
will. For if God had made that part of Himself, which He took from
Himself and gave to us, of such a nature as to be hindered or compelled
either by Himself or by another, He would not then be God nor would
He be taking care of us as He ought. "This," says the diviner, "I
find in the victims: these are the things which are signified to you.
If you choose, you are free; if you choose, you will blame no one:
you will charge no one. All will be at the same time according to
your mind and the mind of God." For the sake of this divination I
go to this diviner and to the philosopher, not admiring him for this
interpretation, but admiring the things which he interprets.

Chapter 18

That we ought not to he angry with the errors of others 

If what philosophers say is true, that all men have one principle,
as in the case of assent the persuasion that a thing is so, and in
the case of dissent the persuasion that a thing is not so, and in
the case of a suspense of judgment the persuasion that a thing is
uncertain, so also in the case of a movement toward anything the persuasion
that a thing is for a man's advantage, and it is impossible to think
that one thing is advantageous and to desire another, and to judge
one thing to be proper and to move toward another, why then are we
angry with the many? "They are thieves and robbers," you may say.
What do you mean by thieves and robbers? "They are mistaken about
good and evil." Ought we then to be angry with them, or to pity them?
But show them their error, and you will see how they desist from their
errors. If they do not see their errors, they have nothing superior
to their present opinion. 

"Ought not then this robber and this adulterer to be destroyed?" By
no means say so, but speak rather in this way: "This man who has been
mistaken and deceived about the most important things, and blinded,
not in the faculty of vision which distinguishes white and black,
but in the faculty which distinguishes good and bad, should we not
destroy him?" If you speak thus, you will see how inhuman this is
which you say, and that it is just as if you would say, "Ought we
not to destroy this blind and deaf man?" But if the greatest harm
is the privation of the greatest things, and the greatest thing in
every man is the will or choice such as it ought to be, and a man
is deprived of this will, why are you also angry with him? Man, you
ought not to be affected contrary to nature by the bad things of another.
Pity him rather: drop this readiness to be offended and to hate, and
these words which the many utter: "These accursed and odious fellows."
How have you been made so wise at once? and how are you so peevish?
Why then are we angry? Is it because we value so much the things of
which these men rob us? Do not admire your clothes, and then you will
not be angry with the thief. Do not admire the beauty of your wife,
and you will not be angry with the adulterer. Learn that a thief and
an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in those
which belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismiss
these things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still
angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourself
rather than with the thief and the adulterer. Consider the matter
thus: you have fine clothes; your neighbor has not: you have a window;
you wish to air the clothes. The thief does not know wherein man's
good consists, but he thinks that it consists in having fine clothes,
the very thing which you also think. Must he not then come and take
them away? When you show a cake to greedy persons, and swallow it
all yourself, do you expect them not to snatch it from you? Do not
provoke them: do not have a window: do not air your clothes. I also
lately had an iron lamp placed by the side of my household gods: hearing
a noise at the door, I ran down, and found that the lamp had been
carried off. I reflected that he who had taken the lamp had done nothing
strange. What then? To-morrow, I said, you will find an earthen lamp:
for a man only loses that which he has. "I have lost my garment."
The reason is that you had a garment. "I have pain in my head." Have
you any pain in your horns? Why then are you troubled? for we only
lose those things, we have only pains about those things which we
possess. 

"But the tyrant will chain." What? the leg. "He will take away." What?
the neck. What then will he not chain and not take away? the will.
This is why the ancients taught the maxim, "Know thyself." Therefore
we ought to exercise ourselves in small things and, beginning with
them, to proceed to the greater. "I have pain in the head." Do not
say, "Alas!" "I have pain in the ear." Do not say, "Alas!" And I do
not say that you are not allowed to groan, but do not groan inwardly;
and if your slave is slow in bringing a bandage, do not cry out and
torment yourself, and say, "Everybody hates me": for who would not
hate such a man? For the future, relying on these opinions, walk about
upright, free; not trusting to the size of your body, as an athlete,
for a man ought not to be invincible in the way that an ass is.

Who then is the invincible? It is he whom none of the things disturb
which are independent of the will. Then examining one circumstance
after another I observe, as in the case of an athlete; he has come
off victorious in the first contest: well then, as to the second?
and what if there should be great heat? and what, if it should be
at Olympia? And the same I say in this case: if you should throw money
in his way, he will despise it. Well, suppose you put a young girl
in his way, what then? and what, if it is in the dark? what if it
should be a little reputation, or abuse; and what, if it should be
praise; and what if it should be death? He is able to overcome all.
What then if it be in heat, and what if it is in the rain, and what
if he be in a melancholy mood, and what if he be asleep? He will still
conquer. This is my invincible athlete. 

Chapter 19

How we should behave to tyrants 

If a man possesses any superiority, or thinks that he does, when he
does not, such a man, if he is uninstructed, will of necessity be
puffed up through it. For instance, the tyrant says, "I am master
of all." And what can you do for me? Can you give me desire which
shall have no hindrance? How can you? Have you the infallible power
of avoiding what you would avoid? Have you the power of moving toward
an object without error? And how do you possess this power? Come,
when you are in a ship, do you trust to yourself or to the helmsman?
And when you are in a chariot, to whom do you trust but to the driver?
And how is it in all other arts? Just the same. In what then lies
your power? "All men pay respect to me." Well, I also pay respect
to my platter, and I wash it and wipe it; and for the sake of my oil
flask, I drive a peg into the wall. Well then, are these things superior
to me? No, but they supply some of my wants, and for this reason I
take care of them. Well, do I not attend to my ass? Do I not wash
his feet? Do I not clean him? Do you not know that every man has regard
to himself, and to you just the same as he has regard to his ass?
For who has regard to you as a man? Show me. Who wishes to become
like you? Who imitates you, as he imitates Socrates? "But I can cut
off your head." You say right. I had forgotten that I must have regard
to you, as I would to a fever and the bile, and raise an altar to
you, as there is at Rome an altar to fever. 

What is it then that disturbs and terrifies the multitude? is it the
tyrant and his guards? I hope that it is not so. It is not possible
that what is by nature free can be disturbed by anything else, or
hindered by any other thing than by itself. But it is a man's own
opinions which disturb him: for when the tyrant says to a man, "I
will chain your leg," he who values his leg says, "Do not; have pity":
but he who values his own will says, "If it appears more advantageous
to you, chain it." "Do you not care?" I do not care. "I will show
you that I am master." You cannot do that. Zeus has set me free: do
you think that he intended to allow his own son to be enslaved? But
you are master of my carcass: take it. "So when you approach me, you
have no regard to me?" No, but I have regard to myself; and if you
wish me to say that I have regard to you also, I tell you that I have
the same regard to you that I have to my pipkin. 

This is not a perverse self-regard, for the animal is constituted
so as to do all things for itself. For even the sun does all things
for itself; nay, even Zeus himself. But when he chooses to be the
Giver of rain and the Giver of fruits, and the Father of gods and
men, you see that he cannot obtain these functions and these names,
if he is not useful to man; and, universally, he has made the nature
of the rational animal such that it cannot obtain any one of its own
proper interests, if it does not contribute something to the common
interest. In this manner and sense it is not unsociable for a man
to do everything, for the sake of himself. For what do you expect?
that a man should neglect himself and his own interest? And how in
that case can there be one and the same principle in all animals,
the principle of attachment to themselves? 

What then? when absurd notions about things independent of our will,
as if they were good and bad, lie at the bottom of our opinions, we
must of necessity pay regard to tyrants; for I wish that men would
pay regard to tyrants only, and not also to the bedchamber men. How
is it that the man becomes all at once wise, when Caesar has made
him superintendent of the close stool? How is it that we say immediately,
"Felicion spoke sensibly to me." I wish he were ejected from the bedchamber,
that he might again appear to you to be a fool. 

Epaphroditus had a shoemaker whom he sold because he was good for
nothing. This fellow by some good luck was bought by one of Caesar's
men, and became Caesar's shoemaker. You should have seen what respect
Epaphroditus paid to him: "How does the good Felicion do, I pray?"
Then if any of us asked, "What is master doing?" the answer "He is
consulting about something with Felicion." Had he not sold the man
as good for nothing? Who then made him wise all at once? This is an
instance of valuing something else than the things which depend on
the will. 

Has a man been exalted to the tribuneship? All who meet him offer
their congratulations; one kisses his eyes, another the neck, and
the slaves kiss his hands. He goes to his house, he finds torches
lighted. He ascends the Capitol: he offers a sacrifice of the occasion.
Now who ever sacrificed for having had good desires? for having acted
conformably to nature? For in fact we thank the gods for those things
in which we place our good. 

A person was talking to me to-day about the priesthood of Augustus.
I say to him: "Man, let the thing alone: you will spend much for no
purpose." But he replies, "Those who draw up agreements will write
any name." Do you then stand by those who read them, and say to such
persons, "It is I whose name is written there;" And if you can now
be present on all such occasions, what will you do when you are dead?
"My name will remain." Write it on a stone, and it will remain. But
come, what remembrance of you will there be beyond Nicopolis? "But
I shall wear a crown of gold." If you desire a crown at all, take
a crown of roses and put it on, for it will be more elegant in appearance.

Chapter 20

About reason, how it contemplates itself 

Every art and faculty contemplates certain things especially. When
then it is itself of the same kind with the objects which it contemplates,
it must of necessity contemplate itself also: but when it is of an
unlike kind, it cannot contemplate itself. For instance, the shoemaker's
art is employed on skins, but itself is entirely distinct from the
material of skins: for this reason it does not contemplate itself.
Again, the grammarian's art is employed about articulate speech; is
then the art also articulate speech? By no means. For this reason
it is not able to contemplate itself. Now reason, for what purpose
has it been given by nature? For the right use of appearances. What
is it then itself? A system of certain appearances. So by its nature
it has the faculty of contemplating itself so. Again, sound sense,
for the contemplation of what things does it belong to us? Good and
evil, and things which are neither. What is it then itself? Good.
And want of sense, what is it? Evil. Do you see then that good sense
necessarily contemplates both itself and the opposite? For this reason
it is the chief and the first work of a philosopher to examine appearances,
and to distinguish them, and to admit none without examination. You
see even in the matter of coin, in which our interest appears to be
somewhat concerned, how we have invented an art, and how many means
the assayer uses to try the value of coin, the sight, the touch, the
smell, and lastly the hearing. He throws the coin down, and observes
the sound, and he is not content with its sounding once, but through
his great attention he becomes a musician. In like manner, where we
think that to be mistaken and not to be mistaken make a great difference,
there we apply great attention to discovering the things which can
deceive. But in the matter of our miserable ruling faculty, yawning
and sleeping, we carelessly admit every appearance, for the harm is
not noticed. 

When then you would know how careless you are with respect to good
and evil, and how active with respect to things which are indifferent,
observe how you feel with respect to being deprived of the sight of
eyes, and how with respect of being deceived, and you will discover
you are far from feeling as you ought to in relation to good and evil.
"But this is a matter which requires much preparation, and much labor
and study." Well then do you expect to acquire the greatest of arts
with small labor? And yet the chief doctrine of philosophers is brief.
If you would know, read Zeno's writings and you will see. For how
few words it requires to say man's end is to follow the god's, and
that the nature of good is a proper use of appearances. But if you
say "What is 'God,' what is 'appearance,' and what is 'particular'
and what is 'universal nature'? then indeed many words are necessary.
If then Epicures should come and say that the good must be in the
body; in this case also many words become necessary, and we must be
taught what is the leading principle in us, and the fundamental and
the substantial; and as it is not probable that the good of a snail
is in the shell, is it probable that the good of a man is in the body?
But you yourself, Epicurus, possess something better than this. What
is that in you which deliberates, what is that which examines everything,
what is that which forms a judgement about the body itself, that it
is the principle part? and why do you light your lamp and labor for
us, and write so many books? is it that we may not be ignorant of
the truth, who we are, and what we are with respect to you? Thus the
discussion requires many words. 

Chapter 21

Against those who wish to be admired 

When a man holds his proper station in life, he does not gape after
things beyond it. Man, what do you wish to happen to you? "I am satisfied
if I desire and avoid conformably to nature, if I employ movements
toward and from an object as I am by nature formed to do, and purpose
and design and assent." Why then do you strut before us as if you
had swallowed a spit? "My wish has always been that those who meet
me should admire me, and those who follow me should exclaim, 'Oh,
the great philosopher.'" Who are they by whom you wish to be admired?
Are they not those of whom you are used to say that they are mad?
Well then do you wish to be admired by madmen? 

Chapter 22

On precognitions 

Precognitions are common to all men, and precognition is not contradictory
to precognition. For who of us does not assume that Good is useful
and eligible, and in all circumstances that we ought to follow and
pursue it? And who of us does not assume that justice is beautiful
and becoming? When, then, does the contradiction arise? It arises
in the adaptation of the precognitions to the particular cases. When
one man says, "He has done well: he is a brave man," and another says,
"Not so; but he has acted foolishly"; then the disputes arise among
men. This is the dispute among the Jews and the Syrians and the Egyptians
and the Romans; not whether holiness should be preferred to all things
and in all cases should be pursued, but whether it is holy to eat
pig's flesh or not holy. You will find this dispute also between Agamemnon
and Achilles; for call them forth. What do you say, Agamemnon ought
not that to be done which is proper and right? "Certainly." Well,
what do you say, Achilles? do you not admit that what is good ought
to be done? "I do most certainly." Adapt your precognitions then to
the present matter. Here the dispute begins. Agamemnon says, "I ought
not to give up Chryseis to her father." Achilles says, "You ought."
It is certain that one of the two makes a wrong adaptation of the
precognition of ought" or "duty." Further, Agamemnon says, "Then if
I ought to restore Chryseis, it is fit that I take his prize from
some of you." Achilles replies, "Would you then take her whom I love?"
"Yes, her whom you love." "Must I then be the only man who goes without
a prize? and must I be the only man who has no prize?" Thus the dispute
begins. 

What then is education? Education is the learning how to adapt the
natural precognitions to the particular things conformably to nature;
and then to distinguish that of things some are in our power, but
others are not; in our power are will and all acts which depend on
the will; things not in our power are the body, the parts of the body,
possessions, parents, brothers, children, country, and, generally,
all with whom we live in society. In what, then, should we place the
good? To what kind of things shall we adapt it? "To the things which
are in our power?" Is not health then a good thing, and soundness
of limb, and life? and are not children and parents and country? Who
will tolerate you if you deny this? 

Let us then transfer the notion of good to these things. is it possible,
then, when a man sustains damage and does not obtain good things,
that he can be happy? "It is not possible." And can he maintain toward
society a proper behavior? He cannot. For I am naturally formed to
look after my own interest. If it is my interest to have an estate
in land, it is my interest also to take it from my neighbor. If it
is my interest to have a garment, it is my interest also to steal
it from the bath. This is the origin of wars, civil commotions, tyrannies,
conspiracies. And how shall I be still able to maintain my duty toward
Zeus? for if I sustain damage and am unlucky, he takes no care of
me; and what is he to me if he allows me to be in the condition in
which I am? I now begin to hate him. Why, then, do we build temples,
why set up statues to Zeus, as well as to evil demons, such as to
Fever; and how is Zeus the Saviour, and how the Giver of rain, and
the Giver of fruits? And in truth if we place the nature of Good in
any such things, all this follows. 

What should we do then? This is the inquiry of the true philosopher
who is in labour. "Now I do not see what the Good is nor the Bad.
Am I not mad? Yes." But suppose that I place the good somewhere among
the things which depend on the will: all will laugh at me. There will
come some grey-head wearing many gold rings on his fingers and he
will shake his head and say, "Hear, my child. It is right that you
should philosophize; but you ought to have some brains also: all this
that you are doing is silly. You learn the syllogism from philosophers;
but you know how to act better than philosophers do." Man, why then
do you blame me, if I know? What shall I say to this slave? If I am
silent, he will burst. I must speak in this way: "Excuse me, as you
would excuse lovers: I am not my own master: I am mad." 

Chapter 23

Against Epicurus

    Even Epicurus perceives that we are by nature social, but having once
placed our good in the husk he is no longer able to say anything else. For on
the other hand he strongly maintains this, that we ought not to admire nor to
accept anything which is detached from the nature of good; and he is right in
maintaining this. How then are we [suspicious], if we have no natural affection
to our children? Why do you advise the wise man not to bring up children? Why
are you afraid that he may thus fall into trouble? For does he fall into
trouble on account of the mouse which is nurtured in the house? What does he
care if a little mouse in the house makes lamentation to him? But Epicurus
knows that if once a child is born, it is no longer in our power not to love it
nor care about it. For this reason, Epicurus says that a man who has any sense
also does not engage in political matters; for he knows what a man must do who
is engaged in such things; for, indeed, if you intend to behave among men as
you do among a swarm of flies, what hinders you? But Epicurus, who knows this,
ventures to say that we should not bring up children. But a sheep does not
desert its own offspring, nor yet a wolf; and shall a man desert his child?
What do you mean? that we should be as silly as sheep? but not even do they
desert their offspring: or as savage as wolves, but not even do wolves desert
their young. Well, who would follow your advice, if he saw his child weeping
after falling on the ground? For my part I think that, even if your mother and
your father had been told by an oracle that you would say what you have said,
they would not have cast you away.

Chapter 24

How we should struggle with circumstances

    It is circumstances which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty
falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you
with a rough young man. "For what purpose?" you may say, Why, that you may
become an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished without sweat. In my
opinion no man has had a more profitable difficulty than you have had, if you
choose to make use of it as an athlete would deal with a young antagonist. We
are now sending a scout to Rome; but no man sends a cowardly scout, who, if he
only hears a noise and sees a shadow anywhere, comes running back in terror and
reports that the enemy is close at hand. So now if you should come and tell us,
"Fearful is the state of affairs at Rome, terrible is death, terrible is exile;
terrible is calumny; terrible is poverty; fly, my friends; the enemy is near";
we shall answer, "Begone, prophesy for yourself; we have committed only one
fault, that we sent such a scout."
    Diogenes, who was sent as a scout before you, made a different report to
us. He says that death is no evil, for neither is it base: he says that fame is
the noise of madmen. And what has this spy said about pain, about pleasure, and
about poverty? He says that to be naked is better than any purple robe, and to
sleep on the bare ground is the softest bed; and he gives as a proof of each
thing that he affirms his own courage, his tranquillity his freedom, and the
healthy appearance and compactness of his body. "There is no enemy he says;
"all is peace." How so, Diogenes? "See," he replies, "if I am struck, if I have
been wounded, if I have fled from any man." This is what a scout ought to be.
But you come to us and tell us one thing after another. Will you not go back,
and you will see clearer when you have laid aside fear?
    What then shall I do? What do you do when you leave a ship? Do you take
away the helm or the oars? What then do you take away? You take what is your
own, your bottle and your wallet; and now if you think of what is your own, you
will never claim what belongs to others. The emperor says, "Lay aside your
laticlave." See, I put on the angusticlave. "Lay aside this also." See, I have
only my toga. "Lay aside your toga." See, I am naked. "But you still raise my
envy." Take then all my poor body; when, at a man's command, I can throw away
my poor body, do I still fear him?
    "But a certain person will not leave to me the succession to his estate."
What then? had I forgotten that not one of these things was mine. How then do
we call them mine? just as we call the bed in the inn. If, then, the innkeeper
at his death leaves you the beds, all well; but if he leaves them to another,
he will have them, and you will seek another bed. If then you shall not find
one, you will sleep on the ground: only sleep with a good will and snore, and
remember that tragedies have their place among the rich and kings and tyrants,
but no poor man fills a part in the tragedy, except as one of the chorus. Kings
indeed commence with prosperity: "ornament the palaces with garlands," then
about the third or fourth act they call out, "O Cithaeron, why didst thou
receive me?" Slave, where are the crowns, where the diadem? The guards help
thee not at all. When then you approach any of these persons, remember this
that you are approaching a tragedian, not the actor but OEdipus himself. But
you say, "Such a man is happy; for he walks about with many," and I also place
myself with the many and walk about with many. In sum remember this: the door
is open; be not more timid than little children, but as they say, when the
thing does not please them, "I will play no loner," so do you, when things seem
to you of such a kind, say I will no longer play, and begone: but if you stay,
do not complain.

Chapter 25

On the same

    If these things are true, and if we are not silly, and are not acting
hypocritically when we say that the good of man is in the will, and the evil
too, and that everything else does not concern us, why are we still disturbed,
why are we still afraid? The things about which we have been busied are in no
man's power: and the things which are in the power of others, we care not for.
What kind of trouble have we still?
    "But give me directions." Why should I give you directions? has not Zeus
given you directions? Has he not given to you what is your own free from
hindrance and free from impediment, and what is not your own subject to
hindrance and impediment? What directions then, what kind of orders did you
bring when you came from him? Keep by every means what is your own; do not
desire what belongs to others. Fidelity is your own, virtuous shame is your
own; who then can take these things from you? who else than yourself will
hinder you from using them? But how do you act? when you seek what is not your
own, you lose that which is your own. Having such promptings and commands from
Zeus, what kind do you still ask from me? Am I more powerful than he, am I more
worthy of confidence? But if you observe these, do you want any others besides?
"Well, but he has not given these orders" you will say. Produce your
precognitions, produce the proofs of philosophers, produce what you have often
heard, and produce what you have said yourself, produce what you have read,
produce what you have meditated on (and you will then see that all these things
are from God). How long, then, is it fit to observe these precepts from God,
and not to break up the play? As long as the play is continued with propriety.
In the Saturnalia a king is chosen by lot, for it has been the custom to play
at this game. The king commands: "Do you drink," "Do you mix the wine," "Do you
sing," "Do you go," "Do you come." I obey that the game may be broken up
through me. But if he says, "Think that you are in evil plight": I answer, "I
do not think so"; and who compel me to think so? Further, we agreed to play
Agamemnon and Achilles. He who is appointed to play Agamemnon says to me, "Go
to Achilles and tear from him Briseis." I go. He says, "Come," and I come.
    For as we behave in the matter of hypothetical arguments, so ought we to do
in life. "Suppose it to be night." I suppose that it is night. "Well then; is
it day?" No, for I admitted the hypothesis that it was night. "Suppose that you
think that it is night?" Suppose that I do. "But also think that it is night."
That is not consistent with the hypothesis. So in this case also: "Suppose that
you are unfortunate." Well, suppose so. "Are you then unhappy?" Yes. "Well,
then, are you troubled with an unfavourable demon?" Yes. "But think also that
you are in misery." This is not consistent with the hypothesis; and Another
forbids me to think so.
    How long then must we obey such orders? As long as it is profitable; and
this means as long as I maintain that which is becoming and consistent.
Further, some men are sour and of bad temper, and they say, "I cannot sup with
this man to be obliged to hear him telling daily how he fought in Mysia: 'I
told you, brother, how I ascended the hill: then I began to be besieged
again.'" But another says, "I prefer to get my supper and to hear him talk as
much as he likes." And do you compare these estimates: only do nothing in a
depressed mood, nor as one afflicted, nor as thinking that you are in misery,
for no man compels you to that. Has it smoked in the chamber? If the smoke is
moderate, I will stay; if it is excessive, I go out: for you must always
remember this and hold it fast, that the door is open. Well, but you say to me,
"Do not live in Nicopolis." I will not live there. "Nor in Athens." I will not
live in Athens. "Nor in Rome." I will not live in Rome. "Live in Gyarus." I
will live in Gyarus, but it seems like a great smoke to live in Gyarus; and I
depart to the place where no man will hinder me from living, for that
dwelling-place is open to all; and as to the last garment, that is the poor
body, no one has any power over me beyond this. This was the reason why
Demetrius said to Nero, "You threaten me with death, but nature threatens you."
If I set my admiration on the poor body, I have given myself up to be a slave:
if on my little possessions, I also make myself a slave: for I immediately make
it plain with what I may be caught; as if the snake draws in his head, I tell
you to strike that part of him which he guards; and do you he assured that
whatever part you choose to guard, that part your master will attack.
Remembering this, whom will you still flatter or fear?
    "But I should like to sit where the Senators sit." Do you see that you are
putting yourself in straits, you are squeezing yourself. "How then shall I see
well in any other way in the amphitheatre?" Man, do not be a spectator at all;
and you will not be squeezed. Why do you give yourself trouble? Or wait a
little, and when the spectacle is over, seat yourself in the place reserved for
the Senators and sun yourself. For remember this general truth, that it is we
who squeeze ourselves, who put ourselves in straits; that is, our opinions
squeeze us and put us in straits. For what is it to be reviled? Stand by a
stone and revile it; and what will you gain? If, then, a man listens like a
stone, what profit is there to the reviler? But if the reviler has as a
stepping-stone the weakness of him who is reviled, then he accomplishes
something. "Strip him." What do you mean by "him"? Lay hold of his garment,
strip it off. "I have insulted you." Much good may it do you.
    This was the practice of Socrates: this was the reason why he always had
one face. But we choose to practice and study anything rather than the means by
which we shall be unimpeded and free. You say, "Philosophers talk paradoxes."
But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? and what is more paradoxical than
to puncture a man's eye in order that he may see? If any one said this to a man
ignorant of the surgical art, would he not ridicule the speaker? Where is the
wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical
to the inexperienced?

Chapter 27

In how many ways appearances exist, and what aids we should provide against
                                     them

    Appearances to us in four ways: for either things appear as they are; or
they are not, and do not even appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to
be; or they are not, and yet appear to be. Further, in all these cases to form
a right judgement is the office of an educated man. But whatever it is that
annoys us, to that we ought to apply a remedy. If the sophisms of Pyrrho and of
the Academics are what annoys, we must apply the remedy to them. If it is the
persuasion of appearances, by which some things appear to be good, when they
are not good, let us seek a remedy for this. If it is habit which annoys us, we
must try to seek aid against habit. What aid then can we find against habit,
The contrary habit. You hear the ignorant say: "That unfortunate person is
dead: his father and mother are overpowered with sorrow; he was cut off by an
untimely death and in a foreign land." Here the contrary way of speaking: tear
yourself from these expressions: oppose to one habit the contrary habit; to
sophistry oppose reason, and the exercise and discipline of reason; against
persuasive appearances we ought to have manifest precognitions, cleared of all
impurities and ready to hand.
    When death appears an evil, we ought to have this rule in readiness, that
it is fit to avoid evil things, and that death is a necessary thing. For what
shall I do, and where shall I escape it? Suppose that I am not Sarpedon, the
son of Zeus, nor able to speak in this noble way: "I will go and I am resolved
either to behave bravely myself or to give to another the opportunity of doing
so; if I cannot succeed in doing anything myself, I will not grudge another the
doing of something noble." Suppose that it is above our power to act thus; is
it not in our power to reason thus? Tell me where I can escape death: discover
for me the country, show me the men to whom I must go, whom death does not
visit. Discover to me a charm against death. If I have not one, what do you
wish me to do? I cannot escape from death. Shall I not escape from the fear of
death, but shall I die lamenting and trembling? For the origin of perturbation
is this, to wish for something, and that this should not happen. Therefore if I
am able to change externals according to my wish, I change them; but if I
cannot, I am ready to tear out the eyes of him who hinders me. For the nature
of man is not to endure to be deprived of the good, and not to endure the
falling into the evil. Then, at last, when I am neither able to change
circumstances nor to tear out the eyes of him who hinders me, I sit down and
groan, and abuse whom I can, Zeus and the rest of the gods. For if they do not
care for me, what are they to me? "Yes, but you will be an impious man." In
what respect then will it be worse for me than it is now? To sum up, remember
this that unless piety and your interest be in the same thing, piety cannot be
maintained in any man. Do not these things seem necessary?
    Let the followers of Pyrrho and the Academics come and make their
objections. For I, as to my part, have no leisure for these disputes, nor am I
able to undertake the defense of common consent. If I had a suit even about a
bit of land, I would call in another to defend my interests. With what evidence
then am I satisfied? With that which belongs to the matter in hand. How indeed
perception is effected, whether through the whole body or any part, perhaps I
cannot explain: for both opinions perplex me. But that you and I are not the
same, I know with perfect certainty. "How do you know it?" When I intend to
swallow anything, I never carry it to your b month, but to my own. When I
intend to take bread, I never lay hold of a broom, but I always go to the bread
as to a mark. And you yourselves who take away the evidence of the senses, do
you act otherwise? Who among you, when he intended to enter a bath, ever went
into a mill?
    What then? Ought we not with all our power to hold to this also, the
maintaining of general opinion, and fortifying ourselves against the arguments
which are directed against it? Who denies that we ought to do this? Well, he
should do it who is able, who has leisure for it; but as to him who trembles
and is perturbed and is inwardly broken in heart, he must employ his time
better on something else.

Chapter 28

That we ought not to he angry with men; and what are the small and the great
                               things among men

    What is the cause of assenting to anything? The fact that it appears to be
true. It is not possible then to assent to that which appears not to be true.
Why? Because this is the nature of the understanding, to incline to the true,
to be dissatisfied with the false, and in matters uncertain to withhold assent.
What is the proof of this? "Imagine, if you can, that it is now night." It is
not possible. "Take away your persuasion that it is day." It is not possible.
"Persuade yourself or take away your persuasion that the stars are even in
number." It is impossible. When, then, any man assents to that which is false,
be assured that he did not intend to assent to it as false, for every soul is
unwillingly deprived of the truth, as Plato says; but the falsity seemed to him
to be true. Well, in acts what have we of the like kind as we have here truth
or falsehood? We have the fit and the not fit, the profitable and the
unprofitable, that which is suitable to a person and that which is not, and
whatever is like these. Can, then, a man think that a thing is useful to him
and not choose it? He cannot. How says Medea?
       "'Tis true I know what evil I shall do,
       But passion overpowers the better council.'"
She thought that to indulge her passion and take vengeance on her husband was
more profitable than to spare her children. "It was so; but she was deceived."
Show her plainly that she is deceived, and she will not do it; but so long as
you do not show it, what can she follow except that which appears to herself?
Nothing else. Why, then, are you angry with the unhappy woman that she has been
bewildered about the most important things, and is become a viper instead of a
human creature? And why not, if it is possible, rather pity, as we pity the
blind and the lame, those who are blinded and maimed in the faculties which are
supreme?
    Whoever, then, clearly remembers this, that to man the measure of every act
is the appearance- whether the thing appears good or bad: if good, he is free
from blame; if bad, himself suffers the penalty, for it is impossible that he
who is deceived can be one person, and he who suffers another person- whoever
remembers this will not be angry with any man, will not be vexed at any man,
will not revile or blame any man, nor hate nor quarrel with any man.
    "So then all these great and dreadful deeds have this origin, in the
appearance?" Yes, this origin and no other. The Iliad is nothing else than
appearance and the use of appearances. It appeared to Paris to carry off the
wife of Menelaus: it appeared to Helen to follow him. If then it had appeared
to Menelaus to feel that it was a gain to be deprived of such a wife, what
would have happened? Not only a wi would the Iliad have been lost, but the
Odyssey also. "On so small a matter then did such great things depend?" But
what do you mean by such great things? Wars and civil commotions, and the
destruction of many men and cities. And what great matter is this? "Is it
nothing?" But what great matter is the death of many oxen, and many sheep, and
many nests of swallows or storks being burnt or destroyed? "Are these things,
then, like those?" Very like. Bodies of men are destroyed, and the bodies of
oxen and sheep; the dwellings of men are burnt, and the nests of storks. What
is there in this great or dreadful? Or show me what is the difference between a
man's house and a stork's nest, as far as each is a dwelling; except that man
builds his little houses of beams and tiles and bricks, and the stork builds
them of sticks and mud. "Are a stork and a man, then, like things?" What say
you? In body they are very much alike.
    "Does a man then differ in no respect from a stork?" Don't suppose that I
say so; but there is no difference in these matters. "In what, then, is the
difference?" Seek and you will find that there is a difference in another
matter. See whether it is not in a man the understanding of what he does, see
if it is not in social community, in fidelity, in modesty, in steadfastness, in
intelligence. Where then is the great good and evil in men? It is where the
difference is. If the difference is preserved and remains fenced round, and
neither modesty is destroyed, nor fidelity, nor intelligence, then the man also
is preserved; but if any of these things is destroyed and stormed like a city,
then the man too perishes; and in this consist the great things. Paris, you
say, sustained great damage, then, when the Hellenes invaded and when they
ravaged Troy, and when his brothers perished. By no means; for no man is
damaged by an action which is not his own; but what happened at that time was
only the destruction of storks' nests: now the ruin of Paris was when he lost
the character of modesty, fidelity, regard to hospitality, and to decency. When
was Achilles ruined? Was it when Patroclus died? Not so. But it happened when
he began to be angry, when he wept for a girl, when he forgot that he was at
Troy not to get mistresses, but to fight. These things are the ruin of men,
this is being besieged, this is the destruction of cities, when right opinions
are destroyed, when they are corrupted.
    "When, then, women are carried off, when children are made captives, and
when the men are killed, are these not evils?" How is it then that you add to
the facts these opinions? Explain this to me also. "I shall not do that; but
how is it that you say that these are not evils?" Let us come to the rules:
produce the precognitions: for it is because this is neglected that we cannot
sufficiently wonder at what men do. When we intend to judge of weights, we do
not judge by guess: where we intend to judge of straight and crooked, we do not
judge by guess. In all cases where it is our interest to know what is true in
any matter, never will any man among us do anything by guess. But in things
which depend on the first and on the only cause of doing right or wrong, of
happiness or unhappiness, of being unfortunate or fortunate, there only we are
inconsiderate and rash. There is then nothing like scales, nothing like a rule:
but some appearance is presented, and straightway I act according to it. Must I
then suppose that I am superior to Achilles or Agamemnon, so that they by
following appearances do and suffer so many evils: and shall not the appearance
be sufficient for me? And what tragedy has any other beginning? The Atreus of
Euripides, what is it? An appearance. The OEdipus of Sophocles, what is it? An
appearance. The Phoenix? An appearance. The Hippolytus? An appearance. What
kind of a man then do you suppose him to be who pays no regard to this matter?
And what is the name of those who follow every appearance? "They are called
madmen." Do we then act at all differently?

Chapter 29

On constancy

    The being of the Good is a certain Will; the being of the Bad is a certain
kind of Will. What then are externals? Materials for the Will, about which the
will being conversant shall obtain its own good or evil. How shall it obtain
the good? If it does not admire the materials; for the opinions about the
materials, if the opinions are right, make the will good: but perverse and
distorted opinions make the will bad. God has fixed this law, and says, "If you
would have anything good, receive it from yourself." You say, "No, but I have
it from another." Do not so: but receive it from yourself. Therefore when the
tyrant threatens and calls me, I say, "Whom do you threaten If he says, "I will
put you in chains," I say, "You threaten my hands and my feet." If he says, "I
will cut off your head," I reply, "You threaten my head." If he says, "I will
throw you into prison," I say, "You threaten the whole of this poor body." If
he threatens me with banishment, I say the same. "Does he, then, not threaten
you at all?" If I feel that all these things do not concern me, he does not
threaten me at all; but if I fear any of them, it is I whom he threatens. Whom
then do I fear? the master of what? The master of things which are in my own
power? There is no such master. Do I fear the master of things which are not in
my power? And what are these things to me?
    "Do you philosophers then teach us to despise kings?" I hope not. Who among
us teaches to claim against them the power over things which they possess? Take
my poor body, take my property, take my reputation, take those who are about
me. If I advise any persons to claim these things, they may truly accuse me.
"Yes, but I intend to command your opinions also." And who has given you this
power? How can you conquer the opinion of another man? "By applying terror to
it," he replies, "I will conquer it." Do you not know that opinion conquers
itself, and is not conquered by another? But nothing else can conquer Will
except the Will itself. For this reason, too, the law of God is most powerful
and most just, which is this: "Let the stronger always be superior to the
weaker." "Ten are stronger than one." For what? For putting in chains, for
killing, for dragging whither they choose, for taking away what a man has. The
ten therefore conquer the one in this in which they are stronger. "In what then
are the ten weaker," If the one possess right opinions and the others do not.
"Well then, can the ten conquer in this matter?" How is it possible? If we were
placed in the scales, must not the heavier draw down the scale in which it is?
    "How strange, then, that Socrates should have been so treated by the
Athenians." Slave, why do you say Socrates? Speak of the thing as it is: how
strange that the poor body of Socrates should have been carried off and dragged
to prison by stronger men, and that any one should have given hemlock to the
poor body of Socrates, and that it should breathe out the life. Do these things
seem strange. do they seem unjust, do you on account of these things blame God?
Had Socrates then no equivalent for these things, Where, then, for him was the
nature of good? Whom shall we listen to, you or him? And what does Socrates
say? "Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot hurt me": and further, he
says, "If it so pleases God, so let it be."
    But show me that he who has the inferior principles overpowers him who is
superior in principles. You will never show this, nor come near showing it; for
this is the law of nature and of God that the superior shall always overpower
the inferior. In what? In that in which it is superior. One body is stronger
than another: many are stronger than one: the thief is stronger than he who is
not a thief. This is the reason why I also lost my lamp, because in wakefulness
the thief was superior to me. But the man bought the lamp at this price: for a
lamp he became a thief, a faithless fellow, and like a wild beast. This seemed
to him a good bargain. Be it so. But a man has seized me by the cloak, and is
drawing me to the public place: then others bawl out, "Philosopher, what has
been the use of your opinions? see you are dragged to prison, you are going to
be beheaded." And what system of philosophy could f have made so that, if a
stronger man should have laid hold of my cloak, I should not be dragged off;
that if ten men should have laid hold of me and cast me into prison, I should
not be cast in? Have I learned nothing else then? I have learned to see that
everything which happens, if it be independent of my will, is nothing to me. I
may ask if you have not gained by this. Why then do you seek advantage in
anything else than in that in which you have learned that advantage is?
    Then sitting in prison I say: "The man who cries out in this way neither
hears what words mean, nor understands what is said, nor does he care at all to
know what philosophers say or what they do. Let him alone."
    But now he says to the prisoner, "Come out from your prison." If you have
no further need of me in prison, I come out: if you should have need of me
again, I will enter the prison. "How long will you act thus?" So long as reason
requires me to be with the body: but when reason does not require this, take
away the body, and fare you well. Only we must not do it inconsiderately, nor
weakly, nor for any slight reason; for, on the other hand, God does not wish it
to be done, and he has need of such a world and such inhabitants in it. But if
he sounds the signal for retreat, as he did to Socrates, we must obey him who
gives the signal, as if he were a general.
    "Well, then, ought we to say such things to the many?" Why should we? Is it
not enough for a man to be persuaded himself? When children come clapping their
hands and crying out, "To-day is the good Saturnalia," do we say, "The
Saturnalia are not good?" By no means, but we clap our hands also. Do you also
then, when you are not able to make a man change his mind, be assured that he
is a child, and clap your hands with him, and if you do not choose to do this,
keep silent.
    A man must keep this in mind; and when he is called to any such difficulty,
he should know that the time is come for showing if he has been instructed. For
he who is come into a difficulty is like a young man from a school who has
practiced the resolution of syllogisms; and if any person proposes to him an
easy syllogism, he says, "Rather propose to me a syllogism which is skillfully
complicated that I may exercise myself on it." Even athletes are dissatisfied
with slight young men, and say "He cannot lift me." "This is a youth of noble
disposition." But when the time of trial is come, one of you must weep and say,
"I wish that I had learned more." A little more of what? If you did not learn
these things in order to show them in practice, why did you learn them? I think
that there is some one among you who are sitting here, who is suffering like a
woman in labour, and saying, "Oh, that such a difficulty does not present
itself to me as that which has come to this man; oh, that I should be wasting
my life in a corner, when I might be crowned at Olympia. When will any one
announce to me such a contest?" Such ought to be the disposition of all of you.
Even among the gladiators of Caesar there are some who complain grievously that
they are not brought forward and matched, and they offer up prayers to God and
address themselves to their superintendents entreating that they might fight.
And will no one among you show himself such? I would willingly take a voyage
for this purpose and see what my athlete is doing, how he is studying his
subject. "I do not choose such a subject," he says. Why, is it in your power to
take what subject you choose? There has been given to you such a body as you
have, such parents, such brethren, such a country, such a place in your
country: then you come to me and say, "Change my subject." Have you not
abilities which enable you to manage the subject which has been given to you?
"It is your business to propose; it is mine to exercise myself well." However,
you do not say so, but you say, "Do not propose to me such a tropic, but such:
do not urge against me such an objection, but such." There will be a time,
perhaps, when tragic actors will suppose that they are masks and buskins and
the long cloak. I say, these things, man, are your material and subject. Utter
something that we may know whether you are a tragic actor or a buffoon; for
both of you have all the rest in common. If any one then should take away the
tragic actor's buskins and his mask, and introduce him on the stage as a
phantom, is the tragic actor lost, or does he still remain? If he has voice, he
still remains.
    An example of another kind. "Assume the governorship of a province." I
assume it, and when I have assumed it, I show how an instructed man behaves.
"Lay aside the laticlave and, clothing yourself in rags, come forward in this
character." What then have I not the power of displaying a good voice? How,
then, do you now appear? As a witness summoned by God. "Come forward, you, and
bear testimony for me, for you are worthy to be brought forward as a witness by
me: is anything external to the will good or bad? do I hurt any man? have I
made every man's interest dependent on any man except himself?" What testimony
do you give for God? "I am in a wretched condition, Master, and I am
unfortunate; no man cares for me, no man gives me anything; all blame me, all
speak ill of me." Is this the evidence that you are going to give, and disgrace
his summons, who has conferred so much honour on you, and thought you worthy of
being called to bear such testimony?
    But suppose that he who has the power has declared, "I judge you to be
impious and profane." What has happened to you? "I have been judged to be
impious and profane?" Nothing else? "Nothing else." But if the same person had
passed judgment on an hypothetical syllogism, and had made a declaration, "the
conclusion that, if it is day, it is light, I declare to be false," what has
happened to the hypothetical syllogism? who is judged in this case? who has
been condemned? the hypothetical syllogism, or the man who has been deceived by
it? Does he, then, who has the power of making any declaration about you know
what is pious or impious? Has he studied it, and has he learned it? Where? From
whom? Then is it the fact that a musician pays no regard to him who declares
that the lowest chord in the lyre is the highest; nor yet a geometrician, if he
declares that the lines from the centre of a circle to the circumference are
not equal; and shall he who is really instructed pay any regard to the
uninstructed man when he pronounces judgment on what is pious and what is
impious, on what is just and unjust? Oh, the signal wrong done by the
instructed. Did they learn this here?
    Will you not leave the small arguments about these matters to others, to
lazy fellows, that they may sit in a corner and receive their sorry pay, or
grumble that no one gives them anything; and will you not come forward and make
use of what you have learned? For it is not these small arguments that are
wanted now: the writings of the Stoics are full of them. What then is the thing
which is wanted? A man who shall apply them, one who by his acts shall bear
testimony to his words. Assume, I, entreat you, this character, that we may no
longer use in the schools the examples of the ancients but may have some
example of our own.
    To whom then does the contemplation of these matters belong? To him who has
leisure, for man is an animal that loves contemplation. But it is shameful to
contemplate these things as runaway slaves do; we should sit, as in a theatre,
free from distraction, and listen at one time to the tragic actor, at another
time to the lute-player; and not do as slaves do. As soon as the slave has
taken his station he praises the actor and at the same time looks round: then
if any one calls out his master's name, the slave is immediately frightened and
disturbed. It is shameful for philosophers thus to contemplate the works of
nature. For what is a master? Man is not the master of man; but death is, and
life and pleasure and pain; for if he comes without these things, bring Caesar
to me and you will see how firm I am. But when he shall come with these things,
thundering and lightning, and when I am afraid of them, what do I do then
except to recognize my master like the runaway slave? But so long as I have any
respite from these terrors, as a runaway slave stands in the theatre, so do I:
I bathe, I drink, I sing; but all this I do with terror and uneasiness. But if
I shall release myself from my masters, that is from those things by means of
which masters are formidable, what further trouble have I, what master have I
still?
    "What then, ought we to publish these things to all men?" No, but we ought
to accommodate ourselves to the ignorant and to say: "This man recommends to me
that which he thinks good for himself: I excuse him." For Socrates also excused
the gaoler, who had the charge of him in prison and was weeping when Socrates
was going to drink the poison, and said, "How generously he laments over us."
Does he then say to the gaoler that for this reason we have sent away the
women? No, but he says it to his friends who were able to hear it; and he
treats the gaoler as a child.

Chapter 30

What we ought to have ready in difficult circumstances

    When you are going into any great personage, remember that Another also
from above sees what is going on, and that you ought to please Him rather than
the other. He, then, who sees from above asks you: "In the schools what used
you to say about exile and bonds and death and disgrace?" I used to say that
they are things indifferent. "What then do you say of them now? Are they
changed at all?" No. "Are you changed then?" No. "Tell me then what things are
indifferent?" The things which are independent of the will. "Tell me, also,
what follows from this." The things which are independent of the will are
nothing to me. "Tell me also about the Good, what was your opinion?" A will
such as we ought to have and also such a use of appearances. "And the end, what
is it?" To follow Thee. "Do you say this now also?" I say the same now also.
    Then go into the great personage boldly and remember these things; and you
will see what a youth is who has studied these things when he is among men who
have not studied them. I indeed imagine that you will have such thoughts as
these: "Why do we make so great and so many preparations for nothing? Is this
the thing which men name power? Is this the antechamber? this the men of the
bedchamber? this the armed guards? Is it for this that I listened to so many
discourses? All this is nothing: but I have been preparing myself for something
great."

BOOK TWO

Chapter 1

That confidence is not inconsistent with caution

    The opinion of the philosophers, perhaps, seems to some to be a paradox;
but still let us examine as well as we can, if it is true that it is possible
to do everything both with caution and with confidence. For caution seems to be
in a manner contrary to confidence, and contraries are in no way consistent.
That which seems to many to be a paradox in the matter under consideration in
my opinion is of this kind: if we asserted that we ought to employ caution and
in the same things, men might justly accuse us of bringing together things
which cannot be united. But now where is the difficulty in what is said? for if
these things are true, which have been often said and often proved, that the
nature of good is in the use of appearances, and the nature of evil likewise,
and that things independent of our will do not admit either the nature of evil
nor of good, what paradox do the philosophers assert if they say that where
things are not dependent on the will, there you should employ confidence, but
where they are dependent on the will, there you should employ caution? For if
the bad consists in a bad exercise of the will, caution ought only to be used
where things are dependent on the will. But if things independent of the will
and not in our power are nothing to us, with respect to these we must employ
confidence; and thus we shall both be cautious and confident, and indeed
confident because of our caution. For by employing caution toward things which
are really bad, it will result that we shall have confidence with respect to
things which are not so.
    We are then in the condition of deer; when they flee from the huntsmen's
feathers in fright, whither do they turn and in what do they seek refuge as
safe? They turn to the nets, and thus they perish by confounding things which
are objects of fear with things that they ought not to fear. Thus we also act:
in what cases do we fear? In things which are independent of the will. In what
cases, on the contrary, do we behave with confidence, as if there were no
danger? In things dependent on the will. To be deceived then, or to act rashly,
or shamelessly or with base desire to seek something, does not concern us at
all, if we only hit the mark in things which are independent of our will. But
where there is death, or exile or pain or infamy, there we attempt or examine
to run away, there we are struck with terror. Therefore, as we may expect it to
happen with those who err in the greatest matters, we convert natural
confidence into audacity, desperation, rashness, shamelessness; and we convert
natural caution and modesty into cowardice and meanness, which are full of fear
and confusion. For if a man should transfer caution to those things in which
the will may be exercised and the acts of the will, he will immediately, by
willing to be cautious, have also the power of avoiding what he chooses: but if
he transfer it to the things which are not in his power and will, and attempt
to avoid the things which are in the power of others, he will of necessity
fear, he will be unstable, he will be disturbed. For death or pain is not
formidable, but the fear of pain or death. For this reason we commend the poet
who said
       Not death is evil, but a shameful death.
Confidence then ought to be employed against death, and caution against the
fear of death. But now we do the contrary, and employ against death the attempt
to escape; and to our opinion about it we employ carelessness, rashness and
indifference. These things Socrates properly used to call "tragic masks"; for
as to children masks appear terrible and fearful from inexperience, we also are
affected in like manner by events for no other reason than children are by
masks. For what is a child? Ignorance. What is a child? Want of knowledge. For
when a child knows these things, he is in no way inferior to us. What is death?
A "tragic mask." Turn it and examine it. See, it does not bite. The poor body
must be separated from the spirit either now or later, as it was separated from
it before. Why, then, are you troubled, if it be separated now? for if it is
not separated now, it will be separated afterward. Why? That the period of the
universe may be completed, for it has need of the present, and of the future,
and of the past. What is pain? A mask. Turn it and examine it. The poor flesh
is moved roughly, then, on the contrary, smoothly. If this does not satisfy
you, the door is open: if it does, bear. For the door ought to be open for all
occasions; and so we have no trouble.
    What then is the fruit of these opinions? It is that which ought to he the
most noble and the most becoming to those who are really educated, release from
perturbation, release from fear, freedom. For in these matters we must not
believe the many, who say that free persons only ought to be educated, but we
should rather believe the philosophers, who say that the educated only are
free. "How is this?" In this manner. Is freedom anything else than the power of
living as we choose? "Nothing else." Tell me then, ye men, do you wish to live
in error? "We do not." No one then who lives in error is free. Do you wish to
live in fear? Do you wish to live in sorrow? Do you wish to live in
perturbation? "By no means." No one, then, who is in a state of fear or sorrow
or perturbation is free; but whoever is delivered from sorrows and fears and
perturbations, he is at the same time also delivered from servitude. How then
can we continue to believe you, most dear legislators, when you say, "We only
allow free persons to be educated?" For philosophers say we allow none to be
free except the educated; that is, God does not allow it. "When then a man has
turned round before the praetor his own slave, has he done nothing?" He has
done something. "What?" He has turned round his own slave before the praetor.
"Has he done nothing, more?" Yes: he is also bound to pay for him the tax
called the twentieth. "Well then, is not the man who has gone through this
ceremony become free?" No more than he is become free from perturbations. Have
you who are able to turn round others no master? is not money your master, or a
girl or a boy, or some tyrant, or some friend of the tyrant? why do you tremble
then when you are going off to any trial of this kind? It is for this reason
that I often say: Study and hold in readiness these principles by which you may
determine what those things are with reference to which you ought to have
confidence, and those things with reference to which you ought to be cautious:
courageous in that which does not depend on your will; cautious in that which
does depend on it.
    "Well have I not read to you, and do you not know what I was doing?" In
what? "In my little dissertations." Show me how you are with respect to desire
and aversion; and show if you do not fail in getting what you wish, me and if
you do not fall into the things which you would avoid: but as to these long and
laboured sentences, you will take them and blot them out.
    "What then did not Socrates write?" And who wrote so much? But how? As he
could not always have at hand one to argue against his principles or to be
argued against in turn, he used to argue with and examine himself, and he was
always treating at least some one subject in a practical way. These are the
things which a philosopher writes. But little dissertations and that method,
which I speak of, he leaves to others, to the stupid, or to those happy men who
being free from perturbations have leisure, or to such as are too foolish to
reckon consequences.
    And will you now, when the opportunity invites, go and display those things
which you possess, and recite them, and make an idle show, and say, "See how I
make dialogues?" Do not so, my man: but rather say: "See how I am not
disappointed of that which I desire. See how I do not fall into that which I
would avoid. Set death before me, and you will see. Set before me pain, prison,
disgrace and condemnation." This is the proper display of a young man who is
come out of the schools. But leave the rest to others, and let no one ever hear
you say a word about these things; and if any man commends you for them, do not
allow it; but think that you are nobody and know nothing. Only show that you
know this, how never to be disappointed in your desire and how never to fall
into that which you would avoid. Let others labour at forensic causes, problems
and syllogisms: do you labour at thinking about death, chains, the rack, exile;
and do all this with confidence and reliance on him who has called you to these
sufferings, who has judged you worthy of the place in which, being stationed,
you will show what things the rational governing power can do when it takes its
stand against the forces which are not within the power of our will. And thus
this paradox will no longer appear either impossible or a paradox, that a man
ought to be at the same time cautious and courageous: courageous toward the
things which do not depend on the will, and cautious in things which are within
the power of the will.

Chapter 2

Of Tranquillity

    Consider, you who are going into court, what you wish to maintain and what
you wish to succeed in. For if you wish to maintain a will conformable to
nature, you have every security, every facility, you have no troubles. For if
you wish to maintain what is in your own power and is naturally free, and if
you are content with these, what else do you care for? For who is the master of
such things? Who can take them away? If you choose to be modest and faithful,
who shall not allow you to be so? If you choose not to be restrained or
compelled, who shall compel you to desire what you think that you ought not to
desire? who shall compel you to avoid what you do not think fit to avoid? But
what do you say? The judge will determine against you something that appears
formidable; but that you should also suffer in trying to avoid it, how can he
do that? When then the pursuit of objects and the avoiding of them are in your
power, what else do you care for? Let this be your preface, this your
narrative, this your confirmation, this your victory, this your peroration,
this your applause.
    Therefore Socrates said to one who was reminding him to prepare for his
trial, "Do you not think then that I have been preparing for it all my life?"
By what kind of preparation? "I have maintained that which was in my own
power." How then? "I have never done anything unjust either in my private or in
my public life."
    But if you wish to maintain externals also, your poor body, your little
property and your little estimation, I advise you to make from this moment all
possible preparation, and then consider both the nature of your judge and your
adversary. If it is necessary to embrace his knees, embrace his knees; if to
weep, weep; if to groan, groan. For when you have subjected to externals what
is your own, then be a slave and do not resist, and do not sometimes choose to
be a slave, and sometimes not choose, but with all your mind be one or the
other, either free or a slave, either instructed or uninstructed, either a
well-bred cock or a mean one, either endure to be beaten until you die or yield
at once; and let it not happen to you to receive many stripes and then to
yield. But if these things are base, determine immediately: "Where is the
nature of evil and good? It is where truth is: where truth is and where nature
is, there is caution: where truth is, there is courage where nature is."
    For what do you think? do you think that, if Socrates had wished to
preserve externals, he would have come forward and said: "Anytus and Meletus
can certainly kill me, but to harm me they are not able?" Was he so foolish as
not to see that this way leads not to the preservation of life and fortune, but
to another end? What is the reason then that he takes no account of his
adversaries, and even irritates them? Just in the same way my friend
Heraclitus, who had a little suit in Rhodes about a bit of land, and had proved
to the judges that his case was just, said, when he had come to the peroration
of his speech, "I will neither entreat you nor do I care what judgment you will
give, and it is you rather than I who are on your trial." And thus he ended the
business. What need was there of this? Only do not entreat; but do not also
say, "I. do not entreat"; unless there is a fit occasion to irritate purposely
the judges, as was the case with Socrates. And you, if you are preparing such a
peroration, why do you wait, why do you obey the order to submit to trial? For
if you wish to be crucified, wait and the cross will come: but if you choose to
submit and to plead your cause as well as you can, you must do what is
consistent with this object, provided you maintain what is your own.
    For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, "Suggest something to me."
What should I suggest to you? "Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itself
to any event." Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters
should say, "Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me." For if I
should tell him to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to him
not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? what will he write?
But if you behave practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anything
that is required. If you are not, what. can I now suggest? For if circumstances
require something else, what will you say or what will you do? Remember, then,
this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape after
externals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of
your master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things which
you seek to gain or try to avoid.

Chapter 3

To those who recommend persons to philosophers

    Diogenes said well to one who asked from him letters of recommendation,
"That you are a man he said, "he will know as soon as he sees you; and he will
know whether you are good or bad, if he is by experience skillful to
distinguish the good and the bad; but if he is without experience, he will
never know, if I write to him ten thousand times." For it is just the same as
if a drachma asked to be recommended to a person to be tested. If he is
skillful in testing silver, he will know what you are, for you will recommend
yourself. We ought then in life also to have some skill as in the case of
silver coin that a man may be able to say, like the judge of silver, "Bring me
any drachma and I will test it." But in the case of syllogisms I would say,
"Bring any man that you please, and I will distinguish for you the man who
knows how to resolve syllogisms and the man who does not." Why? Because I know
how to resolve syllogisms. I have the power, which a man must have who is able
to discover those who have the power of resolving syllogisms. But in life how
do I act? At one time I call a thing good, and at another time bad. What is the
reason? The contrary to that which is in the case of syllogisms, ignorance and
inexperience.

Chapter 4

Against a person who had once been detected in adultery

    As Epictetus was saying that man is formed for fidelity, and that he who
subverts fidelity subverts the peculiar characteristic of men, there entered
one of those who are considered to be men of letters, who had once been
detected in adultery in the city. Then Epictetus continued: But if we lay aside
this fidelity for which we are formed and make designs against our neighbor's
wife, what are we are we doing? What else but destroying and overthrowing?
Whom? The man of fidelity, the man of modesty, the man of sanctity. Is this
all? And are we not overthrowing neighbourhood, and friendship, and the
community; and in what place are we putting ourselves? How shall I consider
you, man? As a neighbour, as a friend? What kind of one? As a citizen? Wherein
shall I trust you? So if you were an utensil so worthless that a man could not
use you, you would be pitched out on the dung heaps, and no man would pick you
up. But if, being a man, you are unable to fill any place which befits a man,
what shall we do with you? For suppose that you cannot hold the place of a
friend, can you hold the place of a slave? And who will trust you? Are you not
then content that you also should be pitched somewhere on a dung heap, as a
useless utensil, and a bit of dung? Then will you say, "No man, cares for me, a
man of letters"? They do not, because you are bad and useless. It is just as if
the wasps complained because no man cares for them, but all fly from them, and
if a man can, he strikes them and knocks them down. You have such a sting that
you throw into trouble and pain any man that you wound with it. What would you
have us do with you? You have no place where you can be put.
    "What then, are not women common by nature?" So I say also; for a little
pig is common to all the invited guests, but when the portions have been
distributed, go, if you think it right, and snatch up the portion of him who
reclines next to you, or slyly steal it, or place your hand down by it and lay
hold of it, and if you cannot tear away a bit of the meat, grease your fingers
and lick them. A fine companion over cups, and Socratic guest indeed! "Well, is
not the theatre common to the citizens?" When then they have taken their seats,
come, if you think proper, and eject one of them. In this way women also are
common by nature. When, then, the legislator, like the master of a feast, has
distributed them, will you not also look for your own portion and not filch and
handle what belongs to another. "But I am a man of letters and understand
Archedemus." Understand Archedemus then, and be an adulterer, and faithless,
and instead of a man, be a wolf or an ape: for what is the difference?

Chapter 5

How magnanimity is consistent with care

    Things themselves are indifferent; but the use of them is not indifferent.
How then shall a man preserve firmness and tranquillity, and at the same time
be careful and neither rash nor negligent? If he imitates those who play at
dice. The counters are indifferent; the dice are indifferent. How do I know
what the cast will be? But to use carefully and dexterously the cast of the
dice, this is my business. Thus in life also the chief business is this:
distinguish and separate things, and say, "Externals are not in my power: will
is in my power. Where shall I seek the good and the bad? Within, in the things
which are my own." But in what does not belong to you call nothing either good
or bad, or profit or damage or anything of the kind.
    "What then? Should we use such things carelessly?" In no way: for this on
the other hand is bad for the faculty of the will, and consequently against
nature; but we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent and we
should also act with firmness and freedom from perturbations because the
material is indifferent. For where the material is not indifferent, there no
man can hinder me nor compel me. Where I can be hindered and compelled the
obtaining of those things is not in my power, nor is it good or bad; but the
use is either bad or good, and the use is in my power. But it is difficult to
mingle and to bring together these two things, the carefulness of him who is
affected by the matter and the firmness of him who has no regard for it; but it
is not impossible; and if it is, happiness is impossible. But we should act as
we do in the case of a voyage. What can I do? I can choose the master of the
ship, the sailors, the day, the opportunity. Then comes a storm. What more have
I to care for? for my part is done. The business belongs to another- the
master. But the ship is sinking- what then have I to do? I do the only things
that I can, not to be drowned full of fear, nor screaming, nor blaming God, but
knowing that what has been produced must also perish: for I am not an immortal
being, but a man, a part of the whole, as an hour is a part of the day: I must
be present like the hour, and past like the hour. What difference, then, does
it make to me how I pass away, whether by being suffocated or by a fever, for I
must pass through some such means?
    This is just what you will see those doing who play at ball skillfully. No
one cares about the ball being good or bad, but about throwing and catching it.
In this therefore is the skill, this the art, the quickness, the judgement, so
that if I spread out my lap I may not be able to catch it, and another, if I
throw, may catch the ball. But if with perturbation and fear we receive or
throw the ball, what kind of play is it then, and wherein shall a man be
steady, and how shall a man see the order in the game? But one will say,
"Throw"; or, "Do not throw"; and another will say, "You have thrown once." This
is quarreling, not play.
    Socrates, then, knew how to play at ball. How?" By using pleasantry in the
court where he was tried. "Tell me," he says, "Anytus, how do you say that I do
not believe in God. The Demons, who are they, think you? Are they not sons of
Gods, or compounded of gods and men?" When Anytus admitted this, Socrates said,
"Who then, think you, can believe that there are mules, but not asses"; and
this he said as if he were playing at ball. And what was the ball in that case?
Life, chains, banishment, a draught of poison, separation from wife and leaving
children orphans. These were the things with which he was playing; but still he
did play and threw the ball skillfully. So we should do: we must employ all the
care of the players, but show the same indifference about the ball. For we
ought by all means to apply our art to some external material, not as valuing
the material, but, whatever it may be, showing our art in it. Thus too the
weaver does not make wool, but exercises his art upon such as he receives.
Another gives you food and property and is able to take them away and your poor
body also. When then you have received the material, work on it. If then you
come out without having suffered anything, all who meet you will congratulate
you on your escape; but he who knows how to look at such things, if he shall
see that you have behaved properly in the matter, will commend you and be
pleased with you; and if he shall find that you owe your escape to any want of
proper behavior, he will do the contrary. For where rejoicing is reasonable,
there also is congratulation reasonable.
    How then is it said that some external things are according to nature and
others contrary to nature? It is said as it might be said if we were separated
from union: for to the foot I shall say that it is according to nature for it
to be clean; but if you take it as a foot and as a thing not detached, it will
befit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorns, and sometimes to be cut
off for the benefit of the whole body; otherwise it is no longer a foot. We
should think in some way about ourselves also. What are you? A man. If you
consider yourself as detached from other men, it is according to nature to live
to old age, to be rich, to be healthy. But if you consider yourself as a man
and a part of a certain whole, it is for the sake of that whole that at one
time you should be sick, at another time take a voyage and run into danger, and
at another time be in want, and, in some cases, die prematurely. Why then are
you troubled? Do you not know, that as a foot is no longer a foot if it is
detached from the body, so you are no longer a man if you are separated from
other men. For what is a man? A part of a state, of that first which consists
of Gods and of men; then of that which is called next to it, which is a small
image of the universal state. "What then must I be brought to trial; must
another have a fever, another sail on the sea, another die, and another be
condemned?" Yes, for it is impossible in such a body, in such a universe of
things, among so many living together, that such things should not happen, some
to one and others to others. It is your duty then, since you are come here, to
say what you ought, to arrange these things as it is fit. Then some one says,
"I shall charge you with doing me wrong." Much good may it do you: I have done
my part; but whether you also have done yours, you must look to that; for there
is some danger of this too, that it may escape your notice.

Chapter 6

Of indifference

    The hypothetical proposition is indifferent: the judgment about it is not
indifferent, but it is either knowledge or opinion or error. Thus life is
indifferent: the use is not indifferent. When any man then tells you that these
things also are indifferent, do not become negligent; and when a man invites
you to be careful, do not become abject and struck with admiration of material
things. And it is good for you to know your own preparation and power, that in
those matters where you have not been prepared, you may keep quiet, and not be
vexed, if others have the advantage over you. For you, too, in syllogisms will
claim to have the advantage over them; and if others should be vexed at this,
you will console them by saying, "I have learned them, and you have not." Thus
also where there is need of any practice, seek not that which is required from
the need, but yield in that matter to those who have had practice, and be
yourself content with firmness of mind.
    Go and salute a certain person. "How?" Not meanly. "But I have been shut
out, for I have not learned to make my way through the window; and when I have
found the door shut, I must either come back or enter through the window." But
still speak to him. "In what way?" Not meanly. But suppose that you have not
got what you wanted. Was this your business, and not his? Why then do you claim
that which belongs to another? Always remember what is your own, and what
belongs to another; and you will not be disturbed. Chrysippus therefore said
well, "So long as future things are uncertain, I always cling to those which
are more adapted to the conservation of that which is according to nature; for
God himself has given me the faculty of such choice." But if I knew that it was
fated for me to be sick, I would even move toward it; for the foot also, if it
had intelligence, would move to go into the mud. For why are ears of corn
produced? Is it not that they may become dry? And do they not become dry that
they may be reaped? for they are not separated from communion with other
things. If then they had perception, ought they to wish never to be reaped? But
this is a curse upon ears of corn, never to be reaped. So we must know that in
the case of men too it is a curse not to die, just the same as not to be
ripened and not to be reaped. But since we must be reaped, and we also know
that we are reaped, we are vexed at it; for we neither know what we are nor
have we studied what belongs to man, as those who have studied horses know what
belongs to horses. But Chrysantas, when he was going to strike the enemy,
checked himself when he heard the trumpet sounding a retreat: so it seemed
better to him to obey the general's command than to follow his own inclination.
But not one of us chooses, even when necessity summons, readily to obey it, but
weeping and groaning we suffer what we do suffer, and we call them
"circumstances." What kind of circumstances, man? If you give the name of
circumstances to the things which are around you, all things are circumstances;
but if you call hardships by this name, what hardship is there in the dying of
that which has been produced? But that which destroys is either a sword, or a
wheel, or the sea, or a tile, or a tyrant. Why do you care about the way of
going down to Hades? All ways are equal. But if you will listen to the truth,
the way which the tyrant sends you is shorter. A tyrant never killed a man in
six months: but a fever is often a year about it. All these things are only
sound and the noise of empty names.
    "I am in danger of my life from Caesar." And am not I in danger who dwell
in Nicopolis, where there are so many earthquakes: and when you are crossing
the Hadriatic, what hazard do you run? Is it not the hazard of your life? "But
I am in danger also as to opinion." Do you mean your own? how? For who can
compel you to have any opinion which you do not choose? But is it as to another
man's opinion? and what kind of danger is yours, if others have false opinions?
"But I am in danger of being banished." What is it to be banished? To be
somewhere else than at Rome? "Yes: what then if I should be sent to Gyara?" If
that suits you, you will go there; but if it does not, you can go to another
place instead of Gyara, whither he also will go, who sends you to Gyara,
whether he choose or not. Why then do you go up to Rome as if it were something
great? It is not worth all this preparation, that an ingenuous youth should
say, "It was not worth while to have heard so much and to have written so much
and to have sat so long by the side of an old man who is not worth much." Only
remember that division by which your own and not your own are distinguished:
never claim anything which belongs to others. A tribunal and a prison are each
a place, one high and the other low; but the will can be maintained equal, if
you choose to maintain it equal in each. And we shall then be imitators of
Socrates, when we are able to write paeans in prison. But in our present
disposition, consider if we could endure in prison another person saying to us.
"Would you like me to read Paeans to you?" "Why do you trouble me? do you not
know the evils which hold me? Can I in such circumstances?" What circumstances?
"I am going to die." And will other men be immortal?

Chapter 7

How we ought to use divination

    Through an unreasonable regard to divination many of us omit many duties.
For what more can the diviner see than death or danger or disease, generally
things of that kind? If then I must expose myself to danger for a friend, and
if it is my duty even to die for him, what need have I then for divination?
Have I not within me a diviner who has told me the nature of good and of evil,
and has explained to me the signs of both? What need have I then to consult the
viscera of victims or the flight of birds, and why do I submit when he says,
"It is for your interest"? For does he know what is for my interest, does he
know what is good; and as he has learned the signs of the viscera, has he also
learned the signs of good and evil? For if he knows the signs of these, he
knows the signs both of the beautiful and of the ugly, and of the just and of
the unjust. Do you tell me, man, what is the thing which is signified for me:
is it life or death, poverty or wealth? But whether these things are for my
interest or whether they are not, I do not intend to ask you. Why don't you
give your opinion on matters of grammar, and why do you give it here about
things on which we are all in error and disputing with one another? The woman,
therefore, who intended to send by a vessel a month's provisions to Gratilla in
her banishment, made a good answer to him who said that Domitian would seize
what she sent. "I would rather," she replied, "that Domitian should seize all
than that I should not send it."
    What then leads us to frequent use of divination? Cowardice, the dread of
what will happen. This is the reason why we flatter the diviners. "Pray,
master, shall I succeed to the property of my father?" "Let us see: let us
sacrifice on the occasion." "Yes, master, as fortune chooses." When he has
said, "You shall succeed to the inheritance," we thank him as if we received
the inheritance from him. The consequence is that they play upon us.
    What then should we do? We ought to come without desire or aversion, as the
wayfarer asks of the man whom he meets which of two roads leads (to his
journey's end), without any desire for that which leads to the right rather
than to the left, for he has no wish to go by any road except the road which
leads (to his end). In the same way ought we to come to God also as a guide; as
we use our eyes, not asking them to show us rather such things as we wish, but
receiving the appearances of things such as the eyes present them to us. But
now we trembling take the augur by the hand, and, while we invoke God, we
entreat the augur, and say, "Master have mercy on me; suffer me to come safe
out of this difficulty." Wretch would you have, then, anything other than what
is best? Is there then anything better than what pleases God? Why do you, so
far as in your power, corrupt your judge and lead astray your adviser?

Chapter 8

What is the nature of the good

    God is beneficial. But the Good also is beneficial. It is consistent then
that where the nature of God is, there also the nature of the good should be.
What then is the nature of God? Flesh? Certainly not. An estate in land? By no
means. Fame? No. Is it intelligence, knowledge, right reason? Yes. Herein then
simply seek the nature of the good; for I suppose that you do not seek it in a
plant. No. Do you seek it in an irrational animal? No. If then you seek it in a
rational animal, why do you still seek it anywhere except in the superiority of
rational over irrational animals? Now plants have not even the power of using
appearances, and for this reason you do not apply the term good to them. The
good then requires the use of appearances. Does it require this use only? For
if you say that it requires this use only, say that the good, and that
happiness and unhappiness are in irrational animals also. But you do not say
this, and you do right; for if they possess even in the highest degree the use
of appearances, yet they have not the faculty of understanding the use of
appearances; and there is good reason for this, for they exist for the purpose
of serving others, and they exercise no superiority. For the ass, I suppose,
does not exist for any superiority over others. No; but because we had need of
a back which is able to bear something; and in truth we had need also of his
being able to walk, and for this reason he received also the faculty of making
use of appearances, for otherwise he would not have been able to walk. And here
then the matter stopped. For if he had also received the faculty of
comprehending the use of appearances, it is plain that consistently with reason
he would not then have been subjected to us, nor would he have done us these
services, but he would have been equal to us and like to us.
    Will you not then seek the nature of good in the rational animal? for if it
is not there, you not choose to say that it exists in any other thing. "What
then? are not plants and animals also the works of God?" They are; but they are
not superior things, nor yet parts of the Gods. But you are a superior thing;
you are a portion separated from the deity; you have in yourself a certain
portion of him. Why then are you ignorant of your own noble descent? Why do you
not know whence you came? will you not remember when you are eating, who you
are who eat and whom you feed? When you are in conjunction with a woman, will
you not remember who you are who do this thing? When you are in social
intercourse, when you are exercising yourself, when you are engaged in
discussion, know you not that you are nourishing a god, that you are exercising
a god? Wretch, you are carrying about a god with you, and you know it not. Do
you think that I mean some God of silver or of gold, and external? You carry
him within yourself, and you perceive not that you are polluting him by impure
thoughts and dirty deeds. And if an image of God were present, you would not
dare to do any of the things which you are doing: but when God himself is
present within and sees all and hears all, you are not ashamed of thinking such
things and doing such things, ignorant as you are of your own nature and
subject to the anger of God. Then why do we fear when we are sending a young
man from the school into active life, lest he should do anything improperly,
eat improperly, have improper intercourse with women; and lest the rags in
which he is wrapped should debase him, lest fine garments should make him
proud? This youth does not know his own God: he knows not with whom he sets
out. But can we endure when he says, "I wish I had you with me." Have you not
God with you? and do you seek for any other, when you have him? or will God
tell you anything else than this? If you were a statue of Phidias, either
Athena or Zeus you would think broth of yourself and of the artist, and if you
had any understanding you would try to do nothing unworthy of him who made you
or of yourself, and try not to appear in an unbecoming dress to those who look
on you. But now because Zeus has made you, for this reason do you care not how
you shall appear? And yet is the artist like the artist in the other? or the
work in the one case like the other? And what work of an artist, for instance,
has in itself the faculties, which the artist shows in making it? Is it not
marble or bronze, or gold or ivory? and the Athena of Phidias when she has once
extended the hand and received in it the figure of Victory stands in that
attitude forever. But the works of God have power of motion, they breathe, they
have the faculty of using the appearances of things, and the power of examining
them. Being the work of such an artist, do you dishonor him? And what shall I
say, not only that he made you, but also intrusted you to yourself and made you
a deposit to yourself? Will you not think of this too, but do you also dishonor
your guardianship? But if God had intrusted an orphan to you, would you thus
neglect him? He has delivered yourself to your care, and says, "I had no one
fitter to intrust him to than yourself: keep him for me such as he is by
nature, modest, faithful, erect, unterrified, free from passion and
perturbation." And then you do not keep him such.
    But some will say, "Whence has this fellow got the arrogance which he
displays and these supercilious looks?" I have not yet so much gravity as
befits a philosopher; for I do not yet feel confidence in what I have learned
and what I have assented to: I still fear my own weakness. Let me get
confidence and the, you shall see a countenance such as I ought to have and an
attitude such as I ought to have: then I will show to you the statue, when it
is perfected, when it is polished. What do you expect? a supercilious
countenance? Does the Zeus at Olympia lift up his brow? No, his look is fixed
as becomes him who is ready to say
       Irrevocable is my word and shall not fail.
Such will I show myself to you, faithful, modest, noble, free from
perturbation. "What, and immortal too, exempt from old age, and from sickness?"
No, but dying as becomes a god, sickening as becomes a god. This power I
possess; this I can do. But the rest I do not possess, nor can I do. I will
show the nerves of a philosopher. "What nerves are these?" A desire never
disappointed, an aversion which never falls on that which it would avoid, a
proper pursuit, a diligent purpose, an assent which is not rash. These you
shall see.

Chapter 9

That when we cannot fulfill that which the character of a man promises, we
                     assume the character of a philosopher

    It is no common thing to do this only, to fulfill the promise of a man's
nature. For what is a man? The answer is: "A rational and mortal being." Then,
by the rational faculty, from whom are we separated? From wild beasts. And from
what others? From sheep and like animals. Take care then to do nothing like a
wild beast; but if you do, you have lost the character of a man; you have not
fulfilled your promise. See that you do nothing like a sheep; but if you do, in
this case the man is lost. What then do we do as sheep? When we act
gluttonously, when we act lewdly, when we act rashly, filthily,
inconsiderately, to what have we declined? To sheep. What have we lost? The
rational faculty. When we act contentiously and harmfully and passionately, and
violently, to what have we declined? To wild beasts. Consequently some of us
are great wild beasts, and others little beasts, of a bad disposition and
small, whence we may say, "Let me be eaten by a lion." But in all these ways
the promise of a man acting as a man is destroyed. For when is a conjunctive
proposition maintained? When it fulfills what its nature promises; so that the
preservation of a complex proposition is when it is a conjunction of truths.
When is a disjunctive maintained? When it fulfills what it promises. When are
flutes, a lyre, a horse, a dog, preserved? What is the wonder then if man also
in like manner is preserved, and in like manner is lost? Each man is improved
and preserved by corresponding acts, the carpenter by acts of carpentry, the
grammarian by acts of grammar. But if a man accustoms himself to write
ungrammatically, of necessity his art will be corrupted and destroyed. Thus
modest actions preserve the modest man, and immodest actions destroy him: and
actions of fidelity preserve the faithful man, and the contrary actions destroy
him. And on the other hand contrary actions strengthen contrary characters:
shamelessness strengthens the shameless man, faithlessness the faithless man,
abusive words the abusive man, anger the man of an angry temper, and unequal
receiving and giving make the avaricious man more avaricious.
    For this reason philosophers admonish us not to be satisfied with learning
only, but also to add study, and then practice. For we have long been
accustomed to do contrary things, and we put in practice opinions which are
contrary to true opinions. If then we shall not also put in practice right
opinions, we shall be nothing more than the expositors of the opinions of
others. For now who among us is not able to discuss according to the rules of
art about good and evil things? "That of things some are good, and some are
bad, and some are indifferent: the good then are virtues, and the things which
participate in virtues; and the are the contrary; and the indifferent are
wealth, health, reputation." Then, if in the midst of our talk there should
happen some greater noise than usual, or some of those who are present should
laugh at us, we are disturbed. Philosopher, where are the things which you were
talking about? Whence did you produce and utter them? From the lips, and thence
only. Why then do you corrupt the aids provided by others? Why do you treat the
weightiest matters as if you were playing a game of dice? For it is one thing
to lay up bread and wine as in a storehouse, and another thing to eat. That
which has been eaten, is digested, distributed, and is become sinews, flesh,
bones, blood, healthy colour, healthy breath. Whatever is stored up, when you
choose you can readily take and show it; but you have no other advantage from
it except so far as to appear to possess it. For what is the difference between
explaining these doctrines and those of men who have different opinions? Sit
down now and explain according to the rules of art the opinions of Epicurus,
and perhaps you will explain his opinions in a more useful manner than Epicurus
himself. Why then do you call yourself a Stoic? Why do you deceive the many?
Why do you deceive the many? Why do you act the part of a Jew, when you are a
Greek? Do you not see how each is called a Jew, or a Syrian or an Egyptian? and
when we see a man inclining to two sides, we are accustomed to say, "This man
is not a Jew, but he acts as one." But when he has assumed the affects of one
who has been imbued with Jewish doctrine and has adopted that sect, then he is
in fact and he is named a Jew. Thus we too being falsely imbued, are in name
Jews, but in fact we are something else. Our affects are inconsistent with our
words; we are far from practicing what we say, and that of which we are proud,
as if we knew it. Thus being, unable to fulfill even what the character of a
man promises, we even add to it the profession of a philosopher, which is as
heavy a burden, as if a man who is unable to bear ten pounds should attempt to
raise the stone which Ajax lifted.

Chapter 10

How we may discover the duties of life from names

    Consider who you are. In the first place, you are a man; and this is one
who has nothing superior to the faculty of the will, but all other things
subjected to it; and the faculty itself he possesses unenslaved and free from
subjection. Consider then from what things you have been separated by reason.
You have been separated from wild beasts: you have been separated from domestic
animals. Further, you are a citizen of the world, and a part of it, not one of
the subservient, but one of the principal parts, for you are capable of
comprehending the divine administration and of considering the connection of
things. What then does the character of a citizen promise? To hold nothing as
profitable to himself; to deliberate about nothing as if he were detached from
the community, but to act as the hand or foot would do, if they had reason and
understood the constitution of nature, for they would never put themselves in
motion nor desire anything, otherwise than with reference to the whole.
Therefore the philosophers say well, that if the good man had foreknowledge of
what would happen, he would cooperate toward his own sickness and death and
mutilation, since he knows that these things are assigned to him according to
the universal arrangement, and that the whole is superior to the part and the
state to the citizen. But now, because we do not know the future, it is our
duty to stick to the things which are in their nature more suitable for our
choice, for we were made among other things for this.
    After this, remember that you are a son. What does this character promise?
To consider that everything which is the son's belongs to the father, to obey
him in all things, never to blame him to another, nor to say or do anything
which does him injury, to yield to him in all things and give way, cooperating
with him as far as you can. After this know that you are a brother also, and
that to this character it is due to make concessions; to be easily persuaded,
to speak good of your brother, never to claim in opposition to him any of the
things which are independent of the will, but readily to give them up, that you
may have the larger share in what is dependent on the will. For see what a
thing it is, in place of a lettuce, if it should so happen, or a seat, to gain
for yourself goodness of disposition. How great is the advantage.
    Next to this, if you are senator of any state, remember that you are a
senator: if a youth, that you are a youth: if an old man, that you are an old
man; for each of such names, if it comes to be examined, marks out the proper
duties. But if you go and blame your brother, I say to you, "You have forgotten
who you are and what is your name." In the next place, if you were a smith and
made a wrong use of the hammer, you would have forgotten the smith; and if you
have forgotten the brother and instead of a brother have become an enemy, would
you appear not to have changed one thing for another in that case? And if
instead of a man, who is a tame animal and social, you are become a mischievous
wild beast, treacherous, and biting, have you lost nothing? But, you must lose
a bit of money that you may suffer damage? And does the loss of nothing else do
a man damage? If you had lost the art of grammar or music, would you think the
loss of it a damage? and if you shall lose modesty, moderation and gentleness,
do you think the loss nothing? And yet the things first mentioned are lost by
some cause external and independent of the will, and the second by our own
fault; and as to the first neither to have them nor to lose them is shameful;
but as to the second, not to have them and to lose them is shameful and matter
of reproach and a misfortune. What does the pathic lose? He loses the man. What
does he lose who makes the pathic what he is? Many other things; and he also
loses the man no less than the other. What does he lose who commits adultery?
He loses the modest, the temperate, the decent, the citizen, the neighbour.
What does he lose who is angry? Something else. What does the coward lose?
Something else. No man is bad without suffering some loss and damage. If then
you look for the damage in the loss of money only, all these men receive no
harm or damage; it may be, they have even profit and gain, when they acquire a
bit of money by any of these deeds. But consider that if you refer everything
to a small coin, not even he who loses his nose is in your opinion damaged.
"Yes," you say, "for he is mutilated in his body." Well; but does he who has
lost his smell only lose nothing? Is there, then, no energy of the soul which
is an advantage to him who possesses it, and a damage to him who has lost it?
"Tell me what sort you mean." Have we not a natural modesty? "We have." Does he
who loses this sustain no damage? is he deprived of nothing, does he part with
nothing of the things which belong to him? Have we not naturally fidelity?
natural affection, a natural disposition to help others, a natural disposition
to forbearance? The man then who allows himself to be damaged in these matters,
can he be free from harm and uninjured? "What then? shall I not hurt him, who
has hurt me?" In the first place consider what hurt is, and remember what you
have heard from the philosophers. For if the good consists in the will, and the
evil also in the will, see if what you say is not this: "What then, since that
man has hurt himself by doing an unjust act to me, shall I not hurt myself by
doing some unjust act to him?" Why do we not imagine to something of this kind?
But where there is any detriment to the body or to our possession, there is
harm there; and where the same thing happens to the faculty of the will, there
is no harm; for he who has been deceived or he who has done an unjust act
neither suffers in the head nor in the eye nor in the hip, nor does he lose his
estate; and we wish for nothing else than these things. But whether we shall
have the will modest and faithful or shameless and faithless, we care not the
least, except only in the school so far as a few words are concerned. Therefore
our proficiency is limited to these few words; but beyond them it does not
exist even in the slightest degree.

Chapter 11

What the beginning of philosophy is

    The beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters on it in the right
way and by the door, is a consciousness of his own weakness and inability about
necessary things. For we come into the world with no natural notion of a
right-angled triangle, or of a diesis, or of a half tone; but we learn each of
these things by a certain transmission according to art; and for this reason
those who do not know them, do not think that they know them. But as to good
and evil, and beautiful and ugly, and becoming and unbecoming, and happiness
and misfortune, and proper and improper, and what we ought to do and what we
ought not to do, whoever came into the world without having an innate idea of
them? Wherefore we all use these names, and we endeavor to fit the
preconceptions to the several cases thus: "He has done well, he has not done
well; he has done as he ought, not as he ought; he has been unfortunate, he has
been fortunate; he is unjust, he is just": who does not use these names? who
among us defers the use of them till he has learned them, as he defers the use
of the words about lines or sounds? And the cause of this is that we come into
the world already taught as it were by nature some things on this matter, and
proceeding from these we have added to them self-conceit. "For why," a man
says, "do I not know the beautiful and the ugly? Have I not the notion of it?"
You have. "Do I not adapt it to particulars?" You do. "Do I not then adapt it
properly?" In that lies the whole question; and conceit is added here. For,
beginning from these things which are admitted, men proceed to that which is
matter of dispute by means of unsuitable adaptation; for if they possessed this
power of adaptation in addition to those things, what would hinder them from
being perfect? But now since you think that you properly adapt the
preconceptions to the particulars, tell me whence you derive this. Because I
think so. But it does not seem so to another, and he thinks that he also makes
a proper adaptation; or does he not think so? He does think so. Is it possible
then that both of you can properly apply the preconceptions to things about
which you have contrary opinions? It is not possible. Can you then show us
anything better toward adapting the preconceptions beyond your thinking that
you do? Does the madman do any other things than the things as in which seem to
him right? Is then this criterion for him also? It is not sufficient. Come then
to something which is superior to seeming. What is this?
    Observe, this is the beginning of philosophy, a perception of the
disagreement of men with one another, and an inquiry into the cause of the
disagreement, and a condemnation and distrust of that which only "seems," and a
certain investigation of that which "seems" whether it "seems" rightly, and a
discovery of some rule, as we have discovered a balance in the determination of
weights, and a carpenter's rule in the case of straight and crooked things.
This is the beginning of philosophy. "Must we say that all thins are right
which seem so to all?" And how is it possible that contradictions can be right?
"Not all then, but all which seem to us to be right." How more to you than
those which seem right to the Syrians? why more than what seem right to the
Egyptians? why more than what seems right to me or to any other man? "Not at
all more." What then "seems" to every man is not sufficient for determining
what "is"; for neither in the case of weights or measures are we satisfied with
the bare appearance, but in each case we have discovered a certain rule. In
this matter then is there no rule certain to what "seems?" And how is it
possible that the most necessary things among men should have no sign, and be
incapable of being discovered? There is then some rule. And why then do we not
seek the rule and discover it, and afterward use it without varying from it,
not even stretching out the finger without it? For this, I think, is that which
when it is discovered cures of their madness those who use mere "seeming" as a
measure, and misuse it; so that for the future proceeding from certain things
known and made clear we may use in the case of particular things the
preconceptions which are distinctly fixed.
    What is the matter presented to us about which we are inquiring?
"Pleasure." Subject it to the rule, throw it into the balance. Ought the good
to be such a thing that it is fit that we have confidence in it? "Yes." And in
which we ought to confide? "It ought to be." Is it fit to trust to anything
which is insecure? "No." Is then pleasure anything secure? "No." Take it then
and throw it out of the scale, and drive it far away from the place of good
things. But if you are not sharp-sighted, and one balance is not enough for
you, bring another. Is it fit to be elated over what is good? "Yes." Is it
proper then to be elated over present pleasure? See that you do not say that it
is proper; but if you do, I shall then not think you are worthy even of the
balance. Thus things are tested and weighed when the rules are ready. And to
philosophize is this, to examine and confirm the rules; and then to use them
when they are known is the act of a wise and good man.

Chapter 12

Of disputation or discussion

    What things a man must learn in order to be able to apply the art of
disputation, has been accurately shown by our philosophers; but with respect to
the proper use of the things, we are entirely without practice. Only give to
any of us, whom you please, an illiterate man to discuss with,, and he cannot
discover how to deal with the man. But when he has moved the man a little, if
he answers beside the purpose, he does not know how to treat him, but he then
either abuses or ridicules him, and says, "He is an illiterate man; it is not
possible to do anything with him." Now a guide, when he has found a man out of
the road leads him into the right way: he does not ridicule or abuse him and
then leave him. Do you also show this illiterate man the truth, and you will
see that he follows. But so long as you do not show him the truth, do not
ridicule him, but rather feel your own incapacity.
    How then did Socrates act? He used to compel his adversary in disputation
to bear testimony to him, and he wanted no other witness. Therefore he could
say, "I care not for other witnesses, but I am always satisfied with the
evidence of my adversary, and I do not ask the opinion of others, but only the
opinion of him who is disputing with me." For he used to make the conclusions
drawn from natural notions so plain that every man saw the contradiction and
withdrew from it: "Does the envious man rejoice?" "By no means, but he is
rather pained." Well, "Do you think that envy is pain over evils? and what envy
is there of evils?" Therefore he made his adversary say that envy is pain over
good things. "Well then, would any man envy those who are nothing to him?" "By
no means." Thus having completed the notion and distinctly fixed it he would go
away without saying to his adversary, "Define to me envy"; and if the adversary
had defined envy, he did not say, "You have defined it badly, for the terms of
the definition do not correspond to the thing defined." These are technical
terms, and for this reason disagreeable and hardly intelligible to illiterate
men, which terms we cannot lay aside. But that the illiterate man himself, who
follows the appearances presented to him, should be able to concede anything or
reject it, we can never by the use of these terms move him to do. Accordingly,
being conscious of our own inability, we do not attempt the thing; at least
such of us as have any caution do not. But the greater part and the rash, when
they enter into such disputations, confuse themselves and confuse others; and
finally abusing their adversaries and abused by them, they walk away.
    Now this was the first and chief peculiarity of Socrates, never to be
irritated in argument, never to utter anything abusive, anything insulting, but
to bear with abusive persons and to put an end to the quarrel. If you would
know what great power he had in this way, read the Symposium of Xenophon, and
you will see how many quarrels he put an end to. Hence with good reason in the
poets also this power is most highly praised,
       Quickly with the skill he settles great disputes.
    Well then; the matter is not now very safe, and particularly at Rome; for
he who attempts to do it, must not do it in a corner, you may be sure, but must
go to a man of consular rank, if it so happen, or to a rich man, and ask him,
"Can you tell me, Sir, to whose care you have entrusted your horses?" "I can
tell you." Here you entrusted them to a person indifferently and to one who has
no experience of horses? "By no means." Well then; can you tell me to whom you
entrust your gold or silver things or your vestments? "I don't entrust even
these to anyone indifferently." Well; your own body, have you already
considered about entrusting the care of it to any person? "Certainly." To a man
of experience, I suppose, and one acquainted with the aliptic, or with the
healing art? "Without a doubt." Are these the best things that you have, or do
you also possess something else which is better than all these? "What kind of
thing do you mean?" That I mean which makes use of these things, and tests each
of these things and deliberates. "Is it the soul that you mean?" You think
right, for it is the soul that I mean. "In truth I do think the soul is a much
better thing than all the others which I possess." Can you then show us in what
way you have taken care of the soul? for it is not likely that you, who are so
wise a man and have a reputation in the city, inconsiderately and carelessly
allow the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected and to perish?
"Certainly not." But have you taken care of the soul yourself; and have you
learned from another to do this, or have you discovered the means yourself?
Here comes the danger that in the first place he may say, "What is this to you,
my good man, who are you?" Next, if you persist in troubling him, there is a
danger that he may raise his hands and give you blows. I was once myself also
an admirer of this mode of instruction until I fell into these dangers.

Chapter 13

On anxiety

    When I see a man anxious, I say, "What does this man want? If he did not
want something which is not in his power, how could he be anxious?" For this
reason a lute player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety, but when he
enters the theatre, he is anxious even if he has a good voice and plays well on
the lute; for he not only wishes to sing well, but also to obtain applause: but
this is not in his power. Accordingly, where he has skill, there he has
confidence. Bring any single person who knows nothing of music, and the
musician does not care for him. But in the matter where a man knows nothing and
has not been practiced, there he is anxious. What matter is this? He knows not
what a crowd is or what the praise of a crowd is. However he has learned to
strike the lowest chord and the highest; but what the praise of the many is,
and what power it has in life he neither knows nor has he thought about it.
Hence he must of necessity tremble and grow pale. I cannot then say that a man
is not a lute player when I see him afraid, but I can say something else, and
not one thing, but many. And first of all I call him a stranger and say, "This
man does not know in what part of the world he is, but though he has been here
so long, he is ignorant of the laws of the State and the customs, and what is
permitted and what is not; and he has never employed any lawyer to tell him and
to explain the laws." But a man does not write a will, if he does not does not
know how it ought to be written, or he employs a person who does know; nor does
he rashly seal a bond or write a security. But he uses his desire without a
lawyer's advice, and aversion, and pursuit, and attempt and purpose. "How do
you mean without a lawyer?" He does not know that he wills what is not allowed,
and does not will that which is of necessity; and he does not know either what
is his own or what is or what is another man's; but if he did know, he could
never be impeded, he would never be hindered, he would not be anxious. "How so?
" Is any man then afraid about things which are not evil? "No." Is he afraid
about things which are evils, but still so far within his power that they may
not happen? "Certainly he is not." If, then, the things which are independent
of the will are neither good nor bad, and all things which do depend on the
will are within our power, and no man can either take them from us or give them
to us, if we do not choose, where is room left for anxiety? But we are anxious
about our poor body, our little property, about the will of Caesar; but not
anxious about things internal. Are we anxious about not forming a false
opinion? No, for this is in my power. About not exerting our movements contrary
to nature? No, not even about this. When then you see a man pale, as the
physician says, judging from the complexion, this man's spleen is disordered,
that man's liver; so also say, this man's desire and aversion are disordered,
he is not in the right way, he is in a fever. For nothing else changes the
color, or causes trembling or chattering of the teeth, or causes a man to
       Sink in his knees and shift from foot to foot.
    For this reason when Zeno was going to meet Antigonus, he was not anxious,
for Antigonus had no power over any of the things which Zeno admired; and Zeno
did not care for those things over which Antigonus had power. But Antigonus was
anxious when he was going to meet Zeno, for he wished to please Zeno; but this
was a thing external. But Zeno did not want to please Antigonus; for no man who
is skilled in any art wishes to please one who has no such skill.
    Should I try to please you? Why? I suppose, you know the measure by which
one man is estimated by another. Have you taken pains to learn what is a good
man and what is a bad man, and how a man becomes one or the other? Why, then,
are you not good yourself? "How," he replies, "am I not good?" Because no good
man laments or roans or weeps, no good man is pale and trembles, or says, "How
will he receive me, how will he listen to me?" Slave, just as it pleases him.
Why do you care about what belongs to others? Is it now his fault if he
receives badly what proceeds from you? "Certainly." And is it possible that a
fault should be one man's, and the evil in another? "No." Why then are you
anxious about that which belongs to others? "Your question is reasonable; but I
am anxious how I shall speak to him." Cannot you then speak to him as you
choose? "But I fear that I may be disconcerted?" If you are going to write the
name of Dion, are you afraid that you would be disconcerted? "By no means."
Why? is it not because you have practiced writing the name? "Certainly." Well,
if you were going to read the name, would you not feel the same? and why?
Because every art has a certain strength and confidence in the things which
belong to it. Have you then not practiced speaking? and what else did you learn
in the school? Syllogisms and sophistical propositions? For what purpose? was
it not for the purpose of discoursing skillfully? and is not discoursing
skillfully the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously and with
intelligence, and also without making mistakes and without hindrance, and
besides all this with confidence? "Yes." When, then, you are mounted on a horse
and go into a plain, are you anxious at being matched against a man who is on
foot, and anxious in a matter in which you are practiced, and he is not? "Yes,
but that person has power to kill me." Speak the truth then, unhappy man, and
do not brag, nor claim to be a philosopher, nor refuse to acknowledge your
masters, but so long as you present this handle in your body, follow every man
who is stronger than yourself. Socrates used to practice speaking, he who
talked as he did to the tyrants, to the dicasts, he who talked in his prison.
Diogenes had practiced speaking, he who spoke as he did to Alexander, to the
pirates, to the person who bought him. These men were confident in the things
which they practiced. But do you walk off to your own affairs and never leave
them: go and sit in a corner, and weave syllogisms, and propose them to
another. There is not in you the man who can rule a state.

Chapter 14

To Naso

    When a certain Roman entered with his son and listened to one reading,
Epictetus said, "This is the method of instruction"; and he stopped. When the
Roman asked him to go on, Epictetus said: Every art, when it is taught, causes
labour to him who is unacquainted with it and is unskilled in it, and indeed
the things which proceed from the arts immediately show their use in the
purpose for which they were made; and most of them contain something attractive
and pleasing. For indeed to be present and to observe how a shoemaker learns is
not a pleasant thing; but the shoe is useful and also not disagreeable to look
at. And the discipline of a smith when he is learning is very disagreeable to
one who chances to be present and is a stranger to the art: but the work shows
the use of the art. But you will see this much more in music; for if you are
present while a person is learning, the discipline will appear most
disagreeable; and yet the results of music are pleasing and delightful to those
who know nothing of music. And here we conceive the work of a philosopher to be
something of this kind: he must adapt his wish to what is going on, so that
neither any of the things which are taking place shall take place contrary to
our wish, nor any of the things which do not take place shall not take place
when we wish that they should. From this the result is to those who have so
arranged the work of philosophy, not to fall in the desire, nor to fall in with
that which they would avoid; without uneasiness, without fear, without
perturbation to pass through life themselves, together with their associates
maintaining the relations both natural and acquired, as the relation of son, of
father, of brother, of citizen, of man, of wife, of neighbour, of
fellow-traveler, of ruler, of ruled. The work of a philosopher we conceive to
be something like this. It remains next to inquire how this must be
accomplished.
    We see then that the carpenter when he has learned certain things becomes a
carpenter; the pilot by learning certain things becomes a pilot. May it not,
then, in philosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise and good, and
that there is also a necessity to learn certain things? We inquire then what
these things are. The philosophers say that we ought first to learn that there
is a God and that he provides for all things; also that it is not possible to
conceal from him our acts, or even our intentions and thoughts. The next thing,
is to learn what is the nature of the Gods; for such as they are discovered to
be, he, who would please and obey them, must try with all his power to be like
them. If the divine is faithful, man also must be faithful; if it is free, man
also must be free; if beneficent, man also must be beneficent; if magnanimous,
man also must be magnanimous; as being, then an imitator of God, he must do and
say everything consistently with this fact.
    "With what then must we begin?" If you will enter on the discussion, I will
tell you that you must first understand names. "So, then, you say that I do not
now understand names?" You do not understand them. "How, then, do I use them?"
Just as the illiterate use written language, as cattle use appearances: for use
is one thing, understanding is another. But if you think that you understand
them, produce whatever word you please, and let us try whether we understand
it. But it is a disagreeable thing for a man to be confuted who is now old and,
it may be, has now served his three campaigns. I too know this: for now you are
come to me as if you were in want of nothing: and what could you even imagine
to be wanting to you? You are rich, you have children, and a wife, perhaps and
many slaves: Caesar knows you, in Rome you have many friends, you render their
dues to all, you know how to requite him who does you a favour, and to repay in
the same kind him who does a wrong. What do you lack? If, then, I shall show
you that you lack the things most necessary and the chief things for happiness,
and that hitherto you have looked after everything rather than what you ought,
and, to crown all, that you neither know what God is nor what man is, nor what
is good nor what is bad; and as to what I have said about your ignorance of
other matters, that may perhaps be endured, but if I say that you know nothing
about yourself, how is it possible that you should endure me and bear the proof
and stay here? It is not possible; but you immediately go off in bad humour.
And yet what harm have I done you? unless the mirror also injures the ugly man
because it shows him to himself such as he is; unless the physician also is
supposed to insult the sick man, when he says to him, "Man, do you think that
you ail nothing? But you have a fever: go without food to-day; drink water."
And no one says, "What an insult!" But if you say to a man, "Your desires are
inflamed, your aversions are low, your intentions are inconsistent, your
pursuits are not comfortable to nature, your opinions are rash and false," the
man immediately goes away and says, "he has insulted me."
    Our way of dealing is like that of a crowded assembly. Beasts are brought
to be sold and oxen; and the greater part of the men come to buy and sell, and
there are some few who come to look at the market and to inquire how it is
carried on, and why, and who fixes the meeting and for what purpose. So it is
here also in this assembly: some like cattle trouble themselves about nothing
except their fodder. For to all of you who are busy about possessions and lands
and slaves and magisterial offices, these are nothing except fodder. But there
are a few who attend the assembly, men who love to look on and consider what is
the world, who governs it. Has it no governor? And how is it possible that a
city or a family cannot continue to exist, not even the shortest time without
an administrator and guardian, and that so great and beautiful a system should
be administered with such order and yet without a purpose and by chance? There
is then an administrator. What kind of administrator and how does he govern?
And who are we, who were produced by him, and for what purpose? Have we some
connection with him and some relation toward him, or none? This is the way in
which these few are affected, and then they apply themselves only to this one
thing, to examine the meeting and then to go away. What then? They are
ridiculed by the many, as the spectators at the fair are by the traders; and if
the beasts had any understanding, they would ridicule those who admired
anything else than fodder.

Chapter 15

To or against those who obstinately persist in what they have determined

    When some persons have heard these words, that a man ought to be constant,
and that the will is naturally free and not subject to compulsion, but that all
other things are subject to hindrance, to slavery, and are in the power of
others, they suppose that they ought without deviation to abide by everything
which they have determined. But in the first place that which has been
determined ought to be sound. I require tone in the body, but such as exists in
a healthy body, in an athletic body; but if it is plain to me that you have the
tone of a frenzied man and you boast of it, I shall say to you, "Man, seek the
physician": this is not tone, but atony. In a different way something of the
same kind is felt by those who listen to these discourses in a wrong manner;
which was the case with one of my companions who for no reason resolved to
starve himself to death. I heard of it when it was the third day of his
abstinence from food and I went to inquire what had happened. "I have
resolved," he said. But still tell me what it was which induced you to resolve;
for if you have resolved rightly, we shall sit with you and assist you to
depart; but if you have made an unreasonable resolution, change your mind. "We
ought to keep to our determinations." What are you doing, man? We ought to keep
not to all our determinations, but to those which are right; for if you are now
persuaded that it is right, do not change your mind, if you think fit, but
persist and say, "We ought to abide by our determinations." Will you not make
the beginning and lay the foundation in an inquiry whether the determination is
sound or not sound, and so then build on it firmness and security? But if you
lay a rotten and ruinous foundation, will not your miserable little building
fall down the sooner, the more and the stronger are the materials which you
shall lay on it? Without any reason would you withdraw from us out of life a
man who is a friend, and a companion, a citizen of the same city, both the
great and the small city? Then, while you are committing murder and destroying
a man who has done no wrong, do you say that you ought to abide by your
determinations? And if it ever in any way came into your head to kill me, ought
you to abide by your determinations?
    Now this man was with difficulty persuaded to change his mind. But it is
impossible to convince some persons at present; so that I seem now to know,
what I did not know, before, the meaning of the common saying, "That you can
neither persuade nor break a fool." May it never be my lot to have a wise fool
for my friend: nothing is more untractable. "I am determined," the man says.
Madmen are also; but the more firmly they form a judgment on things which do
not exist, the more ellebore they require. Will you not act like a sick man and
call in the physician? "I am sick, master, help me; consider what I must do: it
is my duty to obey you." So it is here also: "I know not what I ought to do,
but I am come to learn." Not so; but, "Speak to me about other things: upon
this I have determined." What other things? for what is greater and more useful
than for you to be persuaded that it is not sufficient to have made your
determination and not to change it. This is the tone of madness, not of health.
"I will die, if you compel me to this." Why, man? What has happened? "I have
determined." I have had a lucky escape that you have not determined to kill me.
"I take no money." Why? "I have determined." Be assured that with the very tone
which you now use in refusing to take, there is nothing to hinder you at some
time from inclining without reason to take money and then saying, "I have
determined." As in a distempered body, subject to defluxions, the humor
inclines sometimes to these parts and then to those, so too a sickly soul knows
not which way to incline: but if to this inclination and movement there is
added a tone, then the evil becomes past help and cure.

Chapter 16

That we do not strive to use our opinions about good and evil

    Where is the good? In the will. Where is the evil? In the will. Where is
neither of them? In those things which are independent of the will. Well then?
Does any one among us think of these lessons out of the schools? Does any one
meditate by himself to give an answer to things as in the case of questions? Is
it day? "Yes." Is it night? "No." Well, is the number of stars even? "I cannot
say." When money is shown to you, have you studied to make the proper answer,
that money is not a good thing? Have you practiced yourself in these answers,
or only against sophisms? Why do you wonder then if in the cases which you have
studied, in those you have improved; but in those which you have not studied,
in those you remain the same? When the rhetorician knows that he has written
well, that he has committed to memory what he has written, and brings an
agreeable voice, why is he still anxious? Because he is not satisfied with
having studied. What then does he want? To be praised by the audience? For the
purpose, then, of being able to practice declamation, he has been disciplined:
but with respect to praise and blame he has not been disciplined. For when did
he hear from any one what praise is, what blame is, what the nature of each is,
what kind of praise should be sought, or what kind of blame should be shunned?
And when did he practice this discipline which follows these words? Why then do
you still wonder if, in the matters which a man has learned, there he surpasses
others, and in those in which he has not been disciplined, there he is the same
with the many. So the lute player knows how to play, sings well, and has a fine
dress, and yet he trembles when he enters on the stage; for these matters he
understands, but he does not know what a crowd is, nor the shouts of a crowd,
nor what ridicule is. Neither does he know what anxiety is, whether it is our
work or the work of another, whether it is possible to stop it or not. For this
reason, if he has been praised, he leaves the theatre puffed up, but if he has
been ridiculed, the swollen bladder has been punctured and subsides.
    This is the case also with ourselves. What do we admire? Externals. About
what things are we busy? Externals. And have we any doubt then why we fear or
why we are anxious? What, then, happens when we think the things which are
coming on us to be evils? It is not in our power not to be afraid, it is not in
our power not to be anxious. Then we say, "Lord God, how shall I not be
anxious?" Fool, have you not hands, did not God make them for you, Sit down now
and pray that your nose may not run. Wipe yourself rather and do not blame him.
Well then, has he given to you nothing in the present case? Has he not given to
you endurance? has he not given to you magnanimity? has he not given to you
manliness? When you have such hands, do you look for one who shall wipe your
you st nose? But we neither study these things nor care for them. Give me a man
who cares how he shall do anything, not for the obtaining of a thing but who
cares about his own energy. What man, when he is walking about, cares for his
own energy? who, when he is deliberating, cares about his own deliberation, and
not about obtaining that about which he deliberates? And if he succeeds, he is
elated and says, "How well we have deliberated; did I not tell you, brother,
that it is impossible, when we have thought about anything, that it should not
turn out thus?" But if the thing should turn out otherwise, the wretched man is
humbled; he knows not even what to say about what has taken place. Who among us
for the sake of this matter has consulted a seer? Who among us as to his
actions has not slept in indifference? Who? Give to me one that I may see the
man whom I have long been looking for, who is truly noble and ingenuous,
whether young or old; name him.
    Why then are we still surprised, if we are well practiced in thinking about
matters, but in our acts are low, without decency, worthless, cowardly,
impatient of labour, altogether bad? For we do not care about things, nor do we
study them. But if we had feared not death or banishment, but fear itself, we
should have studied not to fall into those things which appear to us evils. Now
in the school we are irritable and wordy; and if any little question arises
about any of these things, we are able to examine them fully. But drag us to
practice, and you will find us miserably shipwrecked. Let some disturbing
appearance come on us, and you will know what we have been studying and in what
we have been exercising ourselves. Consequently, through want of discipline, we
are always adding something to the appearance and representing things to be
greater than what they are. For instance as to myself, when I am on a voyage
and look down on the deep sea, or look round on it and see no land, I am out of
my mind and imagine that I must drink up all this water if I am wrecked, and it
does not occur to me that three pints are enough. What then disturbs me? The
sea? No, but my opinion. Again, when an earthquake shall happen, I imagine that
the city is going to fall on me; is not one little stone enough to knock my
brains out?
    What then are the things which are heavy on us and disturb us? What else
than opinions? What else than opinions lies heavy upon him who goes away and
leaves his companions and friends and places and habits of life? Now little
children, for instance, when they cry on the nurse leaving them for a short
time, forget their sorrow if they receive a small cake. Do you choose then that
we should compare you to little children? No, by Zeus, for I do not wish to be
pacified by a small cake, but by right opinions. And what are these? Such as a
man ought to study all day, and not to be affected by anything that is not his
own, neither by companion nor place nor gymnasia, and not even by his own body,
but to remember the law and to have it before his eyes. And what is the divine
law? To keep a man's own, not to claim that which belongs to others, but to use
what is given, and when it is not given, not to desire it; and when a thing is
taken away, to give it up readily and immediately, and to be thankful for the
time that a man has had the use of it, if you would not cry for your nurse and
mamma. For what matter does it make by what thing a man is subdued, and on what
he depends? In what respect are you better than he who cries for a girl, if you
grieve for a little gymnasium, and little porticoes and young men and such
places of amusement? Another comes and laments that he shall no longer drink
the water of Dirce. Is the Marcian water worse than that of Dirce? "But I was
used to the water of Dirce?" And you in turn will be used to the other. Then if
you become attached to this also, cry for this too, and try to make a verse
like the verse of Euripides,
       The hot baths of Nero and the Marcian water.
See how tragedy is made when common things happen to silly men.
    "When then shall I see Athens again and the Acropolis?" Wretch, are you not
content with what you see daily? have you anything better or greater to see
than the sun, the moon, the stars, the whole earth, the sea? But if indeed you
comprehend him who administers the Whole, and carry him about in yourself, do
you still desire small stones, and a beautiful rock? When, then, you are going
to leave the sun itself and the moon, what will you do? will you sit and weep
like children? Well, what have you been doing in the school? what did you hear,
what did you learn? why did you write yourself a philosopher, when you might
have written the truth; as, "I made certain introductions, and I read
Chrysippus, but I did not even approach the door of a philosopher." For how
should I possess anything of the kind which Socrates possessed, who died as he
did, who lived as he did, or anything such as Diogenes possessed? Do you think
that any one of such men wept or grieved, because he was not going to see a
certain man, or a certain woman, nor to be in Athens or in Corinth, but, if it
should so happen, in Susa or in Ecbatana? For if a man can quit the banquet
when he chooses, and no longer amuse himself, does he still stay and complain,
and does he not stay, as at any amusement, only so long as he is pleased? Such
a man, I suppose, would endure perpetual exile or to be condemned to death.
Will you not be weaned now, like children, and take more solid food, and not
cry after mammas and nurses, which are the lamentations of old women? "But if I
go away, I shall cause them sorrow." You cause them sorrow? By no means; but
that will cause them sorrow which also causes you sorrow, opinion. What have
you to do then? Take away your own opinion, and if these women are wise, they
will take away their own: if they do not, they will lament through their own
fault.
    My man, as the proverb says, make a desperate effort on behalf of
tranquillity of mind, freedom and magnanimity. Lift up your head at last as
released from slavery. Dare to look up to God and say, "Deal with me for the
future as thou wilt; I am of the same mind as thou art; I am thine: I refuse
nothing that pleases thee: lead me where thou wilt: clothe me in any dress thou
choosest: is it thy will that I should hold the office of a magistrate, that I
should be in the condition of a private man, stay there or be an exile, be
poor, be rich? I will make thy defense to men in behalf of all these
conditions. I will show the nature of each thing what it is." You will not do
so; but sit in an ox's belly, and wait for your mamma till she shall feed you.
Who would Hercules have been, if he had sat at home? He would have been
Eurystheus and not Hercules. Well, and in his travels through the world how
many intimates and how many friends had he? But nothing more dear to him than
God. For this reason it was believed that he was the son of God, and he was. In
obedience to God, then, he went about purging away injustice and lawlessness.
But you are not Hercules and you are not able to purge away the wickedness of
others; nor yet are you Theseus, able to pure away the evil things of Attica.
Clear away your own. From yourself, from your thoughts cast away, instead of
Procrustes and Sciron, sadness, fear, desire, envy, malevolence, avarice,
effeminacy, intemperance. But it is not possible to eject these things
otherwise than by looking to God only, by fixing your affections on him only,
by being consecrated to his commands. But if you choose anything else, you will
with sighs and groans be compelled to follow what is stronger than yourself,
always seeking tranquillity and never able to find it; for you seek
tranquillity there where it is not, and you neglect to seek it where it is.

Chapter 17

How we must adapt preconceptions to particular cases

    What is the first business of him who philosophizes? To throw away
self-conceit. For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn that which he
thinks that he knows. As to things then which ought to be done and ought not to
be done, and good and bad, and beautiful and ugly, all of us talking of them at
random go to the philosophers; and on these matters we praise, we censure, we
accuse, we blame, we judge and determine about principles honourable and
dishonourable. But why do we go to the philosophers? Because we wish to learn
what we do not think we know. And what is this? Theorems. For we wish to learn
what philosophers say as being something elegant and acute; and some wish to
learn that they may get profit what they learn. It is ridiculous then to think
that a person wishes to learn one thing, and will learn another; or further,
that a man will make proficiency in that which he does not learn. But the many
are deceived by this which deceived also the rhetorician Theopompus, when he
blames even Plato for wishing everything to be defined. For what does he say?
"Did none of us before you use the words 'good' or 'just,' or do we utter the
sounds in an unmeaning and empty way without understanding what they severally
signify?" Now who tells you, Theopompus, that we had not natural notions of
each of these things and preconceptions? But it is not possible to adapt
preconceptions to their correspondent objects if we have not distinguished
them, and inquired what object must be subjected to each preconception. You may
make the same charge against physicians also. For who among us did not use the
words "healthy" and "unhealthy" before Hippocrates lived, or did we utter these
words as empty sounds? For we have also a certain preconception of health, but
we are not able to adapt it. For this reason one says, "Abstain from food";
another says, "Give food"; another says, "Bleed"; and another says, "Use
cupping." What is the reason? is it any other than that a man cannot properly
adapt the preconception of health to particulars?
    So it is in this matter also, in the things which concern life. Who among
us does not speak of good and bad, of useful and not useful; for who among us
has not a preconception of each of these things? Is it then a distinct and
perfect preconception? Show this. How shall I show this? Adapt the
preconception properly to the particular things. Plato, for instance, subjects
definitions to the preconception of the useful, but you to the preconception of
the useless. Is it possible then that both of you are right? How is it
possible? Does not one man adapt the preconception of good to the matter of
wealth, and another not to wealth, but to the matter of pleasure and to that of
health? For, generally, if all of us who use those words know sufficiently each
of them, and need no diligence in resolving, the notions of the preconceptions,
why do we differ, why do we quarrel, why do we blame one another?
    And why do I now allege this contention with one another and speak of it?
If you yourself properly adapt your preconceptions, why are you unhappy, why
are you hindered? Let us omit at present the second topic about the pursuits
and the study of the duties which relate to them. Let us omit also the third
topic, which relates to the assents: I give up to you these two topics. Let us
insist upon the first, which presents an almost obvious demonstration that we
do not properly adapt the preconceptions. Do you now desire that which is
possible and that which is possible to you? Why then are you hindered? why are
you unhappy? Do you not now try to avoid the unavoidable? Why then do you fall
in with anything which you would avoid? Why are you unfortunate? Why, when you
desire a thing, does it not happen, and, when you do not desire it, does it
happen? For this is the greatest proof of unhappiness and misery: "I wish for
something, and it does not happen." And what is more wretched than I?
    It was because she could not endure this that Medea came to murder her
children: an act of a noble spirit in this view at least, for she had a just
opinion what it is for a thing not to succeed which a person wishes. Then she
says, "Thus I shall be avenged on him who has wronged and insulted me; and what
shall I gain if he is punished thus? how then shall it be done? I shall kill my
children, but I shall punish myself also: and what do I care?" This is the
aberration of soul which possesses great energy. For she did not know wherein
lies the doing of that which we wish; that you cannot get this from without,
nor yet by the alteration and new adaptation of things. Do not desire the man,
and nothing which you desire will fall to happen: do not obstinately desire
that he shall live with you: do not desire to remain in Corinth; and, in a
word, desire nothing than that which God wills. And who shall hinder you? who
shall compel you? No man shall compel you any more than he shall compel Zeus.
    When you have such a guide, and your wishes and desires are the same as
his, why do you fear disappointment? Give up your desire to wealth and your
aversion to poverty, and you will be disappointed in the one, you will fall
into the other. Well, give them up to health, and you will be unfortunate: give
them up to magistracies, honours, country, friends, children, in a word to any
of the things which are not in man's power. But give them up to Zeus and to the
rest of the gods; surrender them to the gods, let the gods govern, let your
desire and aversion be ranged on the side of the gods, and wherein will you be
any longer unhappy? But if, lazy wretch, you envy, and complain, and are
jealous, and fear, and never cease for a single day complaining both of
yourself and of the gods, why do you still speak of being educated? What kind
of an education, man? Do you mean that you have been employed about sophistical
syllogisms? Will you not, if it is possible, unlearn all these things and begin
from the beginning, and see at the same time that hitherto you have not even
touched the matter; and then, commencing from this foundation, will you not
build up all that comes after, so that nothing, may happen which you do not
choose, and nothing shall fail to happen which you do choose?
    Give me one young man who has come to the school with this intention, who
is become a champion for this matter and says, "I give up everything else, and
it is enough for me if "t shall ever be in my power to pass my life free from
hindrance and free from trouble, and to stretch out my neck to all things like
a free man, and to look up to heaven as a friend of God, and fear nothing that
can happen." Let any of you point out such a man that I may "Come, young man,
into the possession of that which is your own, it is your destiny to adorn
philosophy: yours are these possessions, yours these books, yours these
discourses." Then when he shall have laboured sufficiently and exercised
himself in this of the matter, let him come to me again and say, "I desire to
be free from passion and free from perturbation; and I wish as a pious man and
a philosopher and a diligent person to know what is my duty to the gods, what
to my parents, what to my brothers, what to my country, what to strangers."
Come also to the second matter: this also is yours. "But I have now
sufficiently studied the second part also, and I would gladly be secure and
unshaken, and not only when I am awake, but also when I am asleep, and when I
am filled with wine, and when I am melancholy." Man, you are a god, you have
great designs.
    "No: but I wish to understand what Chrysippus says in his treatise of the
Pseudomenos." Will you not hang yourself, wretch, with such your intention? And
what good will it do you? You will read the whole with sorrow, and you will
speak to others trembling, Thus you also do. "Do you wish me, brother, to read
to you, and you to me?" "You write excellently, my man; and you also
excellently in the style of Xenophon, and you in the style of Plato, and you in
the style of Antisthenes." Then, having told your dreams to one another, you
return to the same things: your desires are the same, your aversions the same,
your pursuits are the same, and your designs and purposes, you wish for the
same things and work for the same. In the next place you do not even seek for
one to give you advice, but you are vexed if you hear such things. Then you
say, "An ill-natured old fellow: when I was going away, he did not weep nor did
he say, 'Into what danger you are going: if you come off safe, my child, I will
burn lights.' This is what a good-natured man would do." It will be a great
thing for you if you do return safe, and it will be worth while to burn lights
for such a person: for you ought to be immortal and exempt from disease.
    Casting away then, as I say, this conceit of thinking that we know
something useful, we I I must come to philosophy as we apply to geometry, and
to music: but if we do not, we shall not even approach to proficiency, though
we read all the collections and commentaries of Chrysippus and those of
Antipater and Archedemus.

Chapter 18

How we should struggle against appearances

    Every habit and faculty is maintained and increased by the corresponding
actions: the habit of walking by walking, the habit of running by running. If
you would be a good reader, read; if a writer, write. But when you shall not
have read thirty days in succession, but have done something else, you will
know the consequence. In the same way, if you shall have lain down ten days,
get up and attempt to make a long walk, and you will see how your legs are
weakened. Generally, then, if you would make anything a habit, do it; if you
would not make it a habit, do not do it, but accustom yourself to do something
else in place of it.
    So it is with respect to the affections of the soul: when you have been
angry, you must know that not only has this evil befallen you, but that you
have also increased the habit, and in a manner thrown fuel upon fire. When you
have been overcome in sexual intercourse with a person, do not reckon this
single defeat only, but reckon that you have also nurtured, increased your
incontinence. For it is impossible for habits and faculties, some of them not
to be produced, when they did not exist before, and others not be increased and
strengthened by corresponding acts.
    In this manner certainly, as philosophers say, also diseases of the mind
grow up. For when you have once desired money, if reason be applied to lead to
a perception of the evil, the desire is stopped, and the ruling faculty of our
mind is restored to the original authority. But if you apply no means of cure,
it no longer returns to the same state, but, being again excited by the
corresponding appearance, it is inflamed to desire quicker than before: and
when this takes place continually, it is henceforth hardened, and the disease
of the mind confirms the love of money. For he who has had a fever, and has
been relieved from it, is not in the same state that he was before, unless he
has been completely cured. Something of the kind happens also in diseases of
the soul. Certain traces and blisters are left in it, and unless a man shall
completely efface them, when he is again lashed on the same places, the lash
will produce not blisters but sores. If then you wish not to be of an angry
temper, do not feed the habit; throw nothing on it which will increase it: at
first keep quiet, and count the days on which you have not been angry. I used
to be in passion every day; now every second day; then every third, then every
fourth. But if you have intermitted thirty days, make a sacrifice to God. For
the habit at first begins to be weakened, and then is completely destroyed. "I
have not been vexed to-day, nor the day after, nor yet on any succeeding day
during two or three months; but I took care when some exciting things
happened." Be assured that you are in a good way. To-day when I saw a handsome
person, I did not say to myself, "I wish I could lie with her," and "Happy is
her husband"; for he who says this says, "Happy is her adulterer also." Nor do
I picture the rest to my mind; the woman present, and stripping herself and
lying down by my side. I stroke my head and say, "Well done, Epictetus, you
have solved a fine little sophism, much finer than that which is called the
master sophism." And if even the woman is willing, and gives signs, and sends
messages, and if she also fondle me and come close to me, and I should abstain
and be victorious, that would be a sophism beyond that which is named "The
Liar," and "The Quiescent." Over such a victory as this a man may justly be
proud; not for proposing, the master sophism.
    How then shall this be done? Be willing at length to be approved by
yourself, be willing to appear beautiful to God, desire to he in purity with
your own pure self and with God. Then when any such appearance visits you,
Plato says, "Have recourse to expiations, go a suppliant to the temples of the
averting deities." It is even sufficient if "you resort to the society of noble
and just men," and compare yourself with them, whether you find one who is
living or dead. Go to Socrates and see him lying down with Alcibiades, and
mocking his beauty: consider what a victory he at last found that he had gained
over himself; what an Olympian victory; in what number he stood from Hercules;
so that, by the Gods, one may justly salute him, "Hail, wondrous man, you who
have conquered not less these sorry boxers and pancratiasts nor yet those who
are like them, the gladiators." By placing these objects on the other side you
will conquer the appearance: you will not be drawn away by it. But, in the
first place, be not hurried away by the rapidity of the appearance, but say,
"Appearances, wait for me a little: let me see who you are, and what you are
about: let me put you to the test." And then do not allow the appearance to
lead you on and draw lively pictures of the things which will follow; for if
you do, it will carry you off wherever it pleases. But rather bring in to
oppose it some other beautiful and noble appearance and cast out this base
appearance. And if you are accustomed to be exercised in this way, you will see
what shoulders, what sinews, what strength you have. But now it is only
trifling words, and nothing more.
    This is the true athlete, the man who exercises himself against such
appearances. Stay, wretch, do not be carried away. Great is the combat, divine
is the work; it is for kingship, for freedom, for happiness, for freedom from
perturbation. Remember God: call on him as a helper and protector, as men at
sea call on the Dioscuri in a storm. For what is a greater storm than that
which comes from appearances which are violent and drive away the reason? For
the storm itself, what else is it but an appearance? For take away the fear of
death, and suppose as many thunders and lightnings as you please, and you will
know what calm and serenity there is in the ruling faculty. But if you have
once been defeated and say that you will conquer hereafter, then say the same
again, be assured that you at last be in so wretched a condition and so weak
that you will not even know afterward that you are doing wrong, but you will
even begin to make apologies for your wrongdoing, and then you will confirm the
saying of Hesiod to be true,
       With constant ills the dilatory strives.

Chapter 19

Against those who embrace, philosophical opinions only in words

    The argument called the "ruling argument" appears to have been proposed
from such principles as these: there is in fact a common contradiction between
one another in these three positions, each two being in contradiction to the
third. The propositions are, that everything past must of necessity be true;
that an impossibility does not follow a possibility; and that thing is possible
which neither is nor t at a t will be true. Diodorus observing this
contradiction employed the probative force of the first two for the
demonstration of this proposition, "That nothing is possible which is not true
and never will be." Now another will hold these two: "That something is
possible, which is neither true nor ever will be": and "That an impossibility
does not follow a possibility," But he will not allow that everything which is
past is necessarily true, as the followers of Cleanthes seem to think, and
Antipater copiously defended them. But others maintain the other two
propositions, "That a thing is possible which is neither true nor will he
true": and "That everything which is past is necessarily true"; but then they
will maintain that an impossibility can follow a possibility. But it is
impossible to maintain these three propositions, because of their common
contradiction. If then any man should ask me which of these propositions do I
maintain? I will answer him that I do not know; but I have received this story,
that Diodorus maintained one opinion, the followers of Panthoides, I think, and
Cleanthes maintained another opinion, and those of Chrysippus a third. "What
then is your opinion?" I was not made for this purpose, to examine the
appearances that occur to me and to compare what others say and to form an
opinion of my own on the thing. Therefore I differ not at all from the
grammarian. "Who was Hector's father?" Priam. "Who were his brothers?"
Alexander and Deiphobus. "Who was their mother?" Hecuba. I have heard this
story. "From whom?" From Homer. And Hellanicus also, I think, writes about the
same things, and perhaps others like him. And what further have I about the
ruling argument? Nothing. But, if I am a vain man, especially at a banquet, I
surprise the guests by enumerating those who have written on these matters.
Both Chrysippus has written wonderfully in his first book about
"Possibilities," and Cleanthes has written specially on the subject, and
Archedemus. Antipater also has written not only in his work about
"Possibilities," but also separately in his work on the ruling argument. Have
you not read the work? "I have not read it." Read. And what profit will a man
have from it? he will be more trifling and impertinent than he is now; for what
else have you rained by reading it? What opinion have you formed on this
subject? none; but you will tell us of Helen and Priam, and the island of
Calypso which never was and never will be. And in this matter indeed it is of
no great importance if you retain the story, but have formed no opinion of your
own. But in matters of morality this happens to us much more than in these
things of which we are speaking.
    "Speak to me about good and evil." Listen:
       The wind from Ilium to Ciconian shores
       Brought me.
    "Of things some are good, some are bad, and others are indifferent. The
good then are the virtues and the things which partake of the virtues; the bad
are the vices, and the things which partake of them; and the indifferent are
the things which lie between the virtues and the vices, wealth, health, life,
death, pleasure, pain." Whence do you know this? "Hellanicus says it in his
Egyptian history"; for what difference does it make to say this, or to say that
"Diogenes has it in his Ethic," or Chrysippus or Cleanthes? Have you then
examined any of these things and formed an opinion of your own? Show how you
are used to behave in a storm on shipboard? Do you remember this division, when
the sail rattles and a man, who knows nothing of times and seasons, stands by
you when you are screaming and says, "Tell me, I ask you by the Gods, what you
were saying just now. Is it a vice to suffer shipwreck: does it participate in
vice?" Will you not take up a stick and lay it on his head? What have we to do
with you, man? we are perishing and you come to mock us? But if Caesar sent for
you to answer a charge, do you remember the distinction? If, when you are going
in, pale and trembling, a person should come up to you and say, "Why do you
tremble, man? what is the matter about which you are engaged? Does Caesar who
sits within give virtue and vice to those who go in to him?" You reply, "Why do
you also mock me and add to my present sorrows?" Still tell me, philosopher,
tell me why you tremble? Is it not death of which you run the risk, or a
prison, or pain of the body, or banishment, or disgrace? What else is there? Is
there any vice or anything which partakes of vice? What then did you use to say
of these things? "What have you to do with me, man? my own evils are enough for
me." And you say right. Your own evils are enough for you, your baseness, your
cowardice, your boasting which you showed when you sat in the school. Why did
you decorate yourself with what belonged to others? Why did you call yourself a
Stoic?
    Observe yourselves thus in your actions, and you will find to what sect you
belong. You will find that most of you are Epicureans, a few Peripatetics, and
those feeble. For wherein will you show that you really consider virtue equal
to everything else or even superior? But show me a Stoic, if you can. Where or
how? But you can show me an endless number who utter small arguments of the
Stoics. For do the same persons repeat the Epicurean opinions any worse? And
the Peripatetic, do they not handle them also with equal accuracy? who then is
a Stoic? As we call a statue Phidiac which is fashioned according to the art of
Phidias; so show me a man who is fashioned according to the doctrines which he
utters. Show me a man who is sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying and
happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him: I desire, by the
gods, to see a Stoic. You cannot show me one fashioned so; but show me at least
one who is forming, who has shown a tendency to be a Stoic. Do me this favor:
do not grudge an old man seeing a sight which I have not seen yet. Do you think
that you must show me the Zeus of Phidias or the Athena, a work of ivory and
gold? Let any of you show me a human soul ready to think as God does, and not
to blame either God or man, ready not to be disappointed about anything, not to
consider himself damaged by anything, not to be angry, not to be envious, not
to be jealous; and why should I not say it direct? desirous from a man to
become a god, and in this poor mortal body thinking of his fellowship with
Zeus. Show me the man. But you cannot. Why then do you delude yourselves and
cheat others? and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you, and
walk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do not
belong to you?
    And now I am your teacher, and you are instructed in my school. And I have
this purpose, to make you free from restraint, compulsion, hindrance, to make
you free, prosperous, happy, looking to God in everything small and great. And
you are here to learn and practice these things. Why, then, do you not finish
the work, if you also have such a purpose as you ought to have, and if I, in
addition to the purpose, also have such qualification as I ought to have? What
is that which is wanting? When I see an artificer and material by him, I expect
the work. Here, then, is the artificer, here the material; what is it that we
want? Is not the thing, one that can be taught? It is. Is it not then in our
power? The only thing of all that is in our power. Neither wealth is in our
power, nor health, nor reputation, nor in a word anything else except the right
use of appearances. This is by nature free from restraint, this alone is free
from impediment. Why then do you not finish the work? Tell me the reason. For
it is either through my fault that you do not finish it, or through your own
fault, or through the nature of the thing. The thing itself is possible, and
the only thing in our power. It remains then that the fault is either in me or
in you, or, what is nearer the truth, in both. Well then, are you willing that
we begin at last to bring such a purpose into this school, and to take no
notice of the past? Let us only make a beginning. Trust to me, and you will
see.

Chapter 20

Against the Epicureans and Academics

    The propositions which are true and evident are of necessity used even by
those who contradict them: and a man might perhaps consider it to be the
greatest proof of a thing being evident that it is found to be necessary even
for him who denies it to make use of it at the same time. For instance, if a
man should deny that there is anything universally true, it is plain that he
must make the contradictory negation, that nothing is universally true. What,
wretch, do you not admit even this? For what else is this than to affirm that
whatever is universally affirmed is false? Again, if a man should come forward
and say: "Know that there is nothing that can be known, but all things are
incapable of sure evidence"; or if another say, "Believe me and you will be the
better for it, that a man ought not to believe anything"; or again, if another
should say, "Learn from me, man, that it is not possible to learn anything; I
tell you this and will teach you, if you choose." Now in what respect do these
differ from those? Whom shall I name? Those who call themselves Academics?
"Men, agree that no man agrees: believe us that no man believes anybody."
    Thus Epicurus also, when he designs to destroy the natural fellowship of
mankind, at the same time makes use of that which he destroys. For what does he
say? "Be not deceived men, nor be led astray, nor be mistaken: there is no
natural fellowship among rational animals; believe me. But those who say
otherwise, deceive you and seduce you by false reasons." What is this to you?
Permit us to be deceived. Will you fare worse, if all the rest of us are
persuaded that there is a natural fellowship among us, and that it ought by all
means to be preserved? Nay, it will be much better and safer for you. Man, why
do you trouble yourself about us? Why do you keep awake for us? Why do you
light your lamp? Why do you rise early? Why do you write so many books, that no
one of us may be deceived about the gods and believe that they take care of
men; or that no one may suppose the nature of good to be other than pleasure?
For if this is so, lie down and sleep, and lead the life of a worm, of which
you judged yourself worthy: eat and drink, and enjoy women, and ease yourself,
and snore. And what is it to you, how the rest shall think about these things,
whether right or wrong? For what have we to do with you? You take care of sheep
because they supply us with wool, and milk, and, last of all, with their flesh.
Would it not be a desirable thing if men could be lulled and enchanted by the
Stoics, and sleep and present themselves to you and to those like you to be
shorn and milked? For this you ought to say to your brother Epicureans: but
ought you not to conceal it from others, and particularly before everything to
persuade them that we are by nature adapted for fellowship, that temperance is
a good thing; in order that all things may be secured for you? Or ought we to
maintain this fellowship with some and not with others? With whom, then, ought
we to maintain it? With such as on their part also maintain it, or with such as
violate this fellowship? And who violate it more than you who establish such
doctrines?
    What then was it that waked Epicurus from his sleepiness, and compelled him
to write what he did write? What else was it than that which is the strongest
thing in men, nature, which draws a man to her own will though he be unwilling
and complaining? "For since," she says, "you think that there is no community
among mankind, write this opinion and leave it for others, and break your sleep
to do this, and by your own practice condemn your own opinions." Shall we then
say that Orestes was agitated by the Erinyes and roused from his deep sleep,
and did not more savage Erinyes and Pains rouse Epicurus from his sleep and not
allow him to rest, but compelled him to make known his own evils, as madness
and wine did the Galli? So strong and invincible is man's nature. For how can a
vine be moved not in the mariner of a vine, but in the manner of an olive tree?
or on the other hand how can an olive tree be moved not in the manner of an
olive tree, but in the manner of a vine? It is impossible: it cannot be
conceived. Neither then is it possible for a man completely to lose the
movements of a man; and even those who are deprived of their genital members
are not able to deprive themselves of man's desires. Thus Epicurus also
mutilated all the offices of a man, and of a father of a family, and of a
citizen and of a friend, but he did not mutilate human desires, for he could
not; not more than the lazy Academics can cast away or blind their own senses,
though they have tried with all their might to do it. What a shame is this?
when a man has received from nature measures and rules for the knowing of
truth, and does not strive to add to these measures and rules and to improve
them, but, just the contrary, endeavors to take away and destroy whatever
enables us to discern the truth?
    What say you philosopher? piety and sanctity, what do you think that they
are? "If you like, I will demonstrate that they are good things." Well,
demonstrate it, that our citizens may be turned and honor the deity and may no
longer be negligent about things of the highest value. "Have you then the
demonstrations?" I have, and I am thankful. "Since then you are well pleased
with them, hear the contrary: 'That there are no Gods, and, if there are, they
take no care of men, nor is there any fellowship between us and them; and that
this piety and sanctity which is talked of among most men is the lying of
boasters and sophists, or certainly of legislators for the purpose of
terrifying and checking wrong-doers.'" Well done, philosopher, you have done
something for our citizens, you have brought back all the young men to contempt
of things divine. "What then, does not this satisfy you? Learn now, that
justice is nothing, that modesty is folly, that a father is nothing, a son
nothing." Well done, philosopher, persist, persuade the young men, that we may
have more with the same opinions as you who say the same as you. From such you
an principles as those have grown our well-constituted states; by these was
Sparta founded: Lycurgus fixed these opinions in the Spartans by his laws and
education, that neither is the servile condition more base than honourable, nor
the condition of free men more honorable than base, and that those who died at
Thermopylae died from these opinions; and through what other opinions did the
Athenians leave their city? Then those who talk thus, marry and beget children,
and employ themselves in public affairs and make themselves priests and
interpreters. Of whom? of gods who do not exist: and they consult the Pythian
priestess that they may hear lies, and they repeat the oracles to others.
Monstrous impudence and imposture.
    Man what are you doing? are you refuting yourself every day; and will you
not give up these frigid attempts? When you eat, where do you carry your hand
to? to your mouth or to your eye? when you wash yourself, what do you go into?
do you ever call a pot a dish, or a ladle a spit? If I were a slave of any of
these men, even if I must be flayed by him dally, I would rack him. If he said,
"Boy, throw some olive-oil into the bath," I would take pickle sauce and pour
it down on his head. "What is this?" he would say. An appearance was presented
to me, I swear by your genius, which could not be distinguished from oil and
was exactly like it. "Here give me the barley drink," he says. I would fill and
carry him a dish of sharp sauce. "Did I not ask for the barley drink?" Yes,
master; this is the barley drink. "Take it and smell; take it and taste." How
do you know then if our senses deceive us? If I had three or four fellow-slaves
of the same opinion, I should force him to hang himself through passion or to
change his mind. But now they mock us by using all the things which nature
gives, and in words destroying them.
    Grateful indeed are men and modest, who, if they do nothing else, are daily
eating bread and yet are shameless enough to say, we do not know if there is a
Demeter or her daughter Persephone or a Pluto; not to mention that they are
enjoying the night and the day, the seasons of the year, and the stars, and the
sea, and the land, and the co-operation of mankind, and yet they are not moved
in any degree by these things to turn their attention to them; but they only
seek to belch out their little problem, and when they have exercised their
stomach to go off to the bath. But what they shall say, and about what things
or to what persons, and what their hearers shall learn from this talk, they
care not even in the least degree, nor do they care if any generous youth after
hearing such talk should suffer any harm from it, nor after he has suffered
harm should lose all the seeds of his generous nature: nor if we should give an
adulterer help toward being shameless in his acts; nor if a public peculator
should lay hold of some cunning excuse from these doctrines; nor if another who
neglects his parents should be confirmed in his audacity by this teaching. What
then in your opinion is good or bad? This or that? Why then should a man say
any more in reply to such persons as these, or give them any reason or listen
to any reasons from them, or try to convince them? By Zeus one might much
sooner expect to make certainties change their mind than those who are become
so deaf and blind to their own evils.

Chapter 21

Of inconsistency

    Some things men readily confess, and other things they do not. No one then
will confess that he is a fool or without understanding; but, quite the
contrary, you will hear all men saying, "I wish that I had fortune equal to my
understanding." But readily confess that they are timid, and they say: "I am
rather timid, I confess; but to other respects you will not find me to
foolish." A man will not readily confess that he is intemperate; and that he is
unjust he will not confess at all. He will by no means confess that be is
envious or a busybody. Most men will confess that they are compassionate. What
then is the reason? The chief thing is inconsistency and confusion in the
things which relate to good and evil. But different men have different reasons;
and generally what they imagine to be base, they do not confess at all. But
they suppose timidity to be a characteristic of a good disposition, and
compassion also; but silliness to be the absolute characteristic of a slave.
And they do not at all admit the things which are offenses against society. But
in the case of most errors, for this reason chiefly, they are induced to
confess them, because they that there is something involuntary in them as in
timidity and compassion; and if a man confess that he is in any respect
intemperate, he alleges love as an excuse for what is involuntary. But men do
not imagine injustice to be at all There is also in jealousy, as they suppose,
something involuntary; and for this reason they confess to jealousy also.
    Living among such men, who are so confused so ignorant of what they say,
and of evils which they have or have not, and why they have them, or how they
shall be relieved of them, I think it is worth the trouble for a man to watch
constantly "Whether I also am one of them, what imagination I have about
myself, how I conduct myself, whether I conduct myself as a prudent man,
whether I conduct myself as a temperate man, whether I ever say this, that I
have been taught to be prepared for everything that may happen. Have I the
consciousness, which a man who knows nothing ought to have, that I know
nothing? Do I go to my teacher as men go to oracles, prepared to obey? or do I
like a sniveling boy go to my school to learn history and understand the books
which I did not understand before, and, if it should happen so, to explain them
also to others?" Man, you have had a fight in the house with a poor slave, you
have turned the family upside down, you have frightened the neighbours, and you
come to me as if you were a wise man, and you take your seat and judge how I
have explained some word, and how I have babbled whatever came into my head.
You come full of envy, and humbled, because you bring nothing from home; and
you sit during, the discussion thinking of nothing else than how your father is
disposed toward you and your brother. "What are they saying about me there? now
they think that I am improving, and are saying, 'He will return with all
knowledge.' I wish I could learn everything before I return: but much labour is
necessary, and no one sends me anything, and the baths at Nicopolis are dirty;
everything is bad at home, and bad here."
    Then they say, "No one gains any profit from the school." Why, who comes to
the school, who comes for the purpose of being improved? who comes to present
his opinions to he purified? who comes to learn what he is in want of? Why do
you wonder then if you carry back from the school the very things which you
bring into it? For you come not to lay aside or to correct them or to receive
other principles in place of them. By no means, nor anything like it. You
rather look to this, whether you possess already that for which you come. You
wish to prattle about theorems? What then? Do you not become greater triflers?
Do not your little theorems give you some opportunity of display? You solve
sophistical syllogisms. Do you not examine the assumptions of the syllogism
named "The Liar"? Do you not examine hypothetical syllogisms? Why, then, are
you still vexed if you receive the things for which you come to the school?
"Yes; but if my child die or my brother, or if I must die or be racked, what
good will these things do me?" Well, did you come for this? for this do you sit
by my side? did you ever for this light your lamp or keep awake? or, when you
went out to the walking-place, did you ever propose any appearance that had
been presented to you instead of a syllogism, and did you and your friends
discuss it together? Where and when? Then you say, "Theorems are useless." To
whom? To such as make a bad use of them. For eyesalves are not useless to those
who use them as they ought and when they ought. Fomentations are not useless.
Dumb-bells are not useless; but they are useless to some, useful to others. If
you ask me now if syllogisms are useful, I will tell you that they are useful,
and if you choose, I will prove it. "How then will they in any way be useful to
me?" Man, did you ask if they are useful to you, or did you ask generally? Let
him who is suffering from dysentery ask me if vinegar is useful: I will say
that it is useful. "Will it then be useful to me?" I will say, "No." Seek first
for the discharge to be stopped and the ulcers to be closed. And do you, O men,
first cure the ulcers and stop the discharge; be tranquil in your mind, bring
it free from distraction into the school, and you will know what power reason
has.

Chapter 22

On friendship

    What a man applies himself to earnestly, that he naturally loves. Do men
then apply themselves earnestly to the things which are bad? By no means. Well,
do they apply themselves to things which in no way concern themselves? Not to
these either. It remains, then, that they employ themselves earnestly only
about things which are good; and if they are earnestly employed about things,
they love such things also. Whoever, then, understands what is good, can also
know how to love; but he who cannot distinguish good from bad, and things which
are neither good nor bad from both, can he possess the power of loving? To
love, then, is only in the power of the wise.
    "How is this?" a man may say; am foolish, and yet love my child." I am
surprised indeed that you have begun by making the admission that you are
foolish. For what are you deficient in? Can you not make use of your senses? do
you not distinguish appearances? do you not use food which is suitable for your
body, and clothing and habitation? Why then do you admit that you are foolish?
It is in truth because you are often disturbed by appearances and perplexed,
and their power of persuasion often conquers you; and sometimes you think these
things to be good, and then the same things to be bad, and lastly neither good
nor bad; and in short you grieve, fear, envy, are disturbed, you are changed.
This is the reason why you confess that you are foolish. And are you not
changeable in love? But wealth, and pleasure and, in a word, things themselves,
do you sometimes think them to he good and sometimes bad? and do you not think
the same men at one time to be good, at another time bad? and have you not at
one time a friendly feeling toward them and at another time the feeling of an
enemy? and do you not at one time praise them and at another time blame them?
"Yes; I have these feelings also." Well then, do you think that he who has been
deceived about a man is his friend? "Certainly not." And he who has selected a
man as his friend and is of a changeable disposition, has he good-will toward
him? "He has not." And he who now abuses a man, and afterward admires him?
"This man also has no good-will to the other." Well then, did you never see
little dogs caressing and playing with one another, so that you might say there
is nothing more friendly? but, that you may know what friendship is, throw a
bit of flesh among them, and you will learn. Throw between yourself and your
son a little estate, and you will know how soon he will wish to bury you and
how soon you wish your son to die. Then you will change your tone and say,
"What a son I have brought up! He has long been wishing to bury me." Throw a
smart girl between you; and do you, the old man, love her, and the young one
will love her too, If a little fame intervene, or dangers, it will be just the
same. You will utter the words of the father of Admetus!
       Life gives you pleasure: and why not your father.
    Do you think that Admetus did not love his own child when he was little?
that he was not in agony when the child had a fever? that he did not often say,
"I wish I had the fever instead of the child?" then when the test (the thing)
came and was near, see what words they utter. Were not Eteocles and Polynices
from the same mother and from the same father? Were they not brought up
together, had they not lived together, drunk together, slept together, and
often kissed one another? So that, if any man, I think, had seen them, he would
have ridiculed the philosophers for the paradoxes which they utter about
friendship. But when a quarrel rose between them about the royal power, as
between dogs about a bit of meat, see what they say,
       Polynices: Where will you take your station before the towers?
       Eteocles: Why do you ask me this?
       Polynices: I place myself opposite and try to kill you.
       Eteocles: I also wish to do the same.
Such are the wishes that they utter.
    For universally, be not deceived, every animal is attached to nothing so
much as to its own interest. Whatever then appears to it an impediment to this
interest, whether this be a brother, or a father, or a child, or beloved, or
lover, it hates, spurns, curses: for its nature is to love nothing so much as
its own interest; this is father, and brother and kinsman, and country, and
God. When, then, the gods appear to us to be an impediment to this, we abuse
them and throw down their statues and burn their temples, as Alexander ordered
the temples of AEsculapius to be burned when his dear friend died.
    For this reason if a man put in the same place his interest, sanctity,
goodness, and country, and parents, and friends, all these are secured: but if
he puts in one place his interest, in another his friends, and his country and
his kinsmen and justice itself, all these give way being borne down by the
weight of interest. For where the "I" and the "Mine" are placed, to that place
of necessity the animal inclines: if in the flesh, there is the ruling power:
if in the will, it is there: and if it is in externals, it is there. If then I
am there where my will is, then only shall I be a friend such as I ought to be,
and son, and father; for this will he my interest, to maintain the character of
fidelity, of modesty, of patience, of abstinence, of active cooperation, of
observing my relations. But if I put myself in one place, and honesty in
another, then the doctrine of Epicurus becomes strong, which asserts either
that there is no honesty or it is that which opinion holds to be honest.
    It was through this ignorance that the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians
quarreled, and the Thebans with both; and the great king quarreled with Hellas,
and the Macedonians with both; and the Romans with the Getae. And still earlier
the Trojan war happened for these reasons. Alexander was the guest of Menelaus;
and if any man had seen their friendly disposition, he would not have believed
any one who said that they were not friends. But there was cast between them a
bit of meat, a handsome woman, and about her war arose. And now when you see
brothers to be friends appearing to have one mind, do not conclude from this
anything about their friendship, not even if they say it and swear that it is
impossible for them to be separated from one another. For the ruling principle
of a bad man cannot be trusted, it is insecure, has no certain rule by which it
is directed, and is overpowered at different times by different appearances.
But examine, not what other men examine, if they are born of the same parents
and brought up together, and under the same pedagogue; but examine this only,
wherein they place their interest, whether in externals or in the will. If in
externals, do not name them friends, no more than name them trustworthy or
constant, or brave or free: do not name them even men, if you have any
judgment. For that is not a principle of human nature which makes them bite one
another, and abuse one another, and occupy deserted places or public places, as
if they were mountains, and in the courts of justice display the acts of
robbers; nor yet that which makes them intemperate and adulterers and
corrupters, nor that which makes them do whatever else men do against one
another through this one opinion only, that of placing themselves and their
interests in the things which are not within the power of their will. But if
you hear that in truth these men think the good to be only there, where will
is, and where there is a right use of appearances, no longer trouble yourself
whether they are father or son, or brothers, or have associated a long time and
are companions, but when you have ascertained this only, confidently declare
that they are friends, as you declare that they are faithful, that they are
just. For where else is friendship than where there is fidelity, and modesty,
where there is a communion of honest things and of nothing else?
    "But," you may say, "such a one treated me with regard so long; and did he
not love me?" How do you know, slave, if he did not regard you in the same way
as he wipes his shoes with a sponge, or as he takes care of his beast? How do
you know, when you have ceased to be useful as a vessel, he will not throw you
away like a broken platter? "But this woman is my wife, and we have lived
together so long." And how long did Eriphyle live with Amphiaraus, and was the
mother of children and of many? But a necklace came between them. "And what is
a necklace?" It is the opinion about such things. That was the bestial
principle, that was the thing which broke asunder the friendship between
husband and wife, that which did not allow the woman to be a wife nor the
mother to be a mother. And let every man among you who has seriously resolved
either to be a friend himself or to have another for his friend, cut out these
opinions, hate them, drive them from his soul. And thus, first of all, he will
not reproach himself, he will not be at variance with himself, will not change
his mind, he will not torture himself. In the next place, to another also, who
is like himself, he will be altogether and completely a friend. But he will
bear with the man who is unlike himself, he will be kind to him, gentle, ready
to pardon on account of his ignorance, on account of his being mistaken in
things of the greatest importance; but he will be harsh to no man, being well
convinced of Plato's doctrine that every mind is deprived of truth unwillingly.
If you cannot do this, yet you can do in all other respects as friends do,
drink together, and lodge together, and sail together, and you may be born of
the same parents; for snakes also are: but neither will they be friends nor
you, so long as you retain these bestial and cursed opinions.

Chapter 23

On the power of speaking

    Every man will read a book with more pleasure or even with more case, if it
is written in fairer characters. Therefore every man will also listen more
readily to what is spoken, if it is signified by appropriate and becoming
words. We must not say, then, that there is no faculty of expression: for this
affirmation is the characteristic of an impious and also of a timid man. Of an
impious man, because he undervalues the gifts which come from God, just as if
he would take away the commodity of the power of vision, or of hearing, or of
seeing. Has, then, God given you eyes to no purpose? and to no purpose has he
infused into them a spirit so strong and of such skillful contrivance as to
reach a long way and to fashion the forms of things which are seen? What
messenger is so swift and vigilant? And to no purpose has he made the
interjacent atmosphere so efficacious and elastic that the vision penetrates
through the atmosphere which is in a manner moved? And to no purpose has he
made light, without the presence of which there would be no use in any other
thing?
    Man, be neither ungrateful for these gifts nor yet forget the things which
are superior to them. But indeed for the power of seeing and hearing, and
indeed for life itself, and for the things which contribute to support it, for
the fruits which are dry, and for wine and oil give thanks to God: but remember
that he has given you something else better than all these, I mean the power of
using them, proving them and estimating the value of each. For what is that
which gives information about each of these powers, what each of them is worth?
Is it each faculty itself? Did you ever hear the faculty of vision saying
anything about itself? or the faculty of hearing? or wheat, or barley, or a
horse or a dog? No; but they are appointed as ministers and slaves to serve the
faculty which has the power of making use of the appearances of things. And if
you inquire what is the value of each thing, of whom do you inquire? who
answers you? How then can any other faculty be more powerful than this, which
uses the rest as ministers and itself proves each and pronounces about them?
for which of them knows what itself is, and what is its own value? which of
them knows when it ought to employ itself and when not? what faculty is it
which opens and closes the eyes, and turns them away from objects to which it
ought not to apply them and does apply them to other objects? Is it the faculty
of vision? No; but it is the faculty of the will. What is that faculty which
closes and opens the ears? what is that by which they are curious and
inquisitive, or, on the contrary, unmoved by what is said? is it the faculty of
hearing? It is no other than the faculty of the will. Will this faculty then,
seeing that it is amid all the other faculties which are blind and dumb and
unable to see anything else except the very acts for which they are appointed
in order to minister to this and serve it, but this faculty alone sees sharp
and sees what is the value of each of the rest; will this faculty declare to us
that anything else is the best, or that itself is? And what else does the do
when it is opened than see? But whether we ought to look on the wife of a
certain person, and in what manner, who tells us? The faculty of the will. And
whether we ought to believe what is said or not to believe it, and if we do
believe, whether we ought to be moved by it or not, who tells us? Is it not the
faculty of the will? But this faculty of speaking and of ornamenting words, if
there is indeed any such peculiar faculty, what else does it do, when there
happens to be discourse about a thing, than to ornament the words and arrange
them as hairdressers do the hair? But whether it is better to speak or to be
silent, and better to speak in this way or that way, and whether this is
becoming or not becoming and the season for each and the and the use, what else
tells us than the faculty of the will? Would you have it then to come forward
and condemn itself?
    "What then," it says, "if the fact is so, can that which ministers be
superior to that to which it ministers, can the horse be superior to the rider,
or the do, to the huntsman, or the instrument to the musician, or the servants
to the king?" What is that which makes use of the rest? The will. What takes
care of all? The will. What destroys the whole man, at one time by hunger, at
another time by hanging, and at another time by a precipice? The will. Then is
anything stronger in men than this? and how is it possible that the things
which are subject to restraint are stronger than that which is not What things
are naturally formed to hinder the faculty of vision? Both will and things
which do not depend on the faculty of the will. It is the same with the faculty
of hearing, with the faculty of speaking in like manner. But what has a natural
power of hindering the will? Nothing which is independent of the will; but only
the will itself, when it is perverted. Therefore this is alone vice or alone
virtue.
    Then being so great a faculty and set over all the rest, let it come
forward and tell us that the most excellent of all things is the flesh. Not
even if the flesh itself declared that it is the most excellent, would any
person bear that it should say this. But what is it, Epicurus, which pronounces
this, which wrote about "The End of our Being," which wrote on "The Nature of
Things," which wrote about the Canon, which led you to wear a beard, which
wrote when it was dying that it was spending the last and a happy day? Was this
the flesh or the will? Then do you admit that you possess anything superior to
this? and are you not mad? are you in fact so blind and deaf?
    What then? Does any man despise the other faculties I hope not. Does any
man say that there is no use or excellence in the speaking faculty? I hope not.
That would be foolish, impious, ungrateful toward God. But a man renders to
each thing its due value. For there is some use even in an ass, but not so much
as in an ox: there is also use in a dog, but not so much as in a slave: there
is also some use in a slave, but not so much as in citizens: there is also some
use in citizens, but riot so much as in magistrates. Not, indeed, because some
things are superior, must we undervalue the use which other things have. There
is a certain value in the power of speaking, but it is not so great as the
power of the will. When, then, I speak thus, let no man think that I ask you to
neglect the power of speaking, for neither do I ask you to neglect the eyes,
nor the ears nor the hands nor the feet nor clothing nor shoes. But if you ask
me, "What, then, is the most excellent of all things?" what must I say? I
cannot say the power of speaking, but the power of the will, when it is right.
For it is this which uses the other, and all the other faculties both small and
great. For when this faculty of the will is set right, a man who is not good
becomes good: but when it falls, a man becomes bad. It is through this that we
are unfortunate, that we are fortunate, that we blame one another, are pleased
with one another. In a word, it is this which if neglect it makes unhappiness,
and if we carefully look after it makes happiness.
    But to take away the faculty of speaking, and to say that there is no such
faculty in reality, is the act not only of an ungrateful man toward those who
gave it, but also of a cowardly man: for such a person seems to me to fear if
there is any faculty of this kind, that we shall not be able to despise it.
Such also are those who say that there is no difference between beauty and
ugliness. Then it would happen that a man would be affected in the same way if
he saw Thersites and if he saw Achilles; in the same way, if he saw Helen and
any other woman. But these are foolish and clownish notions, and the notions of
men who know not the nature of each thing, but are afraid, if a man shall see
the difference, that he shall immediately be seized and carried off vanquished.
But this is the great matter; to leave to each thing the power which it has,
and leaving to it this power to see what is the worth of the power, and to
learn what is the most excellent of all things, and to pursue this always, to
be diligent about this, considering t all other things of secondary value
compared with this, but yet, as far as we can, not neglecting all those other
things. For we must take care of the eyes also, not as if they were the most
excellent thing, but we must take care of them on account of the most excellent
thing, because it will not be in its true natural condition, if it does not
rightly use the other faculties, and prefer some things to others.
    What then is usually done? Men generally act as a traveler would do on his
way to his own country, when he enters a good inn, and being pleased with it
should remain there. Man, you have forgotten your purpose: you were not
traveling to this inn, but you were pass through it. "But this is a pleasant
inn." And how many other inns are pleasant? and how many meadows are pleasant?
yet only passing through. But your purpose is this, return to your country, to
relieve your kinsmen of anxiety, to discharge the duties of a citizen, to
marry, to beget children, to fill the usual magistracies. For you are not come
to select more pleasant places, but to live in these where you were born and of
which you were made a citizen. Something of the kind takes place in the matter
which we are considering. Since, by the aid of speech and such communication as
you receive here, you must advance to perfection, and purge your will, and
correct the faculty which makes use of the appearances of things; and since it
is necessary also for the teaching of theorems to be effected by a certain mode
of expression and with a certain variety and sharpness, some persons captivated
by these very things abide in them, one captivated by the expression, another
by syllogisms, another again by sophisms, and still another by some other inn
of the kind; and there they stay and waste away as if they were among Sirens.
    Man, your purpose was to make yourself capable of using conformably to
nature the appearances presented to you, in your desires not to be frustrated,
in your aversion from things not to fall into that which you would avoid, never
to have no luck, nor ever to have bad luck, to be free, not hindered, not
compelled, conforming yourself to the administration of Zeus, obeying it, well
satisfied with this, blaming no one, charging no one with fault, able from your
whole soul to utter these verses:
       "Lead me, O Zeus, and thou, too, Destiny."
Then having this purpose before you, if some little form of expression pleases
you, if some theorems please you, do you abide among them and choose t dwell o
well there, forgetting the things at home, and do you say, "These things are
fine"? Who says that they are not fine? but only as being a way home, as inns
are. For what hinders you from being an unfortunate man, even if you speak like
Demosthenes? and what prevents you, if you can resolve syllogisms like
Chrysippus, from being wretched, from sorrowing, from envying, in a word, from
being disturbed, from being unhappy? Nothing. You see then that these were
inns, worth nothing; and that the purpose before you was something else. When I
speak thus to some persons, they think that I am rejecting care about speaking,
or care about theorems. I am not rejecting this care, but I am rejecting the
abiding about these things incessantly and putting our hopes in them. If a man
by this teaching does harm to those who listen to him, reckon me too among
those who do this harm: for I am not able, when I see one thing which is most
excellent and supreme, to say that another is so, in order to please you.

Chapter 24

To a person who was one of those who was not valued by him

    A certain person said to him: "Frequently I desired to hear you and came to
you, and you never gave me any answer: and now, if it is possible, I entreat
you to say something to me." Do you think, said Epictetus, that as there is an
art in anything else, so there is also an art in speaking, and that he who has
the art, will speak skillfully, and he who has not, will speak unskillfully? "I
do think so." He, then, who by speaking receives benefit himself and is able to
benefit others, will speak skillfully: but he who is rather damaged by speaking
and does damage to others, will he be unskilled in this art of speaking? And
you may find that some are damaged and others benefited by speaking. And are
all who hear benefited by what they hear? Or will you find that among them also
some are benefited and some damaged? "There are both among these also," he
said. In this case also, then, those who hear skillfully are benefited, and
those who hear unskillfully are damaged? He admitted this. Is there then a
skill in hearing also, as there is in speaking? "It seems so." If you choose,
consider the matter in this way also. The practice of music, to whom does it
belong? "To a musician." And the proper making of a statue, to whom do you
think that it belongs? "To a statuary." And the looking at a statue skillfully,
does this appear to you to require the aid of no art? "This also requires the
aid of art." Then if speaking properly is the business of the skillful man, do
you see that to hear also with benefit is the business of the skillful man? Now
as to speaking and hearing perfectly, and usefully, let us for the present, if
you please, say no more, for both of us are a long way from everything of the
kind. But I think that every man will allow this, that he who is going to hear
philosophers requires some amount of practice in hearing. Is it not so?
    Tell me then about what I should talk to you: about what matter are you
able to listen? "About good and evil." Good and evil in what? In a horse? "No."
Well, in an ox? "No." What then? In a man? "Yes." Do know then what a man is,
what the notion is that we have of him, or have we our ears in any degree
practiced about this matter? But do you understand what nature is? or can you
even in any degree understand me when I say, "I shall use demonstration to you?
" How? Do you understand this very thing, what demonstration is, or how
anything is demonstrated, or by what means; or what things are like
demonstration, but are not demonstration? Do you know what is true or what is
false? What is consequent on a thing, what is repugnant to a thing, or not
consistent, or inconsistent? But must I excite you to philosophy, and how?
Shall I show to you the repugnance in the opinions of most men, through which
they differ about things good and evil, and about things which are profitable
and unprofitable, when you know not this very thing, what repugnance is? Show
me then what I shall accomplish by discoursing with you; excite my inclination
to do this. As the grass which is suitable, when it is presented to a sheep,
moves its inclination to eat, but if you present to it a stone or bread, it
will not be moved to eat; so there are in us certain natural inclinations also
to speak, when the hearer shall appear to be somebody, when he himself shall
excite us: but when he shall sit by us like a stone or like grass, how can he
excite a man's desire? Does the vine say to the husbandman, "Take care of me?"
No, but the vine by showing in itself that it will be profitable to the
husbandman, if he does take care of it, invites him to exercise care. When
children are attractive and lively, whom do they not invite to play with them,
and crawl with them, and lisp with them? But who is eager to play with an ass
or to bray with it? for though it is small, it is still a little ass.
    "Why then do you say nothing to me?" I can only say this to you, that he
who knows not who he is, and for what purpose he exists, and what is this
world, and with whom he is associated, and what things are the good and the
bad, and the beautiful and the ugly, and who neither understands discourse nor
demonstration, nor what is true nor what is false, and who is not able to
distinguish them, will neither desire according to nature, nor turn away, nor
move upward, nor intend, nor assent, nor dissent, nor suspend his judgment: to
say all in a few words, he will go about dumb and blind, thinking that he is
somebody, but being nobody. Is this so now for the first time? Is it not the
fact that, ever since the human race existed, all errors and misfortunes have
arisen through this ignorance? Why did Agamemnon and Achilles quarrel with one
another? Was it not through not knowing what things are profitable and not
profitable? Does not the one say it is profitable to restore Chryseis to her
father, and does not the other say that it is not profitable? does not the one
say that he ought to take the prize of another, and does not the other say that
he ought not? Did they not for these reasons forget both who they were and for
what purpose they had come there? Oh, man, for what purpose did you come? to
gain mistresses or to fight? "To fight." With whom? the Trojans or the
Hellenes? "With the Trojans." Do you then leave Hector alone and draw your
sword against your own king? And do you, most excellent Sir, neglect the duties
of the king, you who are the people's guardian and have such cares; and are you
quarreling about a little girl with the most warlike of your allies, whom you
ought by every means to take care of and protect? and do you become worse than
a well-behaved priest who treats you these fine gladiators with all respect? Do
you see what kind of things ignorance of what is profitable does?
    "But I also am rich." Are you then richer than Agamemnon? "But I am also
handsome." Are you then more handsome than Achilles? "But I have also beautiful
hair." But had not Achilles more beautiful hair and gold-colored? and he did
not comb it elegantly nor dress it. "But I am also strong." Can you then lift
so great a stone as Hector or Ajax? "But I am also of noble birth." Are you the
son of a goddess mother? are you the son of a father sprung from Zeus? What
good then do these things do to him, when he sits and weeps for a girl? "But I
am an orator." And was he not? Do you not see how he handled the most skillful
of the Hellenes in oratory, Odysseus and Phoenix? how he stopped their mouths?
    This is all that I have to say to you; and I say even this not willingly.
"Why?" Because you have not roused me. For what must I look to in order to be
roused, as men who are expert in are roused by generous horses? Must I look to
your body? You treat it disgracefully. To your dress? That is luxurious. To
your behavior to your look? That is the same as nothing. When you would listen
to a philosopher, do not say to him, "You tell me nothing"; but only show
yourself worthy of hearing or fit for hearing; and you will see how you will
move the speaker.

Chapter 25

That logic is necessary

    When one of those who were present said, "Persuade me that logic is
necessary," he replied: Do you wish me to prove this to you? The answer was,
"Yes." Then I must use a demonstrative form of speech. This was granted. How
then will you know if I am cheating you by argument? The man was silent. Do you
see, said Epictetus, that you yourself are admitting that logic is necessary,
if without it you cannot know so much as this, whether logic is necessary or
not necessary

Chapter 26

What is the property of error

    Every error comprehends contradiction: for since he who errs does not wish
to err, but to he right, it is plain that he does not do what he wishes. For
what does the thief wish to do? That which is for his own interest. If, then,
the theft is not for his interest, he does not do that which he wishes. But
every rational: soul is by nature offended at contradiction, and so long as it
does not understand this contradiction, it is not hindered from doing
contradictory things: but when it does understand the contradiction, it must of
necessity avoid the contradiction and avoid it as much as a man must dissent
from the false when he sees that a thing is false; but so long as this
falsehood does not appear to him, he assents to it as to truth.
    He, then, is strong in argument and has the faculty of exhorting and
confuting, who is able to show to each man the contradiction through which he
errs and clearly to prove how he does not do that which he wishes and does that
which he does not wish. For if any one shall show this, a man will himself
withdraw from that which he does; but so long as you do not show this, do not
be surprised if a man persists in his practice; for having the appearance of
doing right, he does what he does. For this reason Socrates, also trusting to
this power, used to say, "I am used to call no other witness of what I say, but
I am always satisfied with him with whom I am discussing, and I ask him to give
his opinion and call him as a witness, and through he is only one, he is
sufficient in the place of all." For Socrates knew by what the rational soul is
moved, just like a pair of scales, and that it must incline, whether it chooses
or not. Show the rational governing faculty a contradiction, and it will
withdraw from it; but if you do not show it, rather blame yourself than him who
is not persuaded.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK THREE

Chapter 1

Of finery in dress

    A certain young man a rhetorician came to see Epictetus, with his hair
dressed more carefully than was usual and his attire in an ornamental style;
whereupon Epictetus said: Tell me you do not think that some dogs are beautiful
and some horses, and so of all other animals. "I do think so," the youth
replied. Are not then some men also beautiful and others ugly? "Certainly." Do
we, then, for the same reason call each of them in the same kind beautiful, or
each beautiful for something peculiar? And you will judge of this matter thus.
Since we see a dog naturally formed for one thing, and a horse for another, and
for another still, as an example, a nightingale, we may generally and not
improperly declare each of them to be beautiful then when it is most excellent
according to its nature; but since the nature of each is different, each of
them seems to me to be beautiful in a different way. Is it not so? He admitted
that it was. That then which makes a dog beautiful, makes a horse ugly; and
that which makes a horse beautiful, makes a dog ugly, if it is true that their
natures are different. "It seems to be so." For I think that what makes a
pancratiast beautiful, makes a wrestler to be not good, and a runner to be most
ridiculous; and he who is beautiful for the Pentathlon, is very ugly for
wrestling. "It is so," said he. What, then, makes a man beautiful? Is that
which in its kind makes both a dog and a horse beautiful? "It is," he said.
What then makes a dog beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a dog. And
what makes a horse beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a horse. What
then makes a man beautiful? Is it not the possession of the excellence of a
man? And do you, then, if you wish to be beautiful, young man, labour at this,
the acquisition of human excellence. But what is this? Observe whom you
yourself praise, when you praise many persons without partiality: do you praise
the just or the unjust? "The just." Whether do you praise the moderate or the
immoderate? "The moderate." And the temperate or the intemperate? "The
temperate." If, then, you make yourself such a person, you will know that you
will make yourself beautiful: but so long as you neglect these things, you must
be ugly, even though you contrive all you can to appear beautiful.
    Further I do not know what to say to you: for if I say to you what I think,
I shall offend you, and you will perhaps leave the school and not return to it:
and if I do not say what I think, see how I shall be acting, if you come to me
to be improved, and I shall not improve you at all, and if you come to me as to
a philosopher, and I shall say nothing to you as a philosopher. And how cruel
it is to you to leave you uncorrected. If at any time afterward you shall
acquire sense, you will with good reason blame me and say, "What did Epictetus
observe in me that, when he saw me in such a plight coming to him in such a
scandalous condition, he neglected me and never said a word? did he so much
despair of me? was I not young? was I not able to listen to reason? and how
many other young men at this age commit many like errors? I hear that a certain
Polemon from being a most dissolute youth underwent such a great change. Well,
suppose that he did not think that I should be a Polemon; yet he might have set
my hair right, he might have stripped off my decorations, he might have stopped
me from plucking the hair out of my body; but when he saw me dressed like- what
shall I say?- he kept silent." I do not say like what; but you will say, when
you come to your senses and shall know what it is and what persons use such a
dress.
    If you bring this charge against me hereafter, what defense shall I make?
Why, shall I say that the man will not be persuaded by me? Was Laius persuaded
by Apollo? Did he and get drunk and show no care for the oracle? Well then, for
this reason did Apollo refuse to tell him the truth? I indeed do not know,
whether you will be persuaded by me or not; but Apollo knew most certainly that
Laius would not be persuaded and yet he spoke. But why did he speak? I say in
reply: But why is he Apollo, and why does he deliver oracles, and why has he
fixed himself in this place as a prophet and source of truth and for the
inhabitants of the world to resort to him? and why are the words "Know
yourself" written in front of the temple, though no person takes any notice of
them?
    Did Socrates persuade all his hearers to take care of themselves? Not the
thousandth part. But, however, after he had been placed in this position by the
deity, as he himself says, he never left it. But what does he say even to his
judges? "If you acquit me on these conditions that I no longer do that which I
do now, I will not consent and I will not desist; but I will go up both to
young and to old, and, to speak plainly, to every man whom I meet, and I will
ask the questions which I ask now; and most particularly will I do this to you
my fellow-citizens, because you are more nearly related to me." Are you so
curious, Socrates, and such a busybody? and how does it concern you how we act?
and what is it that you say? "Being of the same community and of the same kin,
you neglect yourself, and show yourself a bad citizen to the state, and a bad
kinsman to your kinsmen, and a bad neighbor to your neighbors." "Who, then are
you?" Here it is a great thing to say, "I am he whose duty it is to take care
of men; for it is not every little heifer which dares to resist a lion; but if
the bull comes up and resists him, say to the bull, if you choose, 'And who are
you, and what business have you here?'" Man, in every kind there is produced
something which excels; in oxen, in dogs, in bees, in horses. Do not then say
to that which excels, "Who, then, are you?" If you do, it will find a voice in
some way and say, "I am such a thing as the purple in a garment: do not expect
me to be like the others, or blame my nature that it has made me different from
the rest of men."
    What then? am I such a man? Certainly not. And are you such a man as can
listen to the truth? I wish you were. But however since in a manner I have been
condemned to wear a white beard and a cloak, and you come to me as to a
philosopher, I will not treat you in a cruel way nor yet as if I despaired of
you, but I will say: Young man, whom do you wish to make beautiful? In the
first place, know who you are and then adorn yourself appropriately. You are a
human being; and this is a mortal animal which has the power of using
appearances rationally. But what is meant by "rationally?" Conformably to
nature and completely. What, then, do you possess which is peculiar? Is it the
animal part? No. Is it the condition of mortality? No. Is it the power of using
appearances? No. You possess the rational faculty as a peculiar thing: adorn
and beautify this; but leave your hair to him who made it as he chose. Come,
what other appellations have you? Are you man or woman? "Man." Adorn yourself
then as man, not as woman. Woman is naturally smooth and delicate; and if she
has much hair (on her body), she is a monster and is exhibited at Rome among
monsters. And in a man it is monstrous not to have hair; and if he has no hair,
he is a monster; but if he cuts off his hairs and plucks them out, what shall
we do with him? where shall we exhibit him? and under what name shall we show
him? "I will exhibit to you a man who chooses to be a woman rather than a man."
What a terrible sight! There is no man who will not wonder at such a notice.
Indeed I think that the men who pluck out their hairs do what they do without
knowing what they do. Man what fault have you to find with your nature? That it
made you a man? What then? was it fit that nature should make all human
creatures women? and what advantage in that case would you have had in being
adorned? for whom would you have adorned yourself, if all human creatures were
women? But you are not pleased with the matter: set to work then upon the whole
business. Take away- what is its name?- that which is the cause of the hairs:
make yourself a woman in all respects, that we may not be mistaken: do not make
one half man, and the other half woman. Whom do you wish to please? The women?,
Please them as a man. "Well; but they like smooth men." Will you not hang
yourself? and if women took delight in catamites, would you become one? Is this
your business? were you born for this purpose, that dissolute women should
delight in you? Shall we make such a one as you a citizen of Corinth and
perchance a prefect of the city, or chief of the youth, or general or
superintendent of the games? Well, and when you have taken a wife, do you
intend to have your hairs plucked out? To please whom and for what purpose? And
when you have begotten children, will you introduce them also into the state
with the habit of plucking their hairs? A beautiful citizen, and senator and
rhetorician. We ought to pray that such young men be born among us and brought
up.
    Do not so, I entreat you by the Gods, young man: but when you have once
heard these words, go away and say to yourself, "Epictetus has not said this to
me; for how could he? but some propitious good through him: for it would never
have come into his thoughts to say this, since he is not accustomed to talk
thus with any person. Come then let us obey God, that we may not be subject to
his anger." You say, "No." But, if a crow by his croaking signifies anything to
you, it is not the crow which signifies, but God through the crow; and if he
signifies anything through a human voice, will he not cause the man to say this
to you, that you may know the power of the divinity, that he signifies to some
in this way, and to others in that way, and concerning the greatest things and
the chief he signifies through the noblest messenger? What else is it which the
poet says:
       For we ourselves have warned him, and have sent
       Hermes the careful watcher, Argus' slayer,
       The husband not to kill nor wed the wife.
    Was Hermes going to descend from heaven to say this to him? And now the
Gods say this to you and send the messenger, the slayer of Argus, to warn you
not to pervert that which is well arranged, nor to busy yourself about it, but
to allow a man to be a man, and a woman to be a woman, a beautiful man to be as
a beautiful man, and an ugly man as an ugly man, for you are not flesh and
hair, but you are will; and if your will beautiful, then you will be beautiful.
But up the present time I dare not tell you that you are ugly, for I think that
you are readier to hear anything than this. But see what Socrates says to the
most beautiful and blooming of men Alcibiades: "Try, then, to be beautiful."
What does he say to him? "Dress your hair and pluck the hairs from your legs."
Nothing of that kind. But "Adorn your will, take away bad opinions." "How with
the body?" Leave it as it is by nature. Another has looked after these things:
intrust them to him. "What then, must a man be uncleaned?" Certainly not; but
what you are and are made by nature, cleanse this. A man should be cleanly as a
man, a woman as a woman, a child as a child. You say no: but let us also pluck
out the lion's mane, that he may not be uncleaned, and the cock's comb for he
also ought to he cleaned. Granted, but as a cock, and the lion as a lion, and
the hunting dog as a hunting dog.

Chapter 2

In what a man ought to be exercised who has made proficiency; and that we
                           neglect the chief things

    There are three things in which a man ought to exercise himself who would
be wise and good. The first concerns the desires and the aversions, that a man
may not fail to get what he desires, and that he may not fall into that which
he does not desire. The second concerns the movements (toward) and the
movements from an object, and generally in doing what a man ought to do, that
he may act according to order, to reason, and not carelessly. The third thing
concerns freedom from deception and rashness in judgement, and generally it
concerns the assents. Of these topics the chief and the most urgent is that
which relates to the affects; for an affect is produced in no other way than by
a failing to obtain that which a man desires or a falling into that which a man
would wish to avoid. This is that which brings in perturbations, disorders, bad
fortune, misfortunes, sorrows, lamentations and envy; that which makes men
envious and jealous; and by these causes we are unable even to listen to the
precepts of reason. The second topic concerns the duties of a man; for I ought
not to be free from affects like a statue, but I ought to maintain the
relations natural and acquired, as a pious man, as a son, as a father, as a
citizen.
    The third topic is that which immediately concerns those who are making
proficiency, that which concerns the security of the other two, so that not
even in sleep any appearance unexamined may surprise us, nor in intoxication,
nor in melancholy. "This," it may be said, "is above our power." But the
present philosophers neglecting the first topic and the second, employ
themselves on the third, using sophistical arguments, making conclusions from
questioning, employing hypotheses, lying. "For a man must," as it is said,
"when employed on these matters, take care that he is not deceived." Who must?
The wise and good man. This then is all that is wanting to you. Have you
successfully worked out the rest? Are you free from deception in the matter of
money? If you see a beautiful girl, do you resist the appearance? If your
neighbor obtains an estate by will, are you not vexed? Now is there nothing
else wanting to you except unchangeable firmness of mind? Wretch, you hear
these very things with fear and anxiety that some person may despise you, and
with inquiries about what any person may say about you. And if a man come and
tell you that in a certain conversation in which the question was, "Who is the
best philosopher," a man who was present said that a certain person was the
chief philosopher, your little soul which was only a finger's length stretches
out to two cubits. But if another who is present "You are mistaken; it is not
worth while to listen to a certain person, for what does he know? he has only
the first principles, and no more?" then you are confounded, you grow pale, you
cry out immediately, "I will show him who I am, that I am a great philosopher."
It is seen by these very things: why do you wish to show it by others? Do you
not know that Diogenes pointed out one of the sophists in this way by
stretching out his middle finger? And then when the man was wild with rage,
"This," he said, "is the certain person: I pointed him out to you." For a man
is not shown by the finger, as a stone or a piece of wood: but when any person
shows the man s principles, then he shows him as a man.
    Let us look at your principles also. For is it not plain that you value not
at all your own will, but you look externally to things which are independent
of your will? For instance, what will a certain person say? and what will
people think of you? will you be considered a man of learning; have you read
Chrysippus or Antipater? for if you have read Archedemus also, you have
everything. Why are you still uneasy lest you should not show us who you are?
Would you let me tell you what manner of man you have shown us that you are?
You have exhibited yourself to us as a mean fellow, querulous, passionate,
cowardly, finding fault with everything, blaming everybody, never quiet, vain:
this is what you have exhibited to us. Go away now and read Archedemus; then,
if a mouse should leap down and make a noise, you are a dead man. For such a
death awaits you as it did- what was the man's name?- Crinis; and he too was
proud, because he understood Archedemus.
    Wretch, will you not dismiss these things that do not concern you at all?
These things are suitable to those who are able to learn them without
perturbation, to those who can say: "I am not subject to anger, to grief, to
envy: I am not hindered, I am not restrained. What remains for me? I have
leisure, I am tranquil: let us see how we must deal with sophistical arguments;
let us see how when a man has accepted an hypothesis he shall not be led away
to anything absurd." To them such things belong. To those who are happy it is
appropriate to light a fire, to dine; if they choose, both to sing and to
dance. But when the vessel is sinking, you come to me and hoist the sails.

Chapter 3

What is the matter on which a good man should he employed, and in what we ought
                         chiefly to practice ourselves

    The material for the wise and good man is his own ruling faculty: and the
body is the material for the physician and the aliptes; the land is the matter
for the husbandman. The business of the wise and good man is to use appearances
conformably to nature: and as it is the nature of every soul to assent to the
truth, to dissent from the false, and to remain in suspense as to that which is
uncertain; so it is its nature to be moved toward the desire of the good, and
to aversion from the evil; and with respect to that which is neither good nor
bad it feels indifferent. For as the money-changer is not allowed to reject
Caesar's coin, nor the seller of herbs, but if you show the coin, whether he
chooses or not, he must give up what is sold for the coin; so it is also in the
matter of the soul. When the good appears, it immediately attracts to itself;
the evil repels from itself. But the soul will never reject the manifest
appearance of the good, any more than persons will reject Caesar's coin. On
this principle depends every movement both of man and God.
    For this reason the good is preferred to every intimate relationship. There
is no intimate relationship between me and my father, but there is between me
and the good. "Are you so hard-hearted?" Yes, for such is my nature; and this
is the coin which God has given me. For this reason, if the good is something
different from the beautiful and the just, both father is gone, and brother and
country, and everything. But shall I overlook my own good, in order that you
may have it, and shall I give it up to you? Why? "I am your father." But you
are not my good. "I am your brother." But you are not my good. But if we place
the good in a right determination of the will, the very observance of the
relations of life is good, and accordingly he who gives up any external things
obtains that which is good. Your father takes away your property. But he does
not injure you. Your brother will have the greater part of the estate in land.
Let him have as much as he chooses. Will he then have a greater share of
modesty, of fidelity, of brotherly affection? For who will eject you from this
possession? Not even Zeus, for neither has he chosen to do so; but he has made
this in my own power, and he has given it to me just as he possessed it
himself, free from hindrance, compulsion, and impediment. When then the coin
which another uses is a different coin, if a man presents this coin, he
receives that which is sold for it. Suppose that there comes into the province
a thievish proconsul, what coin does he use? Silver coin. Show it to him, and
carry off what you please. Suppose one comes who is an adulterer: what coin
does he use? Little girls. "Take," a man says, "the coin, and sell me the small
thing." "Give," says the seller, "and buy." Another is eager to possess boys.
Give him the coin, and receive what you wish. Another is fond of hunting: give
him a fine nag or a dog. Though he groans and laments, he will sell for it that
which you want. For another compels him from within, he who has fixed this
coin.
    Against this kind of thing chiefly a man should exercise himself. As soon
as you go out in the morning, examine every man whom you see, every man whom
you hear; answer as to a question, "What have you seen?" A handsome man or
woman? Apply the rule: Is this independent of the will, or dependent?
Independent. Take it away. What have you seen? A man lamenting over the death
of a child. Apply the rule. Death is a thing independent of the will. Take it
away. Has the proconsul met you? Apply the rule. What kind of thing is a
proconsul's office? Independent of the will, or dependent on it? Independent.
Take this away also: it does not stand examination: cast it away: it is nothing
to you.
    If we practiced this and exercised ourselves in it daily from morning to
night, something indeed would be done. But now we are forthwith caught
half-asleep by every appearance, and it is only, if ever, that in the school we
are roused a little. Then when we go out, if we see a man lamenting, we say,
"He is undone." If we see a consul, we say, "He is happy." If we see an exiled
man, we say, "He is miserable." If we see a poor man, we say, "He is wretched:
he has nothing to eat."
    We ought then to eradicate these bad opinions, and to this end we should
direct all our efforts. For what is weeping and lamenting? Opinion. What is bad
fortune? Opinion. What is civil sedition, what is divided opinion, what is
blame, what is accusation, what is impiety, what is trifling? All these things
are opinions, and nothing more, and opinions about things independent of the
will, as if they were good and bad. Let a man transfer these opinions to things
dependent on the will, and I engage for him that he will be firm and constant,
whatever may be the state of things around him. Such as is a dish of water,
such is the soul. Such as is the ray of light which falls on the water, such
are the appearances. When the water is moved, the ray also seems to be moved,
yet it is not moved. And when, then, a man is seized with giddiness, it is not
the arts and the virtues which are confounded, but the spirit on which they are
impressed; but if the spirit be restored to its settled state, those things
also are restored.

Chapter 4

Against a person who showed his partisanship in an unseemly way in a theatre

    The governor of Epirus having shown his favor to an actor in an unseemly
way and being publicly blamed on this account, and afterward having reported to
Epictetus that he was blamed and that he was vexed at those who blamed him,
Epictetus said: What harm have they been doing? These men also were acting, as
partisans, as you were doing. The governor replied, "Does, then, any person
show his partisanship in this way?" When they see you, said Epictetus, who are
their governor, a friend of Caesar and his deputy, showing partisanship in this
way, was it not to be expected that they also should show their partisanship in
the same way? for if it is not right to show partisanship in this way, do not
do so yourself; and if it is right, why are you angry if they followed your
example? For whom have the many to imitate except you, who are their superiors,
to whose example should they look when they go to the theatre except yours?
"See how the deputy of Caesar looks on: he has cried out, and I too, then, will
cry out. He springs up from his seat, and I will spring up. His slaves sit in
various parts of the theatre and call out. I have no slaves, but I will myself
cry out as much as I can and as loud as all of them together." You ought then
to know when you enter the theatre that you enter as a rule and example to the
rest how they ought to look at the acting. Why then did they blame you? Because
every man hates that which is a hindrance to him. They wished one person to be
crowned; you wished another. They were a hindrance to you, and you were a
hindrance to them. You were found to be the stronger; and they did what they
could; they blamed that which hindered them. What, then, would you have? That
you should do what you please, and they should not even say what they please?
And what is the wonder? Do not the husbandmen abuse Zeus when they are hindered
by him? do not the sailors abuse him? do they ever cease abusing Caesar? What
then does not Zeus know? is not what is said reported to Caesar? What, then,
does he do? he knows that, if he punished all who abuse him, he would have
nobody to rule over. What then? when you enter the theatre, you ought to say
not, "Let Sophron be crowned", but you ought to say this, "Come let me maintain
my will in this matter so that it shall be conformable to nature: no man is
dearer to me than myself. It would be ridiculous, then, for me to be hurt
(injured) in order that another who is an actor may be crowned." Whom then do I
wish to gain the prize? Why the actor who does gain the prize; and so he will
always gain the prize whom I wish to gain it. "But I wish Sophron to be
crowned." Celebrate as many games as you choose in your own house, Nemean,
Pythian, Isthmian, Olympian, and proclaim him victor. But in public do not
claim more than your due, nor attempt to appropriate to yourself what belongs
to all. If you do not consent to this, bear being abused: for when you do the
same as the many, you put yourself on the same level with them.

Chapter 5

Against those who on account of sickness go away home

    "I am sick here," said one of the pupils, "and I wish to return home." At
home, I suppose, you free from sickness. Do you not consider whether you are
doing, anything here which may be useful to the exercise of your will, that it
may be corrected? For if you are doing nothing toward this end, it was to no
purpose that you came. Go away. Look after your affairs at home. For if your
ruling power cannot be maintained in a state conformable to nature, it is
possible that your land can, that you will he able to increase your money, you
will take care of your father in his old age, frequent the public place, hold
magisterial office: being bad you will do badly anything else that you have to
do. But if you understand yourself, and know that you are casting away certain
bad opinions and adopting others in their place, and if you have changed your
state of life from things which are not within your will to things which are
within your will, and if you ever say, "Alas!" you are not saying what you say
on account of your father, or your brother, but on account of yourself, do you
still allege your sickness? Do you not know that both disease and death must
surprise us while we are doing something? the husbandman while he is tilling
the ground, the sailor while he is on his voyage? what would you be doing when
death surprises you, for you must be surprised when you are doing something? If
you can be doing anything better than this when you are surprised, do it. For I
wish to be surprised by disease or death when I am looking after nothing else
than my that may be free from perturbation, own will that I may be free from
hindrance, free from compulsion, and in a state of liberty. I wish to be found
practicing these things that I may be able to say to God, "Have I in any
respect transgressed thy commands? have I in any respect wrongly used the
powers which Thou gavest me? have I misused my perceptions or my
preconceptions? have I ever blamed Thee? have I ever found fault with Thy
administration? I have been sick, because it was Thy will, and so have others,
but I was content to be sick. I have been poor because it was Thy will, but I
was content also. I have not filled a magisterial office, because it was not
Thy pleasure that I should: I have never desired it. Hast Thou ever seen me for
this reason discontented? have I not always approached Thee with a cheerful
countenance, ready to do Thy commands and to obey Thy signals? Is it now Thy
will that I should depart from the assemblage of men? I depart. I give Thee all
thanks that Thou hast allowed me to join in this Thy assemblage of men and to
see Thy works, and to comprehend this Thy administration." May death surprise
me while I am thinking of these things, while I am thus writing and reading.
    "But my mother will not hold my head when I am sick." Go to your mother
then; for you are a fit person to have your head held when you are sick. "But
at home I used to lie down on a delicious bed." Go away to your bed: indeed you
are fit to lie on such a bed even when you are in health: do not, then, lose
what you can do there.
    But what does Socrates say? "As one man," he says, "is pleased with
improving his land, another with improving his horse, so I am daily pleased in
observing that I am growing better." "Better in what? in using nice little
words?" Man, do not say that. "In little matters of speculation?" What are you
saying? "And indeed I do not see what else there is on which philosophers
employ their time." Does it seem nothing to you to have never found fault with
any person, neither with God nor man? to have blamed nobody? to carry the same
face always in going out and coming in? This is what Socrates knew, and yet he
never said that he knew anything or taught anything. But if any man asked for
nice little words or little speculations, he would carry him to Protagoras or
to Hippias; and if any man came to ask for pot-herbs, he would carry him to the
gardener. Who then among you has this purpose? for if indeed you had it, you
would both be content in sickness, and in hunger, and in death. If any among
you has been in love with a charming girl, he knows that I say what is true.

Chapter 6

Miscellaneous

    When some person asked him how it happened that since reason has been more
cultivated by the men of the present age, the progress made in former times was
greater. In what respect, he answered, has it been more cultivated now, and in
what respect was the progress greater then? For in that in which it has now
been more cultivated, in that also the progress will now be found. At present
it has been cultivated for the purpose of resolving syllogisms, and progress is
made. But in former times it was cultivated for the purpose of maintaining the
governing faculty in a condition conformable to nature, and progress was made.
Do not, then, mix things which are different and do not expect, when you are
laboring at one thing, to make progress in another. But see if any man among us
when he is intent see I upon this, the keeping himself in a state conformable
to nature and living so always, does not make progress. For you will not find
such a man.
    The good man is invincible, for he does not enter the contest where he is
not stronger. If you want to have his land and all that is on it, take the
land; take his slaves, take his magisterial office, take his poor body. But you
will not make his desire fail in that which it seeks, nor his aversion fall
into that which he would avoid. The only contest into which he enters is that
about things which are within the power of his will; how then will he not be
invincible?
    Some person having asked him what is Common sense, Epictetus replied: As
that may be called a certain Common hearing which only distinguishes vocal
sounds, and that which distinguishes musical sounds is not Common, but
artificial; so there are certain things which men, who are not altogether
perverted, see by the common notions which all possess. Such a constitution of
the mind is named Common sense.
    It is not easy to exhort weak young men; for neither is it easy to hold
cheese with a hook. But those who have a good natural disposition, even if you
try to turn them aside, cling still more to reason. Wherefore Rufus generally
attempted to discourage, and he used this method as a test of those who had a
good natural disposition and those who had not. "For," it was his habit to say,
"as a stone, if you cast it upward, will be brought down to the earth by its
own nature, so the man whose mind is naturally good, the more you repel him,
the more he turns toward that to which he is naturally inclined."

Chapter 7

To the administrator of the free cities who was an Epicurean

    When the administrator came to visit him, and the man was an Epicurean,
Epictetus said: It is proper for us who are not philosophers to inquire of you
who are philosophers, as those who come to a strange city inquire of the
citizens and those who are acquainted with it, what is the best thing in the
world, in order that we also, after inquiry, may go in quest of that which is
best and look at it, as strangers do with the things in cities. For that there
are three things which relate to man, soul, body, and things external, scarcely
any man denies. It remains for you philosophers to answer what is the best.
What shall we say to men? Is the flesh the best? and was it for this that
Maximus sailed as far as Cassiope in winter with his son, and accompanied him
that he might be gratified in the flesh? Then the man said that it was not, and
added, "Far be that from him." Is it not fit then, Epictetus said, to be
actively employed about the best? "It is certainly of all things the most fit."
What, then, do we possess which is better than the flesh? "The soul," he
replied. And the good things of the best, are they better, or the good things
of the worse? "The good things of the best." And are the good things of the
best within the power of the will or not within the power of the will? "They
are within the power of the will." Is, then, the pleasure of the soul a thing
within the power of the will? "It is," he replied. And on what shall this
pleasure depend? On itself? But that cannot be conceived: for there must first
exist a certain substance or nature of good, by obtaining which we shall have
pleasure in the soul. He assented to this also. On what, then, shall we depend
for this pleasure of the soul? for if it shall depend on things of the soul,
the substance of the good is discovered; for good cannot be one thing, and that
at which we are rationally delighted another thing; nor if that which precedes
is not good, can that which comes after be good, for in order that the thing
which comes after may be good, that which precedes must be good. But you would
not affirm this, if you are in your right mind, for you would then say what is
inconsistent both with Epicurus and the rest of your doctrines. It remains,
then, that the pleasure of the soul is in the pleasure from things of the body:
and again that those bodily things must be the things which precede and the
substance of the good.
    For this reason Maximus acted foolishly if he made the voyage for any other
reason than for the sake of the flesh, that is, for the sake of the best. And
also a man acts foolishly if he abstains from that which belongs to others,
when he is a judge and able to take it. But, if you please, let us consider
this only, how this thing may be done secretly, and safely, and so that no man
will know it. For not even does Epicurus himself declare stealing to be bad,
but he admits that detection is; and because it is impossible to have security
against detection, for this reason he says, "Do not steal." But I say to you
that if stealing is done cleverly and cautiously, we shall not be detected:
further also we have powerful friends in Rome both men and women, and the
Hellenes are weak, and no man will venture to go up to Rome for the purpose.
Why do you refrain from your own good? This is senseless, foolish. But even if
you tell me that you do refrain, I will not believe you. For as it is
impossible to assent to that which appears false, and to turn away from that
which is true, so it is impossible to abstain from that which appears good. But
wealth is a good thing, and certainly most efficient in producing pleasure. Why
will you not acquire wealth? And why should we not corrupt our neighbor's wife,
if we can do it without detection? and if the husband foolishly prates about
the matter, why not pitch him out of the house? If you would be a philosopher
such as you ought to be, if a perfect philosopher, if consistent with your own
doctrines. If you would not, you will not differ at all from us who are called
Stoics; for we also say one thing, but we do another: we talk of the things
which are beautiful, but we do what is base. But you will be perverse in the
contrary way, teaching what is bad, practicing what is good.
    In the name of God, are you thinking of a city of Epicureans? "I do not
marry." "Nor I, for a man ought not to marry; nor ought we to beget children,
nor engage in public matters." What then will happen? whence will the citizens
come? who will bring them up? who will be governor of the youth, who preside wi
over gymnastic exercises? and in what also will the teacher instruct them? will
he teach them what the Lacedaemonians were taught, or what the Athenians were
taught? Come take a young man, bring him up according to your doctrines. The
doctrines are bad, subversive of a state, pernicious to families, and not
becoming to women. Dismiss them, man. You live in a chief city: it is your duty
to be a magistrate, to judge justly, to abstain from that which belongs to
others; no woman ought to seem beautiful to you except your own wife, and no
youth, no vessel of silver, no vessel of gold. Seek for doctrines which are
consistent with what I say, and, by making them your guide, you will with
pleasure abstain from things which have such persuasive power to lead us and
overpower us. But if to the persuasive power of these things, we also devise
such a philosophy as this which helps to push us on toward them and strengthens
us to this end, what will be the consequence? In a piece of toreutic art which
is the best part? the silver or the workmanship? The substance of the hand is
the flesh; but the work of the hand is the principal part. The duties then are
also three; those which are directed toward the existence of a thing; those
which are directed toward its existence in a particular kind; and third, the
chief or leading things themselves. So also in man we ought not to value the
material, the poor flesh, but the principal. What are these? Engaging in public
business, marrying, begetting children, venerating God, taking care of parents,
and, generally, having desires, aversions, pursuits of things and avoidances,
in the way in which we ought to do these things, and according to our nature.
And how are we constituted by nature? Free, noble, modest: for what other
animal blushes? what other is capable of receiving the appearance of shame? and
we are so constituted by nature as to subject pleasure to these things, as a
minister, a servant, in order that it may call forth our activity, in order
that it may keep us constant in acts which are conformable to nature.
    "But I am rich and I want nothing." Why, then, do you pretend to be a
philosopher? Your golden and your silver vessels are enough for you. What need
have you of principles? "But I am also a judge of the Greeks." Do you know how
to judge? Who taught you to know? "Caesar wrote to me a codicil." Let him write
and give you a commission to judge of music; and what will be the use of it to
you? Still how did you become a judge? whose hand did you kiss? the hand of
Symphorus or Numenius? Before whose bedchamber have you slept? To whom have you
sent gifts? Then do you not see that to be a judge is just of the same value as
Numenius is? "But I can throw into prison any man whom I please." So you can do
with a stone. "But I can beat with sticks whom I please." So you may an ass.
This is not a governing of men. Govern us as rational animals: show us what is
profitable to us, and we will follow it: show us what is unprofitable, and we
will turn away from it. Make us imitators of yourself, as Socrates made men
imitators of himself. For he was like a governor of men, who made them subject
to him their desires, their aversion, their movements toward an object and
their turning away from it. "Do this: do not do this: if you do not obey, I
will throw you into prison." This is not governing men like rational animals.
But I: As Zeus has ordained, so act: if you do not act so, you will feel the
penalty, you will be punished. What will be the punishment? Nothing else than
not having done your duty: you will lose the character of fidelity, modesty,
propriety. Do not look for greater penalties than these.

Chapter 9

To a certain rhetorician who was going up to Rome on a suit

    When a certain person came to him, who was going up to Rome on account of a
suit which had regard to his rank, Epictetus inquired the reason of his going
to Rome, and the man then asked what he thought about the matter. Epictetus
replied: If you ask me what you will do in Rome, whether you will succeed or
fall, I have no rule about this. But if you ask me how you will fare, I can
tell you: if you have right opinions, you will fare well; if they are false,
you will fare ill. For to every man the cause of his acting is opinion. For
what is the reason why you desired to be elected governor of the Cnossians?
Your opinion. What is the reason that you are now going up to Rome? Your
opinion. And going in winter, and with danger and expense. "I must go." What
tells you this? Your opinion. Then if opinions are the causes of all actions,
and a man has bad opinions, such as the cause may be, such also is the effect.
Have we then all sound opinions, both you and your adversary? And how do you
differ? But have you sounder opinions than your adversary? Why? You think so.
And so does he think that his opinions are better; and so do madmen. This is a
bad criterion. But show to me that you have made some inquiry into your
opinions and have taken some pains about them. And as now you are sailing to
Rome in order to become governor of the Cnossians, and you are not content to
stay at home with the honors which you had, but you desire something greater
and more conspicuous, so when did you ever make a voyage for the purpose of
examining your own opinions, and casting them out, if you have any that are
bad? Whom have you approached for this purpose? What time have you fixed for
it? What age? Go over the times of your life by yourself, if you are ashamed of
me. When you were a boy, did you examine your own opinions? and did you not
then, as you do all things now, do as you did do? and when you were become a
youth and attended the rhetoricians, and yourself practiced rhetoric, what did
you imagine that you were deficient in? And when you were a young man and
engaged in public matters, and pleaded causes yourself, and were gaining
reputation, who then seemed your equal? And when would you have submitted to
any man examining and show that your opinions are bad? What, then, do you wish
me to say to you? "Help me in this matter." I have no theorem (rule) for this.
Nor have you, if you came to me for this purpose, come to me as a philosopher,
but as to a seller of vegetables or a shoemaker. "For what purpose then have
philosophers theorems?" For this purpose, that whatever may happen, our ruling
faculty may be and continue to be conformable to nature. Does this seem to you
a small thing? "No; but the greatest." What then? does it need only a short
time? and is it possible to seize it as you pass by? If you can, seize it.
    Then you will say, "I met with Epictetus as I should meet with a stone or a
statue": for you saw me, and nothing more. But he meets with a man as a man,
who learns his opinions, and in his turn shows his own. Learn my opinions: show
me yours; and then say that you have visited me. Let us examine one another: if
I have any bad opinion, take it away; if you have any, show it. This is the
meaning of meeting with a philosopher. "Not so, but this is only a passing
visit, and while we are hiring the vessel, we can also see Epictetus. Let us
see what he says." Then you go away and say: "Epictetus was nothing: he used
solecisms and spoke in a barbarous way." For of what else do you come as
judges? "Well, but a man may say to me, "If I attend to such matters, I shall
have no land, as you have none; I shall have no silver cups as you have none,
nor fine beasts as you have none." In answer to this it is perhaps sufficient
to say: I have no need of such things: but if you possess many things you have
need of others: whether you choose or not, you are poorer than I am. "What then
have I need of?" Of that which you have not: of firmness, of a mind which is
conformable to nature, of being free from perturbation. Whether I have a patron
or not, what is that to me? but it is something to you. I am richer than you: I
am not anxious what Caesar will think of me: for this reason, I flatter no man.
This is what I possess instead of vessels of silver and gold. You have utensils
of gold; but your discourse, your opinions, your assents, your movements, your
desires are of earthen ware. But when I have these things conformable to
nature, why should I not employ my studies also upon reason? for I have
leisure: my mind is not distracted. What shall I do, since I have no
distraction? What more suitable to a man have I than this? When you have
nothing to do, you are disturbed, you go to the theatre or you wander about
without a purpose. Why should not the philosopher labour to improve his reason?
You employ yourself about crystal vessels: I employ myself about the syllogism
named "The Living": you about myrrhine vessels; I employ myself about the
syllogism named "The Denying." To you everything appears small that you
possess: to me all that I have appears great. Your desire is insatiable: mine
is satisfied. To (children) who put their hand into a narrow necked earthen
vessel and bring out figs and nuts, this happens; if they fill the hand, they
cannot take it out, and then they cry. Drop a few of them and you will draw
things out. And do you part with your desires: do not desire many things and
you will have what you want.

Chapter 10

In what manner we ought to bear sickness

    When the need of each opinion comes, we ought to have it in readiness: on
the occasion of breakfast, such as relate to breakfast; in the bath, those that
concern the bath; in bed, those that concern bed.
       Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes
       Before each daily action thou hast scann'd;
       What's done amiss, what done, what left undone;
       From first to last examine all, and then
       Blame what is wrong in what is right rejoice.
    And we ought to retain these verses in such way that we may use them, not
that we may utter them aloud, as when we exclaim "Paean Apollo." Again in fever
we should have ready such opinions as concern a fever; and we ought not, as
soon as the fever begins, to lose and forget all. (A man who has a fever) may
"If I philosophize any longer, may I be hanged: wherever I go, I must take care
of the poor body, that a fever may not come." But what is philosophizing? Is it
not a preparation against events which may happen? Do you not understand that
you are saying something of this kind? "If I shall still prepare myself to bear
with patience what happens, may I be hanged." But this is just as if a man
after receiving blows should give up the Pancratium. In the Pancratium it is in
our power to desist and not to receive blows. But in the other matter, we give
up philosophy, what shall we gain I gain? What then should a man say on the
occasion of each painful thing? "It was for this that I exercised myself, for
this I disciplined myself." God says to you, "Give me a proof that you have
duly practiced athletics, that you have eaten what you ought, that you have
been exercised, that you have obeyed the aliptes." Then do you show yourself
weak when the time for action comes? Now is the time for the fever. Let it be
borne well. Now is the time for thirst, well; now is the time for hunger, bear
it well. Is it not in your power? who shall hinder you? The physician will
hinder you from drinking; but he cannot prevent you from bearing thirst well:
and he will hinder you from eating; but he cannot prevent you from bearing
hunger well.
    "But I cannot attend to my philosophical studies." And for what purpose do
you follow them? Slave, is it not that you may be happy, that you may be
constant, is it not that you may be in a state conformable to nature and live
so? What hinders you when you have a fever from having your ruling faculty
conformable to nature? Here is the proof of the thing, here is the test of the
philosopher. For this also is a part of life, like walking, like sailing, like
journeying by land, so also is fever. Do you read when you are walking? No. Nor
do you when you have a fever. if you walk about well, you have all that belongs
to a man who walks. If you bear fever well, you have all that belongs to a man
in a fever. What is it to bear a fever well? Not to blame God or man; not to be
afflicted it that which happens, to expect death well and nobly, to do what
must be done: when the physician comes in, not to be frightened at what he
says; nor if he says, "You are doing well," to be overjoyed. For what good has
he told you? and when you were in health, what good was that to you? And even
if he says, "You are in a bad way," do not despond. For what is it to be ill?
is it that you are near the severance of the soul and the body? what harm is
there in this? If you are not near now, will you not afterward be near? Is the
world going to be turned upside down when you are dead? Why then do you flatter
the physician? Why do you say, "If you please, master, I shall be well"? Why do
you give him an opportunity of raising his eyebrows? Do you not value a
physician, as you do a shoemaker when he is measuring your foot, or a carpenter
when he is building your house, and so treat the physician as to the body which
is not yours, but by nature dead? He who has a fever has an opportunity of
doing this: if he does these things, he has what belongs to him. For it is not
the business of a philosopher to look after these externals, neither his wine
nor his oil nor his poor body, but his own ruling power. But as to externals
how must he act? so far as not to be careless about them. Where then is there
reason for fear? where is there, then, still reason for anger, and of fear
about what belongs to others, about things which are of no value? For we ought
to have these two principles in readiness: that except the will nothing is good
nor bad; and that we ought not to lead events, but to follow them. "My brother
ought not to have behaved thus to me." No; but he will see to that: and,
however he may behave, I will conduct myself toward him as I ought. For this is
my own business: that belongs to another; no man can prevent this, the other
thing can be hindered.

Chapter 11

Certain miscellaneous matters

    There are certain penalties fixed as by law for those who disobey the
divine administration. Whoever thinks any other thing to be good except those
things which depend on the will, let him envy, let him desire, let him flatter,
let him be perturbed: whoever considers anything else to be evil, let him
grieve, let him lament, let him weep, let him be unhappy. And yet, though so
severely punished, we cannot desist.
    Remember what the poet says about the stranger:
       Stranger, I must not, e'en if a worse man come.
This, then, may be applied even to a father: "I must not, even if a worse man
than you should come, treat a father unworthily-, for all are from paternal
Zeus." And of a brother, "For all are from the Zeus who presides over kindred."
And so in the other relations of life we shall find Zeus to be an inspector.

Chapter 12

About exercise

    We ought not to make our exercises consist in means contrary to nature and
adapted to cause admiration, for, if we do so, we, who call ourselves
philosophers, shall not differ at all from jugglers. For it is difficult even
to walk on a rope; and not only difficult, but it is also dangerous. Ought we
for this reason to practice walking on a rope, or setting up a palm tree, or
embracing statues? By no means. Everything, which is difficult and dangerous is
not suitable for practice; but that is suitable which conduces to the working
out of that which is proposed to us as a thing to be worked out. To live with
desire and aversion, free from restraint. And what is this? Neither to be
disappointed in that which you desire, nor to fall into anything which you
would avoid. Toward this object, then, exercise ought to tend. For, since it is
not possible to have your desire not disappointed and your aversion free from
falling into that which you would avoid, great and constant practice you must
know that if you allow your desire and aversion to turn to things which are not
within the power of the will, you will neither have your desire capable of
attaining your object, nor your aversion free from the power of avoiding that
which you would avoid. And since strong habit leads, and we are accustomed to
employ desire and aversion only to things which are not within the power of our
will, we ought to oppose to this habit a contrary habit, and where there is
great slipperiness in the appearances, there to oppose the habit of exercise.
    I am rather inclined to pleasure: I will incline to the contrary side above
measure for the sake of exercise. I am averse to pain: I will rub and exercise
against this the appearances which are presented to me for the purpose of
withdrawing my aversion from every such thing. For who is a practitioner in
exercise? He who practices not using his desire, and applies his aversion only
to things which are within the power of his will, and practices most in the
things which are difficult to conquer. For this reason one man must practice
himself more against one thing and another against another thing. What, then,
is it to the purpose to set up a palm tree, or to carry about a tent of skins,
or a mortar and a pestle? Practice, man, if you are irritable, to endure if you
are abused, not to be vexed if you are treated with dishonour. Then you will
make so much progress that, even if a man strikes you, you will say to
yourself, "Imagine that you have embraced a statue": then also exercise
yourself to use wine properly so as not to drink much, for in this also there
are men who foolishly practice themselves; but first of all you should abstain
from it, and abstain from a young girl and dainty cakes. Then at last, if
occasion presents itself, for the purpose of trying yourself at a proper time,
you will descend into the arena to know if appearances overpower you as they
did formerly. But at first fly far from that which is stronger than yourself:
the contest is unequal between a charming young girl and a beginner in
philosophy. "The earthen pitcher," as the saying is, "and the rock do not
agree."
    After the desire and the aversion comes the second topic of the movements
toward action and the withdrawals from it; that you may be obedient to reason,
that you do nothing out of season or place, or contrary to any propriety of the
kind. The third topic concerns the assents, which is related to the things
which are persuasive and attractive. For as Socrates said, "we ought not to
live a life without examination," so we ought not to accept an appearance
without examination, but we should say, "Wait, let me see what you are and
whence you come"; like the watch at night, "Show me the pass." "Have you the
signal from nature which the appearance that may be accepted ought to have?"
And finally whatever means are applied to the body by those who exercise it, if
they tend in any way toward desire and it, aversion, they also may be fit means
of exercise; but if they are for display, they are the indications of one who
has turned himself toward something external, and who is hunting for something
else, and who looks for spectators who will say, "Oh the great man." For this
reason, Apollonius said well, "When you intend to exercise yourself for your
own advantage, and you are thirsty from heat, take in a mouthful of cold water,
and spit it out, and tell nobody."

Chapter 13

What solitude is, and what kind of person a solitary man is

    Solitude is a certain condition of a helpless man. For because a man is
alone, he is not for that reason also solitary; just as though a man is among
numbers, he is not therefore not solitary. When then we have lost either a
brother, or a son, or a friend on whom we were accustomed to repose, we say
that we are left solitary, though we are often in Rome, though such a crowd
meet us, though so many live in the same place, and sometimes we have a great
number of slaves. For the man who is solitary, as it is conceived, is
considered to be a helpless person and exposed to those who wish to harm him.
For this reason when we travel, then especially do we say that we are lonely
when we fall among robbers, for it is not the sight of a human creature which
removes us from solitude, but the sight of one who is faithful and modest and
helpful to us. For if being alone is enough to make solitude, you may say that
even Zeus is solitary in the conflagration and bewails himself saying, "Unhappy
that I am who have neither Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son,
nor descendant nor kinsman." This is what some say that he does when he is
alone at the conflagration. For they do not understand how a man passes his
life when he is alone, because they set out from a certain natural principle,
from the natural desire of community and mutual love and from the pleasure of
conversation among men. But none the less a man ought to be prepared in a
manner for this also, to be able to be sufficient for himself and to be his own
companion. For as Zeus dwells with himself, and is tranquil by himself, and
thinks of his own administration and of its nature, and is employed in thoughts
suitable to himself; so ought we also to be able to talk with ourselves, not to
feel the want of others also, not to be unprovided with the means of passing
our time; to observe the divine administration and the relation of ourselves to
everything else; to consider how we formerly were affected toward things that
happen and how at present; what are still the things which give us pain; how
these also can be cured and how removed; if any things require improvement, to
improve them according to reason.
    For you see that Caesar appears to furnish us with great peace, that there
are no longer enemies nor battles nor great associations of robbers nor of
pirates, but we can travel at every hour and sail from east to west. But can
Caesar give us security from fever also, can he from shipwreck, from fire, from
earthquake or from lightning? well, I will say, can he give us security against
love? He cannot. From sorrow? He cannot. From envy? He cannot. In a word then
he cannot protect us from any of these things. But the doctrine of philosophers
promises to give us security even against these things. And what does it say?
"Men, if you will attend to me, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, you
will not feel sorrow, nor anger, nor compulsion, nor hindrance, but you will
pass your time without perturbations and free from everything." When a man has
this peace, not proclaimed by Caesar (for how should he be able to proclaim
it?), but by God through reason, is he not content when he is alone? when he
sees and reflects, "Now no evil can happen to me; for me there is no robber, no
earthquake, everything is full of peace, full of tranquillity: every way, every
city, every meeting, neighbor, companion is harmless. One person whose business
it is, supplies me with food; another with raiment; another with perceptions,
and preconceptions. And if he does not supply what is necessary, He gives the
signal for retreat, opens the door, and says to you, 'Go.' Go whither? To
nothing terrible, but to the place from which you came, to your friends and
kinsmen, to the elements: what there was in you of fire goes to fire; of earth,
to earth; of air, to air; of water to water: no Hades, nor Acheron, nor
Cocytus, nor Pyriphlegethon, but all is full of Gods and Demons." When a man
has such things to think on, and sees the sun, the moon and stars, and enjoys
earth and sea, he is not solitary nor even helpless. "Well then, if some man
should come upon me when I am alone and murder me?" Fool, not murder you, but
your poor body.
    What kind of solitude then remains? what want? why do we make ourselves
worse than children? and what do children do when they are left alone? They
take up shells and ashes, and they build something, then pull it down, and
build something else, and so they never want the means of passing the time.
Shall I, then, if you sail away, sit down and weep, because I have been left
alone and solitary? Shall I then have no shells, no ashes? But children do what
they do through want of thought, and we through knowledge are unhappy.
    Every great power is dangerous to beginners. You must then bear such things
as you are able, but conformably to nature: but not... Practice sometimes a way
of living like a man in health. Abstain from food, drink water, abstain
sometimes altogether from desire, in order that you may some time desire
consistently with reason; and if consistently with reason, when you have
anything good in you, you will desire well. "Not so; but we wish to live like
wise men immediately and to be useful to men." Useful how? what are you doing?
have you been useful to yourself? "But, I suppose, you wish to exhort them."
You exhort them! You wish to be useful to them. Show to them in your own
example what kind of men philosophy makes, and don't trifle. When you are
eating, do good to those who eat with you; when you are drinking, to those who
are drinking with you; by yielding to all, giving way, bearing with them, thus
do them good, and do not spit on them your phlegm.

Chapter 14

Certain miscellaneous matters

    As bad tragic actors cannot sing alone, but in company with many: so some
persons cannot walk about alone. Man, if you are anything, both walk alone and
talk to yourself, and do not hide yourself in the chorus. Examine a little at
last, look around, stir yourself up, that you may know who you are.
    When a man drinks water, or does anything for the sake of practice,
whenever there is an opportunity he tells it to all: "I drink water." Is it for
this that you drink water, for the purpose of drinking water? Man, if it is
good for you to drink, drink; but if not, you are acting ridiculously. But if
it is good for you and you do drink, say nothing about it to those who are
displeased with water-drinkers. What then, do you wish to please these very
men?
    Of things that are done some are done with a final purpose, some according
to occasion, others with a certain reference to circumstances, others for the
purpose of complying with others. and some according to a fixed scheme of life.
    You must root out of men these two things, arrogance and distrust.
Arrogance, then, is the opinion that you want nothing: but distrust is the
opinion that you cannot be happy when so many circumstances surround you.
Arrogance is removed by confutation; and Socrates was the first who practiced
this. And, that the thing is not impossible, inquire and seek. This search will
do you no harm; and in a manner this is philosophizing, to seek how it is
possible to employ desire and aversion without impediment.
    "I am superior to you, for my father is a man of consular rank." Another
says, "I have been a tribune, but you have not." If we were horses, would you
say, "My father was swifter?" "I have much barley and fodder, or elegant neck
ornaments." If, then, while you were saying this, I said, "Be it so: let us run
then." Well, is there nothing in a man such as running in a horse, by which it
will he known which is superior and inferior? Is there not modesty, fidelity,
justice? Show yourself superior in these, that you may be superior as a man. If
you tell me that you can kick violently, I also will say to you that you are
proud of that which is the act of an ass.

Chapter 15

That we ought to proceed with circumspection to everything

    In every act consider what precedes and what follows, and then proceed to
the act. If you do not consider, you will at first begin with spirit, since you
have not thought at all of the things which follow; but afterward, when some
consequences have shown themselves, you will basely desist. "I wish to conquer
at the Olympic games." "And I too, by the gods: for it is a fine thing." But
consider here what precedes and what follows; and then, if it is for your good,
undertake the thing. You must act according to rules, follow strict diet,
abstain from delicacies, exercise yourself by compulsion at fixed times, in
heat, in cold; drink no cold water, nor wine, when there is opportunity of
drinking it. In a word you must surrender yourself to the trainer as you do to
a physician. Next in the contest, you must be covered with sand, sometimes
dislocate a hand, sprain an ankle, swallow a quantity of dust, be scourged with
the whip; and after undergoing all this, you must sometimes be conquered. After
reckoning all these things, if you have still an inclination, go to the
athletic practice. If you do not reckon them, observe you behave like children
who at one time you wi play as wrestlers, then as gladiators, then blow a
trumpet, then act a tragedy, when they have seen and admired such things. So
you also do: you are at one time a wrestler, then a gladiator, then a
philosopher, then a rhetorician; but with your whole soul you are nothing: like
the ape, you imitate all that you see; and always one thing after another
pleases you, but that which becomes familiar displeases you. For you have never
undertaken anything after consideration, nor after having explored the whole
matter and put it to a strict examination; but you have undertaken it at hazard
and with a cold desire. Thus some persons having seen a philosopher and having
heard one speak like Euphrates- yet who can speak like him?- wish to be
philosophers themselves.
    Man, consider first what the matter is, then your own nature also, what it
is able to bear. If you are a wrestler, look at your shoulders, your thighs,
your loins: for different men are naturally formed for different things. Do you
think that, if you do, you can be a philosopher? Do you think that you can eat
as you do now, drink as you do now, and in the same way be angry and out of
humour? You must watch, labour, conquer certain desires, you must depart from
your kinsmen, be despised by your slave, laughed at by those who meet you, in
everything you must be in an inferior condition, as to magisterial office, in
honours, in courts of justice. When you have considered all these things
completely, then, if you think proper, approach to philosophy, if you would
gain in exchange for these things freedom from perturbations, liberty,
tranquillity. If you have not considered these things, do not approach
philosophy: do not act like children, at one time a philosopher, then a tax
collector, then a rhetorician, then a procurator of Caesar These things are not
consistent. You must be one man either good or bad: you must either labour at
your own ruling faculty or at external things: you must either labour at things
within or at external things: that is, you must either occupy the place of a
philosopher or that of one of the vulgar.
    A person said to Rufus when Galba was murdered, "Is the world now governed
by Providence?" But Rufus replied, "Did I ever incidentally form an argument
from Galba that the world is governed by Providence?"

Chapter 16

That we ought with caution to enter, into familiar intercourse with men

    If a man has frequent intercourse with others, either for talk, or drinking
together, or generally for social purposes, he must either become like them, or
change them to his own fashion. For if a man places a piece of quenched
charcoal close to a piece that is burning, either the quenched charcoal will
quench the other, or the burning charcoal will light that which is quenched.
Since, then, the danger is so great, we must cautiously enter into such
intimacies with those of the common sort, and remember that it is impossible
that a man can keep company with one who is covered with soot without being
partaker of the soot himself. For what will you do if a man speaks about
gladiators, about horses, about athletes, or, what is worse, about men? "Such a
person is bad," "Such a person is good": "This was well done," "This was done
badly." Further, if he scoff, or ridicule, or show an ill-natured disposition?
Is any man among us prepared like a lute-player when he takes a lute, so that
as soon as he has touched the strings, he discovers which are discordant, and
tunes the instrument? such a power as Socrates had who in all his social
intercourse could lead his companions to his own purpose? How should you have
this power? It is therefore a necessary consequence that you are carried about
by the common kind of people.
    Why, then, are they more powerful than you? Because they utter these
useless words from their real opinions: but you utter your elegant words only
from your lips; for this reason they are without strength and dead, and it is
nauseous to listen to your exhortations and your miserable virtue, which is
talked of everywhere. In this way the vulgar have the advantage over you: for
every opinion is strong and invincible. Until, then, the good sentiments are
fixed in you, and you shall have acquired a certain power for your security, I
advise you to be careful in your association with like wax in the sun there
will be melted away whatever you inscribe on your minds in the school.
Withdraw, then, yourselves far from the sun so long as you have these waxen
sentiments. For this reason also philosophers advise men to leave their native
country, because ancient habits distract them and do not allow a beginning to
be made of a different habit; nor can we tolerate those who meet us and say:
"See such a one is now a philosopher, who was once so-and-so." Thus also
physicians send those who have lingering diseases to a different country and a
different air; and they do right, Do you also introduce other habits than those
which you have: fix your opinions and exercise yourselves in them. But you do
not so: you go hence to a spectacle, to a show of gladiators, to a place of
exercise, to a circus; then you come back hither, and again from this place you
go to those places, and still the same persons. And there is no pleasing habit,
nor attention, nor care about self and observation of this kind, "How shall I
use the appearances presented to me? according to nature, or contrary to
nature? how do I answer to them? as I ought, or as I ought not? Do I say to
those things which are independent of the will, that they do not concern me?"
For if you are not yet in this state, fly from your former habits, fly from the
common sort, if you intend ever to begin to be something.

Chapter 17

On providence

    When you make any charge against Providence, consider, and you will learn
that the thing has happened according to reason. "Yes, but the unjust man has
the advantage." In what? "In money." Yes, for he is superior to you in this,
that he flatters, is free from shame, and is watchful. What is the wonder? But
see if he has the advantage over you in being faithful, in being modest: for
you will not find it to be so; but wherein you are superior, there you will
find that you have the advantage. And I once said to a man who was vexed
because Philostorgus was fortunate: "Would you choose to lie with Sura?" "May
it never happen," he replied, "that this day should come?" "Why then are you
vexed, if he receives something in return for that which he sells; or how can
you consider him happy who acquires those things by such means as you
abominate; or what wrong does Providence, if he gives the better things to the
better men? Is it not better to be modest than to be rich?" He admitted this.
Why are you vexed then, man, when you possess the better thing? Remember, then,
always, and have in readiness, the truth that this is a law of nature, that the
superior has an advantage over the inferior in that in which he is superior;
and you will never be vexed.
    "But my wife treats me badly." Well, if any man asks you what this is, say,
"My wife treats me badly." "Is there, then, nothing more?" Nothing. "My father
gives me nothing." But to say that this is an evil is something which must be
added to it externally, and falsely added. For this reason we must not get rid
of poverty, but of the opinion about poverty, and then we shall be happy.

Chapter 18

That we ought not to be disturbed by any news

    When anything shall be reported to you which is of a nature to disturb,
have this principle in readiness, that the news is about nothing which is
within the power of your will. Can any man report to you that you have formed a
bad opinion, or had a bad desire? By no means. But perhaps he will report that
some person is dead. What then is that to you? He may report that some person
speaks ill of you. What then is that to you? Or that your father is planning
something or other. Against whom? Against your will? How can he? But is it
against your poor body, against your little property? You are quite safe: it is
not against you. But the judge declares that you have committed an act of
impiety. And did not the judges make the same declaration against Socrates ?
Does it concern you that the judge has made this declaration? No. Why then do
you trouble yourself any longer about it? Your father has a certain duty, and
if he shall not fulfill it, he loses the character of a father, of a man of
natural affection, of gentleness. Do not wish him to lose anything else on this
account. For never does a man do wrong, in one thing, and suffer in another. On
the other side it is your duty to make your defense firmly, modestly, without
anger: but if you do not, you also lose the character of a son, of a man of
modest behavior, of generous character. Well then, is the judge free from
danger? No; but he also is in equal danger. Why then are you still afraid of
his decision? What have you to do with that which is another man's evil? It is
your own evil to make a bad defense: be on your guard against this only. But to
be condemned or not to be condemned, as that is the act of another person, so
it is the evil of another person. "A certain person threatens you." Me? No. "He
blames you." Let him see how he manages his own affairs. "He is going to
condemn you unjustly." He is a wretched man.

Chapter 19

What is the condition of a common kind of man and of a philosopher

    The first difference between a common person and a philosopher is this: the
common person says, "Woe to me for my little child, for my brother, for my
father." The philosopher, if he shall ever be compelled to say, "Woe to me,"
stops and says, "but for myself." For nothing which is independent of the will
can hinder or damage the will, and the will can only hinder or damage itself.
If, then, we ourselves incline in this direction, so as, when we are unlucky,
to blame ourselves and to remember that nothing else is the cause of
perturbation or loss of tranquillity except our own opinion, I swear to you by
all the gods that we have made progress. But in the present state of affairs we
have gone another way from the beginning. For example, while we were still
children, the nurse, if we ever stumbled through want of care, did not chide
us, but would beat the stone. But what did the stone do? Ought the stone to
have moved on account of your child's folly? Again, if we find nothing to eat
on coming out of the bath, the pedagogue never checks our appetite, but he
flogs the cook. Man, did we make you the pedagogue of the cook and not of the
child? Correct the child, improve him. In this way even when we are grown up we
are like children. For he who is unmusical is a child in music; he who is
without letters is a child in learning: he who is untaught, is a child in life.

Chapter 20

That we can derive advantage from all external things

    In the case of appearances, which are objects of the vision, nearly all
have allowed the good and the evil to be in ourselves, and not in externals. No
one gives the name of good to the fact that it is day, nor bad to the fact that
it is night, nor the name of the greatest evil to the opinion that three are
four. But what do men say? They say that knowledge is good, and that error is
bad; so that even in respect to falsehood itself there is a good result, the
knowledge that it is falsehood. So it ought to be in life also. "Is health a
good thing, and is sickness a bad thing" No, man. "But what is it?" To be
healthy, and healthy in a right way, is good: to be healthy in a bad way is
bad; so that it is possible to gain advantage even from sickness, I declare.
For is it not possible to gain advantage even from death, and is it not
possible to gain advantage from mutilation? Do you think that Menoeceus gained
little by death? "Could a man who says so, gain so much as Menoeceus gained?"
Come, man, did he not maintain the character of being a lover of his country, a
man of great mind, faithful, generous? And if he had continued to live, would
he not have lost all these things? would he not have gained the opposite? would
he not have gained the name of coward, ignoble, a hater of his country, a man
who feared death? Well, do you think that he gained little by dying? "I suppose
not." But did the father of Admetus gain much by prolonging his life so ignobly
and miserably? Did he not die afterward? Cease, I adjure you by the gods, to
admire things. Cease to make yourselves slaves, first of things, then on
account of things slaves of those who are able to give them or take them away.
    "Can advantage then be derived from these things." From all; and from him
who abuses you. Wherein does the man who exercises before the combat profit the
athlete? Very greatly. This man becomes my exerciser before the combat: he
exercises me in endurance, in keeping my temper, in mildness. You say no: but
he, who lays hold of my neck and disciplines my loins and shoulders, does me
good; and the exercise master does right when he says: "Raise him up with both
hands, and the heavier he is, so much the more is my advantage." But if a man
exercises me in keeping my, temper, does he not do good? This is not knowing
how to gain an advantage from men. "Is my neighbour bad?" Bad to himself, but
good to me: he exercises my good disposition, my moderation. "Is my father bad?
" Bad to himself, but to me good. This is the rod of Hermes: "Touch with it
what you please," as the saying is. "and it will be of gold." I say not so: but
bring what you please, and I will make it good. Bring disease, bring death,
bring poverty, bring abuse, bring trial on capital charges: all these things
through the rod of Hermes shall be made profitable. "What will you do with
death?" Why, what else than that it shall do you honour, or that it shall show
you by act through it, what a man is who follows the will of nature? "What will
you do with disease?" I will show its nature, I will be conspicuous in, it, I
will be firm, I will be happy, I will not flatter the physician, I will not
wish to die. What else do you seek? Whatever you shall give me, I will make it
happy, fortunate, honoured, a thing which a man shall seek.
    You say No: but take care that you do not fall sick: it is a bad thing."
This is the same as if you should say, "Take care that you never receive the
impression that three are four: that is bad." Man, how is it bad? If I think
about it as I ought, how shall it, then, do me any damage? and shall it not
even do me good? If, then, I think about poverty as I ought to do, about
disease, about not having office, is not that enough for me? will it not be an
advantage? How, then, ought I any longer to look to seek evil and good in
externals? What happens these doctrines are maintained here, but no man carries
them away home; but immediately every one is at war with his slave, with his
neighbours, with those who have sneered at him, with those who have ridiculed
him. Good luck to Lesbius, who daily proves that I know nothing.

Chapter 21

Against those who readily come to the profession of sophists

    They who have taken up bare theorems immediately wish to vomit them forth,
as persons whose stomach is diseased do with food. First digest the thing, then
do not vomit it up thus: f you do not digest it, the thing become truly an
emetic, a crude food and unfit to eat. But after digestion show us some chance
in your ruling faculty, as athletes show in their shoulders by what they have
been exercised and what they have eaten; as those who have taken up certain
arts show by what they have learned. The carpenter does not come and say, "Hear
me talk about the carpenter's art"; but having undertaken to build a house, he
makes it, and proves that he knows the art. You also ought to do something of
the kind; eat like a man, drink like a man, dress, marry, beget children, do
the office of a citizen, endure abuse, bear unreasonable brother, bear with
your father, bear with your son, neighbour, compassion. Show us these things
that we may see that you have in truth learned something from the philosophers.
You say, "No, but come and hear me read commentaries." Go away, and seek
somebody to vomit them on. "And indeed I will expound to you the writings of
Chrysippus as no other man can: I will explain his text most clearly: I will
add also, if I can, the vehemence of Antipater and Archedemus."
    Is it, then, for this that young men shall leave their country and their
parents, that they may come to this place, and hear you explain words? Ought
they not to return with a capacity to endure, to be active in association with
others, free from passions, free from perturbation, with such a provision for
the journey of life with which they shall be able to bear well the things that
happen and derive honour from them? And how can you give them any of these
things which you do not possess? Have you done from the beginning anything else
than employ yourself about the resolution of Syllogisms, of sophistical
arguments, and in those which work by questions? "But such a man has a school;
why should not I also have a school?" These things are not done, man, in a
careless way, nor just as it may happen; but there must be a (fit) age and life
and God as a guide. You say, "No." But no man sails from a port without having
sacrificed to the Gods and invoked their help; nor do men sow without having
called on Demeter; and shall a man who has undertaken so great a work undertake
it safely without the Gods? and shall they who undertake this work come to it
with success? What else are you doing, man, than divulging the mysteries? You
say, "There is a temple at Eleusis, and one here also. There is an Hierophant
at Eleusis, and I also will make an Hierophant: there is a herald, and I will
establish a herald; there is a torch-bearer at Eleusis, and I also will
establish a torch-bearer; there are torches at Eleusis, and I will have torches
here. The words are the same: how do the things done here differ from those
done there?" Most impious man, is there no difference? these things are done
both in due place and in due time; and when accompanied with sacrifice and
prayers, when a man is first purified, and when he is disposed in his mind to
the thought that he is going to approach sacred rites and ancient rites. In
this way the mysteries are useful, in this way we come to the notion that all
these things were established by the ancients for the instruction and
correction of life. But you publish and divulge them out of time, out of place,
without sacrifices, without purity; you have not the garments which the
hierophant ought to have, nor the hair, nor the head-dress, nor the voice, nor
the age; nor have you purified yourself as he has: but you have committed to
memory the words only, and you say: "Sacred are the words by themselves."
    You ought to approach these matters in another way; the thing is great, it
is mystical, not a common thing, nor is it given to every man. But not even
wisdom perhaps is enough to enable a man to take care of youths: a man must
have also a certain readiness and fitness for this purpose, and a certain
quality of body, and above all things he must have God to advise him to occupy
this office, as God advised Socrates to occupy the place of one who confutes
error, Diogenes the office of royalty and reproof, and the office of teaching
precepts. But you open a doctor's shop, though you have nothing except physic:
but where and how they should be applied, you know not nor have you taken any
trouble about it. "See," that man says, "I too have salves for the eyes." Have
you also the power of using them? Do you know both when and how they will do
good, and to whom they will do good? Why then do you act at hazard in things of
the greatest importance? why are you careless? why do you undertake a thing
that is in no way fit for you? Leave it to those who are able to do it, and to
do it well. Do not yourself bring disgrace on philosophy through your own acts,
and be not one of those who load it with a bad reputation. But if theorems
please you, sit still and turn them over by yourself; but never say that you
are a philosopher, nor allow another to say it; but say: "He is mistaken, for
neither are my desires different from what they were before, nor is my activity
directed to other objects, nor do I assent to other things, nor in the use of
appearances have I altered at all from my former condition." This you must
think and say about yourself, if you would think as you ought: if not, act at
hazard, and do what you are doing; for it becomes you.

Chapter 22

About cynicism

    When one of his pupils inquired of Epictetus, and he was a person who
appeared to be inclined to Cynism, what kind of person a Cynic ought to be and
what was the notion of the thing, We will inquire, said Epictetus, at leisure:
but I have so much to say to you that he who without God attempts so great a
matter, is hateful to God, and has no other purpose than to act indecently in
public. For in any well-managed house no man comes forward, and says to
himself, "I ought to be manager of the house." If he does so, the master turns
round and, seeing him insolently giving orders, drags him forth and flogs him.
So it is also in this great city; for here also there is a master of the house
who orders everything. "You are the sun; you can by going round make the year
and seasons, and make the fruits grow and nourish them, and stir the winds and
make them remit, and warm the bodies of men properly: go, travel round, and so
administer things from the greatest to the least." "You are a calf; when a lion
shall appear, do your proper business: if you do not, you will suffer." "You
are a bull: advance and fight, for this is your business, and becomes you, and
you can do it." "You can lead the army against Illium; be Agamemnon." "You can
fight in single combat against Hector: be Achilles." But if Thersites came
forward and claimed the command, he would either not have obtained it; or, if
he did obtain it, he would have disgraced himself before many witnesses.
    Do you also think about the matter carefully: it is not what it seems to
you. "I wear a cloak now and I shall wear it then: I sleep hard now, and I
shall sleep hard then: I will take in addition a little bag now and a staff,
and I will go about and begin to beg and to abuse those whom I meet; and if I
see any man plucking the hair out of his body, I will rebuke him, or if he has
dressed his hair, or if he walks about in purple." If you imagine the thing to
be such as this, keep far away from it: do not approach it: it is not at all
for you. But if you imagine it to be what it is, and do not think yourself to
be unfit for it, consider what a great thing you undertake.
    In the first place in the things which relate to yourself, you must not be
in any respect like what you do now: you must not blame God or man: you must
take away desire altogether, you must transfer avoidance only to the things
which are within the power of the will: you must not feel anger nor resentment
nor envy nor pity; a girl must not appear handsome to you, nor must you love a
little reputation, nor be pleased with a boy or a cake. For you ought to know
that the rest of men throw walls around them and houses and darkness when they
do any such things, and they have many means of concealment. A man shuts the
door, he sets somebody before the chamber: if a person comes, say that he is
out, he is not at leisure. But the Cynic instead of all these things must use
modesty as his protection: if he does not, he will he indecent in his nakedness
and under the open sky. This is his house, his door: this is the slave before
his bedchamber: this is his darkness. For he ought not to wish to hide anything
that he does: and if he does, he is gone, he has lost the character of a Cynic,
of a man who lives under the open sky, of a free man: he has begun to fear some
external thing, he has begun to have need of concealment, nor can he get
concealment when he chooses. For where shall he hide himself and how? And if by
chance this public instructor shall be detected, this pedagogue, what kind of
things will he be compelled to suffer? when then a man fears these things, is
it possible for him to be bold with his whole soul to superintend men? It
cannot be: it is impossible.
    In the first place, then, you must make your ruling faculty pure, and this
mode of life also. "Now, to me the matter to work on is my understanding, as
wood is to the carpenter, as hides to the shoemaker; and my business is the
right use of appearances. But the body is nothing to me: the parts of it are
nothing to me. Death? Let it come when it chooses, either death of the whole or
of a part. Fly, you say. And whither; can any man eject me out of the world? He
cannot. But wherever I ever I go, there is the sun, there is the moon, there
are the stars, dreams, omens, and the conversation with Gods."
    Then, if he is thus prepared, the true Cynic cannot be satisfied with this;
but he must know that he is sent a messenger from Zeus to men about good and
bad things, to show them that they have wandered and are seeking the substance
of good and evil where it is not, but where it is, they never think; and that
he is a spy, as Diogenes was carried off to Philip after the battle of
Chaeroneia as a spy. For, in fact, a Cynic is a spy of the things which are
good for men and which are evil, and it is his duty to examine carefully and to
come and report truly, and not to be struck with terror so as to point out as
enemies those who are not enemies, nor in any other way to be perturbed by
appearances nor confounded.
    It is his duty, then, to he able with a loud voice, if the occasion should
arise, and appearing on the tragic stage to say like Socrates: "Men, whither
are you hurrying, what are you doing, wretches? like blind people you are
wandering up and down: you are going by another road, and have left the true
road: you seek for prosperity and happiness where they are not, and if another
shows you where they are, you do not believe him." Why do you seek it without?
In the body? It is not there. If you doubt, look at Myro, look at Ophellius. In
possessions? It is not there. But if you do not believe me, look at Croesus:
look at those who are now rich, with what lamentations their life is filled. In
power? It is not there. If it is, those must be happy who have been twice and
thrice consuls; but they are not. Whom shall we believe in these matters? you
who from without see their affairs and are dazzled by an appearance, or the men
themselves? What do they say? Hear them when they groan, when they grieve, when
on account of these very consulships and glory and splendour they think that
they are more wretched and in greater danger. Is it in royal power? It is not:
if it were, Nero would have been happy, and Sardanapalus. But neither was
Agamemnon happy, though he was a better man than Sardanapalus and Nero; but
while others are snoring what is he doing?
       "Much from his head he tore his rooted hair."
And what does he say himself?
       "I am perplexed," he says, "and
       Disturb'd I am," and "my heart out of my bosom
       Is leaping."
    Wretch, which of your affairs goes badly? Your possessions? No. Your body?
No. But you are rich in gold and copper. What then is the matter with you? That
part of you, whatever it is, has been neglected by you and is corrupted, the
part with which we desire, with which we avoid, with which we move toward and
move from things. How neglected? He knows not the nature of good for which he
is made by nature and the nature of evil; and what is his own, and what belongs
to another; and when anything that belongs to others goes badly, he says, "Woe
to me, for the Hellenes are in dancer." Wretched is his ruling faculty, and
alone neglected and uncared for. "The Hellenes are going to die destroyed by
the Trojans." And if the Trojans do not kill them, will they not die? "Yes; but
not all at once." What difference, then, does it make? For if death is an evil,
whether men die altogether, or if they die singly, it is equally an evil. Is
anything else then going to happen than the separation of the soul and the
body? Nothing. And if the Hellenes perish, is the door closed, and is it not in
your power to die? "It is." Why then do you lament "Oh, you who are a king and
have the sceptre of Zeus?" An unhappy king does not exist more than an unhappy
god. What then art thou? In truth a shepherd: for you weep as shepherds do,
when a wolf has carried off one of their sheep: and these who are governed by
you are sheep. And why did you come hither? Was your desire in any danger? was
your aversion? was your movement? was your avoidance of things? He replies,
"No; but the wife of my brother was carried off." Was it not then a great gain
to be deprived of an adulterous wife? "Shall we be despised, then, by the
Trojans?" What kind of people are the Trojans, wise or foolish? If they are
wise, why do you fight with them? If they are fools, why do you care about
them.
    In what, then, is the good, since it is not in these things? Tell us, you
who are lord, messenger and spy. Where you do not think that it is, nor choose
to seek it: for if you chose to seek it, you would have found it to he in
yourselves; nor would you be wandering out of the way, nor seeking what belongs
to others as if it were your own. Turn your thoughts into yourselves: observe
the preconceptions which you have. What kind of a thing do you imagine the good
to be? "That which flows easily, that which is happy, that which is not
impeded." Come, and do you not naturally imagine it to be great, do you not
imagine it to be valuable? do you not imagine it to be free from harm? In what
material then ought you to seek for that which flows easily, for that which is
not impeded? in that which serves or in that which is free? "In that which is
free." Do you possess the body, then, free or is it in servile condition? "We
do not know." Do you not know that it is the slave of fever, of gout,
ophthalmia, dysentery, of a tyrant, of fire, of iron, of everything which is
stronger? Yes, it is a slave." How, then, is it possible that anything which
belongs to the body can be free from hindrance? and how is a thing great or
valuable which is naturally dead, or earth, or mud? Well then, do you possess
nothing which is free? "Perhaps nothing." And who is able to compel you to
assent to that which appears false? "No man." And who can compel you not to
assent to that which appears true? "No man." By this, then, you see that there
is something in you naturally free. But to desire or to be averse from, or to
move toward an object or to move from it, or to prepare yourself, or to propose
to do anything, which of you can do this, unless he has received an impression
of the appearance of that which is profitable or a duty? "No man." You have,
then, in these thongs also something which is not hindered and is free.
Wretched men, work out this, take care of this, seek for good here.
    "And how is it possible that a man who has nothing, who is naked,
houseless, without a hearth, squalid, without a slave, without a city, can pass
a life that flows easily?" See, God has sent you a man to show you that it is
possible. "Look at me, who am without a city, without a house, without
possessions, without a slave; I sleep on the ground; I have no wife, no
children; no praetorium, but only the earth and heavens, and one poor cloak.
And what do I want? Am I not without sorrow? am I not without fear? Am I not
free? When did any of you see me failing in the object of my desire? or ever
falling into that which I would avoid? did I ever blame God or man? did I ever
accuse any man? did any of you ever see me with sorrowful countenance? And how
do I meet with those whom you are afraid of and admire? Do not I treat them
like slaves? Who, when he sees me, does not think that he sees his king and
master?"
    This is the language of the Cynics, this their character, this is their
purpose. You say "No": but their characteristic is the little wallet, and
staff, and great jaws: the devouring of all that you give them, or storing it
up, or the abusing unseasonably all whom they meet, or displaying their
shoulder as a fine thing. Do you see how you are going, to undertake so great a
business? First take a mirror: look at your shoulders; observe your loins, your
thighs. You are going, my man, to be enrolled as a combatant in the Olympic
games, no frigid and miserable contest. In the Olympic games a man is not
permitted to be conquered only and to take his departure; but first he must be
disgraced in the sight of all the world, not in the sight of Athenians only, or
of Lacedaemonians or of Nicopolitans; next he must be whipped also if he has
entered into the contests rashly: and before being whipped, he must suffer
thirst and heat, and swallow much dust.
    Reflect more carefully, know thyself, consult the divinity, without God
attempt nothing; for if he shall advise you, be assured that he intends you to
become great or to receive many blows. For this very amusing quality is
conjoined to a Cynic: he must be flogged like an ass, and when he is flogged,
he must love those who flog him, as if he were the father of all, and the
brother of all. You say "No"; but if a man flogs you, stand in the public place
and call out, "Caesar, what do I suffer in this state of peace under thy
protection? Let us bring the offender before the proconsul." But what is Caesar
to a Cynic, or what is a proconsul, or what is any other except him who sent
the Cynic down hither, and whom he serves, namely Zeus? Does he call upon any
other than Zeus? Is he not convinced that, whatever he suffers, it is Zeus who
is exercising him? Hercules when he was exercised by Eurystheus did not think
that he was wretched, but without hesitation he attempted to execute all that
he had in hand. And is he who is trained to the contest and exercised by Zeus
going to call out and to be vexed, he who is worthy to bear the sceptre of
Diogenes? Hear what Diogenes says to the passers-by when he is in a fever,
"Miserable wretches, will you not stay? but are you going so long a journey to
Olympia to see the destruction or the fight of athletes; and will you not
choose to see the combat between a fever and a man?" Would such a man accuse
God who sent him down as if God were treating him unworthily, a man who gloried
in his circumstances, and claimed to be an example to those who were passing
by? For what shall he accuse him of? because he maintains a decency of
behavior, because he displays his virtue more conspicuously? Well, and what
does he say of poverty, about death, about pain? How did he compare his own
happiness with that of the Great King? or rather he thought that there was no
comparison between them. For where there are perturbations, and griefs, and
fears, and desires not satisfied, and aversions of things which you cannot
avoid, and envies and jealousies, how is there a road to happiness there? But
where there are corrupt principles, there these things must of necessity be.
    When the young man asked, if when a Cynic is sick, and a friend asks him to
come to his house and be taken care of in his sickness, shall the Cynic accept
the invitation, he replied: And where shall you find, I ask, a Cynic's friend?
For the man who invites ought to be such another as the that he may be worthy
of being reckoned the Cynic's friend. He ought to be a partner in the Cynic's
sceptre and his royalty, and a worthy minister, if he intends to be considered
worthy of a Cynic's friendship, as Diogenes was a friend of Antisthenes, as
Crates was a friend of Diogenes. Do you think that, if a man comes to a Cynic
and salutes him, he is the Cynic's friend, and that the Cynic will think him
worthy of receiving a Cynic into his house? So that, if you please, reflect on
this also: rather look round for some convenient dunghill on which you shall
bear your fever and which will shelter you from the north wind that you may not
be chilled. But you seem to me to wish to go into some man's house and to be
well fed there for a time. Why then do you think of attempting so great a
thing?
    "But," said the young man, "shall marriage and the procreation of children
as a chief duty be undertaken by the Cynic?" If you grant me a community of
wise men, Epictetus replies, perhaps no man will readily apply himself to the
Cynic practice. For on whose account should he undertake this manner of life?
However if we suppose that he does, nothing will prevent him from marrying and
begetting children; for his wife will be another like himself, and his
father-in-law another like himself, and his children will be brought up like
himself. But in the present state of things which is like that of an army
placed in battle order, is it not fit that the Cynic should without any
distraction be employed only on the administration of God, able to go about
among men, not tied down to the common duties of mankind, nor entangled in the
ordinary relations of life, which if he neglects, he will not maintain the
character of an honourable and good man? and if he observes them he will lose
the character of the messenger, and spy and herald of God. For consider that it
is his duty to do something toward his father-in-law, something to the other
kinsfolk of his wife, something to his wife also. He is also excluded by being
a Cynic from looking after the sickness of his own family, and from providing
for their support. And, to say nothing of the rest, he must have a vessel for
heating water for the child that he may wash it in the bath; wool for his wife
when she is delivered of a child, oil, a bed, a cup: so the furniture of the
house is increased. I say nothing of his other occupations and of his
distraction. Where, then, now is that king, he who devotes himself to the
public interests,
       The people's guardian and so full of cares.
whose duty it is to look after others, the married and those who have children;
to see who uses his wife well, who uses her badly; who quarrels; what family is
well administered, what is not; going about as a physician does and feels
pulses? He says to one, "You have a fever," to another, "You have a headache,
or the gout": he says to one, "Abstain from food"; to another he says, "Eat";
or "Do not use the bath"; to another, "You require the knife, or the cautery."
How can he have time for this who is tied to the duties of common life? is it
not his duty to supply clothing to his children, and to send them to the
schoolmaster with writing tablets, and styles. Besides, must he not supply them
with beds? for they cannot be genuine Cynics as soon as they are born. If he
does not do this, it would be better to expose the children as soon as they are
born than to kill them in this way. Consider what we are bringing the Cynic
down to, how we are taking his royalty from him. "Yes, but Crates took a wife."
You are speaking of a circumstance which arose from love and of a woman who was
another Crates. But we are inquiring about ordinary marriages and those which
are free from distractions, and making this inquiry we do not find the affair
of marriage in this state of the world a thing which is especially suited to
the Cynic.
    "How, then, shall a man maintain the existence of society?" In the name of
God, are those men greater benefactors to society who introduce into the world
to occupy their own places two or three grunting children, or those who
superintend as far as they can all mankind, and see what they do, how they
live, what they attend to, what they neglect contrary to their duty? Did they
who left little children to the Thebans do them more good than Epaminondas who
died childless? And did Priamus, who begat fifty worthless sons, or Danaus or
AEolus contribute more to the community than Homer? then shall the duty of a
general or the business of a writer exclude a man from marriage or the
begetting of children, and such a man shall not be judged to have accepted the
condition of childlessness for nothing; and shall not the royalty of a Cynic be
considered an equivalent for the want of children? Do we not perceive his
grandeur and do we not justly contemplate the character of Diogenes; and do we,
instead of this, turn our eyes to the present Cynics, who are dogs that wait at
tables and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breaking
wind, but in nothing else? For such matters would not have moved us at all nor
should we have wondered if a Cynic should not marry or beget children. Man, the
Cynic is the father of all men; the men are his sons, the women are his
daughters: he so carefully visits all, so well does he care for all. Do you
think that it is from idle impertinence that he rebukes those whom he meets? He
does it as a father, as a brother, and as the minister of the father of all,
the minister of Zeus.
    If you please, ask me also if a Cynic shall engage in the administration of
the state. Fool, do you seek a greater form of administration than that in
which he is engaged? Do you ask if he shall appear among the Athenians and say
something about the revenues and the supplies, he who must talk with all men,
alike with Athenians, alike with Corinthians, alike with Romans, not about
supplies, nor yet about revenues, nor about peace or war, but about happiness
and unhappiness, about good fortune and bad fortune, about slavery and freedom?
When a man has undertaken the administration of such a state, do you ask me if
he shall engage in the administration of a state? ask me also if he shall
govern: again I will say to you: Fool, what greater government shall he
exercise than that which he exercises now?
    It is necessary also for such a man to have a certain habit of body: for if
he appears to be consumptive, thin and pale, his testimony has not then the
same weight. For he must not only by showing the qualities of the soul prove to
the vulgar that it is in his power independent of the things which they admire
to be a good man, but he must also show by his body that his simple and frugal
way of living in the open air does not injure even the body. "See," he says, "I
am a proof of this, and my own body also is." So Diogenes used to do, for he
used to go about fresh-looking, and he attracted the notice of the many by his
personal appearance. But if a Cynic is an object of compassion, he seems to a
beggar: all persons turn away from him, all are offended with him; for neither
ought he to appear dirty so that he shall not also in this respect drive away
men; but his very roughness ought to be clean and attractive.
    There ought also to belong to the Cynic much natural grace and sharpness;
and if this is not so, he is a stupid fellow, and nothing else; and he must
have these qualities that he may be able readily and fitly to be a match for
all circumstances that may happen. So Diogenes replied to one who said, "Are
you the Diogenes who does not believe that there are gods?" "And, how," replied
Diogenes, "can this be when I think that you are odious to the gods?" On
another occasion in reply to Alexander, who stood by him when he was sleeping,
and quoted Homer's line,
       A man a councilor should not sleep all night,
he answered, when he was half-asleep,
       The people's guardian and so full of cares.
    But before all the Cynic's ruling faculty must be purer than the sun; and,
if it is not, he must be a cunning knave and a fellow of no principle, since
while he himself is entangled in some vice he will reprove others. For see how
the matter stands: to these kings and tyrants their guards and arms give the
power of reproving some persons, and of being able even to punish those who do
wrong though they are themselves bad; but to a Cynic instead of arms and guards
it is conscience which gives this power. When he knows that be has watched and
labored for mankind, and has slept pure, and sleep has left him still purer,
and that he thought whatever he has thought as a friend of the gods, as a
minister, as a participator of the power of Zeus, and that on all occasions he
is ready to say
       Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O Destiny;
and also, "If so it pleases the gods, so let it be"; why should he not have
confidence to speak freely to his own brothers, to his children, in a word to
his kinsmen? For this reason he is neither overcurious nor a busybody when he
is in this state of mind: for he is not a meddler with the affairs of others
when he is superintending human affairs, but he is looking after his own
affairs. If that is not so, you may also say that the general is a busybody,
when he inspects his soldiers, and examines them, and watches them, and
punishes the disorderly. But if, while you have a cake under your arm, you
rebuke others, I will say to you: "Will you not rather go away into a corner
and eat that which you have stolen"; what have you to do with the affairs of
others? For who are you? are you the bull of the herd, or the queen of the
bees? Show me the tokens of your supremacy, such as they have from nature. But
if you are a drone claiming the sovereignty over the bees, do you not suppose
that your fellow citizens will put you down as the bees do the drones?
    The Cynic also ought to have such power of endurance as to seem insensible
to the common sort and a stone: no man reviles him, no man strikes him, no man
insults him, but he gives his body that any man who chooses may do with it what
he likes. For he bears in mind that the inferior must be overpowered by the
superior in that in which it is inferior; and the body is inferior to the many,
the weaker to the stronger. He never then descends into such a contest in which
he can be overpowered; but he immediately withdraws from things which belong to
others, he claims not the things which are servile. where there is will and the
use of appearances, there you will see how many eyes he has so that you may
say, "Argus was blind compared with him." Is his assent ever hasty, his
movement rash, does his desire ever fall in its object, does that which he
would avoid befall him, is his purpose unaccomplished, does he ever find fault,
is he ever humiliated, is he ever envious? To these he directs all his
attention and energy; but as to everything else he snores supine. All is peace;
there is no robber who takes away his will, no tyrant. But what say you as to
his body? I say there is. And as to magistracies and honours? What does he care
for them? When then any person would frighten him through them, he says to him,
"Begone, look for children: masks are formidable to them; but I know that they
are made of shell, and they have nothing inside."
    About such a matter as this you are deliberating. Therefore, if you please,
I urge you in God's name, defer the matter, and first consider your preparation
for it. For see what Hector says to Andromache, "Retire rather," he says, "into
the house and weave:
       War is the work of men
       Of all indeed, but specially 'tis mine.
So he was conscious of his own qualification, and knew her weakness.

Chapter 23

To those who read and discuss for the sake of ostentation

    First say to yourself, who you wish to be: then do accordingly what you are
doing; for in nearly all other things we see this to be so. Those who follow
athletic exercises first determine what they wish to be, then do accordingly
what follows. If a man is a runner in the long course, there is a certain kind
of diet, of walking, rubbing and exercise: if a man is a runner in the stadium,
all these things are different; if he is a Pentathlete, they are still more
different. So you will find it also in the arts. If you are a carpenter, you
will have such and such things: if a worker in metal, such things. For
everything that we do, if we refer it to no end, we shall do it to no purpose;
and if we refer it to the wrong end, we shall miss the mark. Further, there is
a general end or purpose, and a particular purpose. First of all, we must act
as a man. What is comprehended in this? We must not be like a sheep, though
gentle, nor mischievous, like a wild beast. But the particular cud has
reference to each person's mode of life and his will. The lute-player acts as a
lute-player, the carpenter as a carpenter, the philosopher as a philosopher,
the rhetorician as a rhetorician. When then you say, "Come and hear me read to
you": take care first of all that you are not doing this without a purpose;
then, if you have discovered that you are doing this with reference to a
purpose, consider if it is the right purpose. Do you wish to do good or to be
praised? Immediately you hear him saying, "To me what is the value of praise
from the many?" and he says well, for it is of no value to a musician, so far
as he is a musician, nor to a geometrician. Do you then wish to be useful? in
what? tell us that we may run to your audience-room. Now can a man do anything
useful to others, who has not received something useful himself? No, for
neither can a man do anything useful in the carpenter's art, unless he is a
carpenter; nor in the shoemaker's art, unless he is a shoemaker.
    Do you wish to know then if you have received any advantage? Produce your
opinions, philosopher. What is the thing which desire promises? Not to fall in
the object. What does aversion promise? Not to fall into that which you would
avoid. Well; do we fulfill their promise? Tell me the truth; but if you lie, I
will tell you. Lately when your hearers came together rather coldly, and did
not give you applause, you went away humbled. Lately again when you had been
praised, you went about and said to all, "What did you think of me?"
"Wonderful, master, I swear by all that is dear to me." "But how did I treat of
that particular matter?" "Which?" "The passage in which I described Pan and the
nymphs?" "Excellently." Then do you tell me that in desire and in aversion you
are acting according to nature? Begone; try to persuade somebody else. Did you
not praise a certain person contrary to your opinion? and did you not flatter a
certain person who was the son of a senator? Would you wish your own children
to be such persons? "I hope not." Why then did you praise and flatter him? "He
is an ingenuous youth and listens well to discourses." How is this? "He admires
me." You have stated your proof. Then what do you think? do not these very
people secretly despise you? When, then, a man who is conscious that he has
neither done any good nor ever thinks of it, finds a philosopher who says, "You
have a great natural talent, and you have a candid and good disposition," what
else do you think that he says except this, "This man has some need of me?" Or
tell me what act that indicates a, great mind has he shown? Observe; he has
been in your company a long time; he has listened to your discourses, he has
heard you reading; has he become more modest? has he been turned to reflect on
himself? has he perceived in what a bad state he is? has he cast away
self-conceit? does he look for a person to teach him? "He does." A man who will
teach him to live? No, fool, but how to talk; for it is for this that he
admires you also. Listen and hear what he says: "This man writes with perfect
art, much better than Dion." This is altogether another thing. Does he say,
"This man is modest, faithful, free from perturbations?" and even if he did say
it, I should say to him, "Since this man is faithful, tell me what this
faithful man is." And if he could not tell me, I should add this, "First
understand what you say, then speak."
    You, then, who are in a wretched plight and gaping after applause and
counting your auditors, do you intend to be useful to others? "To-day many more
attended my discourse." "Yes, many; we suppose five hundred." "That is nothing;
suppose that there were a thousand." "Dion never had so many hearers." "How
could he?" "And they understand what is said beautifully." "What is fine,
master, can move even a stone." See, these are the words of a philosopher. This
is the disposition of a man who will do good to others; here is a man who has
listened to discourses, who has read what is written about Socrates as
Socratic, not as the compositions of Lysias and Isocrates. "I have often
wondered by what arguments." Not so, but "by what argument": this is more exact
than that. What, have you read the words at all in a different way from that in
which you read little odes? For if you read them as you ought, you would not
have been attending to such matters, but you would rather have been looking to
these words: "Anytus and Meletus are able to kill me, but they cannot harm me":
and "I am always of such a disposition as to pay regard to nothing of my own
except to the reason which on inquiry seems to me the best." Hence who ever
heard Socrates say, "I know something and I teach"; but he used to send
different people to different teachers. Therefore they used to come to him and
ask to be introduced to philosophy by him; and he would take them and recommend
them. Not so; but as he accompanied them he would say, "Hear me to-day
discoursing in the house of Quadratus." Why should I hear you? Do you wish to
show me that you put words together cleverly? You put them together, man; and
what good will it do you? "But only praise me." What do you mean by praising?
"Say to me, "Admirable, wonderful." Well, I say so. But if that is praise
whatever it is which philosophers mean by the name of good, what have I to
praise in you? If it is good to speak well, teach me, and will praise you.
"What then? ought a man to listen to such things without pleasure?" I hope not.
For my part I do not listen even to a lute-player without pleasure. Must I then
for this reason stand and play the lute? Hear what Socrates says, "Nor would it
be seemly for a man of my age, like a young man composing addresses, to appear
before you." "Like a young man," he says. For in truth this small art is an
elegant thing, to select words, and to put them together, and to come forward
and gracefully to read them or to speak, and while he is reading to say, "There
are not many who can do these things, I swear by all that you value."
    Does a philosopher invite people to hear him? As the sun himself draws men
to him, or as food does, does not the philosopher also draw to him those who
will receive benefit? What physician invites a man to be treated by him? Indeed
I now hear that even the physicians in Rome do invite patients, but when I
lived there, the physicians were invited. "I invite you to come and hear that
things are in a bad way for you, and that you are taking care of everything
except that of which you ought to take care, and that you are ignorant of the
good and the bad and are unfortunate and unhappy." A fine kind of invitation:
and yet if the words of the philosopher do not produce this effect on you, he
is dead, and so is the speaker. Rufus was used to say: "If you have leisure to
praise me, I am speaking to no purpose." Accordingly he used to speak in such a
way that every one of us who were sitting there supposed that some one had
accused him before Rufus: he so touched on what was doing, he so placed before
the eyes every man's faults.
    The philosopher's school, ye men, is a surgery: you ought not to go out of
it with pleasure, but with pain. For you are not in sound health when you
enter: one has dislocated his shoulder, another has an abscess, a third a
fistula, and a fourth a headache. Then do I sit and utter to you little
thoughts and exclamations that you may praise me and go away, one with his
shoulder in the same condition in which he entered, another with his head still
aching, and a third with his fistula or his abscess just as they were? Is it
for this then that young men shall quit home, and leave their parents and their
friends and kinsmen and property, that they may say to you, "Wonderful!" when
you are uttering your exclamations. Did Socrates do this, or Zeno, or
Cleanthes?
    What then? is there not the hortatory style? Who denies it? as there is the
style of refutation, and the didactic style. Who, then, ever reckoned a fourth
style with these, the style of display? What is the hortatory style? To be able
to show both to one person and to many the struggle in which they are engaged,
and that they think more about anything than about what they really wish. For
they wish the things which lead to happiness, but they look for them in the
wrong place. In order that this may be done, a thousand seats must be placed
and men must be invited to listen, and you must ascend the pulpit in a fine
robe or cloak and describe the death of Achilles. Cease, I entreat you by the
gods, to spoil good words and good acts as much as you can. Nothing can have
more power in exhortation than when the speaker shows to the hearers that he
has need of them. But tell me who when he hears you reading or discoursing is
anxious about himself or turns to reflect on himself? or when he has gone out
says, "The philosopher hit me well: I must no longer do these things." But does
he not, even if you have a great reputation, say to some person, "He spoke
finely about Xerxes"; and another says, "No, but about the battle of
Thermopylae"? Is this listening to a philosopher?

Chapter 24

That we ought not to be moved by a desire of those things which are not in our
                                     power

    Let not that which in another is contrary to nature be an evil to you: for
you are not formed by nature to be depressed with others nor to be unhappy with
others, but to be happy with them. If a man is unhappy, remember that his
unhappiness is his own fault: for God has made all men to be happy, to be free
from perturbations. For this purpose he has given means to them, some things to
each person as his own, and other things not as his own: some things subject to
hindrance and compulsion and deprivation; and these things are not a man's own:
but the things which are not subject to hindrances are his own; and the nature
of good and evil, as it was fit to be done by him who takes care of us and
protects us like a father, he has made our own. "But," you say, "I have parted
from a certain person, and he is grieved." Why did he consider as his own that
which belongs to another? why, when he looked on you and was rejoiced, did he
not also reckon that you are mortal, that it is natural for you to part from
him for a foreign country? Therefore he suffers the consequences of his own
folly. But why do you or for what purpose bewail yourself? Is it that you also
have not thought of these things? but like poor women who are good for nothing,
you have enjoyed all things in which you took pleasure, as if you would always
enjoy them, both places and men and conversation; and now you sit and weep
because you do not see the same persons and do not live in the same places.
Indeed you deserve this, to be more wretched than crows and ravens who have the
power of flying where they please and changing their nests for others, and
crossing the seas without lamenting or regretting their former condition. "Yes,
but this happens to them because they are irrational creatures." Was reason,
then, given to us by the gods for the purpose of unhappiness and misery, that
we may pass our lives in wretchedness and lamentation? Must all persons be
immortal and must no man go abroad, and must we ourselves not go abroad, but
remain rooted like plants; and, if any of our familiar friends go abroad, must
we sit and weep; and, on the contrary, when he returns, must we dance and clap
our hands like children?
    Shall we not now wean ourselves and remember what we have heard from the
philosophers? if we did not listen to them as if they were jugglers: they tell
us that this world is one city, and the substance out of which it has been
formed is one, and that there must be a certain period, and that some things
must give way to others, that some must be dissolved, and others come in their
place; some to remain in the same place, and others to be moved; and that all
things are full of friendship, first of the gods, and then of men who by nature
are made to be of one family; and some must be with one another, and others
must be separated, rejoicing in those who are with them, and not grieving for
those who are removed from them; and man in addition to being by nature of a
noble temper and having a contempt of all things which are not in the power of
his will, also possesses this property, not to be rooted nor to be naturally
fixed to the earth, but to go at different times to different places, sometimes
from the urgency of certain occasions, and at others merely for the sake of
seeing. So it was with Ulysses, who saw
       Of many men the states, and learned their ways.
And still earlier it was the fortune of Hercules to visit all the inhabited
world
       Seeing men's lawless deeds and their good rules of law:
casting out and clearing away their lawlessness and introducing in their place
good rules of law. And yet how many friends do you think that he had in Thebes,
how many in Argos, how many in Athens? and how many do you think that he gained
by going about? And he married also, when it seemed to him a proper occasion,
and begot children, and left them without lamenting or regretting or leaving
them as orphans; for he knew that no man is an orphan; but it is the father who
takes care of all men always and continuously. For it was not as mere report
that he had heard that Zeus is the father of for he thought that Zeus was his
own father, and he called him so, and to him he looked when he was doing what
he did. Therefore he was enabled to live happily in all places. And it is never
possible for happiness and desire of what is not present to come together. that
which is happy must have all that desires, must resemble a person who is filled
with food, and must have neither thirst nor hunger. "But Ulysses felt a desire
for his wife and wept as he sat on a rock." Do you attend to Homer and his
stories in everything? Or if Ulysses really wept, what was he else than an
unhappy man? and what good man is unhappy? In truth, the whole is badly
administered, if Zeus does not take care of his own citizens that they may be
happy like himself. But these things are not lawful nor right to think of: and
if Ulysses did weep and lament, he was not a good man. For who is good if he
knows not who he is? and who knows what he is, if he forgets that things which
have been made are perishable, and that it is not possible for one human being
to be with another always? To desire, then, things which are impossible is to
have a slavish character and is foolish: it is the part of a stranger, of a man
who fights against God in the only way that he can, by his opinions.
    "But my mother laments when she does not see me." Why has she not learned
these principles? and I do not say this, that we should not take care that she
may not lament, but I say that we ought not to desire in every way what is not
our own. And the sorrow of another is another's sorrow: but my sorrow is my
own. I, then, will stop my own sorrow by every means, for it is in my power:
and the sorrow of another I will endeavor to stop as far as I can; but I will
not attempt to do it by every means; for if I do, I shall be fighting against
God, I shall be opposing and shall be placing myself against him in the
administration of the universe; and the reward of this fighting against God and
of this disobedience not only will the children of my children pay, but I also
shall myself, both by day and by night, startled by dreams, perturbed,
trembling at every piece of news, and having my tranquillity depending on the
letters of others. Some person has arrived from Rome. "I only hope that there
is no harm." But what harm can happen to you, where you are not? From Hellas
some one is come: "I hope that there is no harm." In this way every place may
be the cause of misfortune to you. Is it not enough for you to be unfortunate
there where you are, and must you be so even beyond sea, and by the report of
letters? Is this the way in which your affairs are in a state of security?
"Well, then, suppose that my friends have died in the places which are far from
me." What else have they suffered than that which is the condition of mortals?
Or how are you desirous at the same time to live to old age, and at the same
time not to see the death of any person whom you love? Know you not that in the
course of a long time many and various kinds of things must happen; that a
fever shall overpower one, a robber another, and a third a tyrant? Such is the
condition of things around us, such are those who live with us in the world:
cold and heat, and unsuitable ways of living, and journeys by land, and voyages
by sea, and winds, and various circumstances which surround us, destroy one
man, and banish another, and throw one upon an embassy and another into an
army. Sit down, then, in a flutter at all these things, lamenting, unhappy,
unfortunate, dependent on another, and dependent not on one or two, but on ten
thousands upon ten thousands.
    Did you hear this when you were with the philosophers? did you learn this?
do you not know that human life is a warfare? that one man must keep watch,
another must go out as a spy, and a third must fight? and it is not possible
that all should be in one place, nor is it better that it be so. But you,
neglecting neglecting to do the commands of the general, complain when anything
more hard than usual is imposed on you, and you do not observe what you make
the army become as far as it is in your power; that if all imitate you, no man
will dig a trench, no man will put a rampart round, nor keep watch, nor expose
himself to danger, but will appear to be useless for the purposes of an army.
Again, in a vessel if you go as a sailor, keep to one place and stick to it.
And if you are ordered to climb the mast, refuse; if to run to the head of the
ship, refuse; and what master, of a ship will endure you? and will he not pitch
you overboard as a useless thing, an impediment only and bad example to the
other sailors? And so it is here also: every man's life is a kind of warfare,
and it is long and diversified. You must observe the duty of a soldier and do
everything at the nod of the general; if it is possible, divining what his
wishes are: for there is no resemblance between that general and this, neither
in strength nor in superiority of character. You are placed in a great office
of command and not in any mean place; but you are always a senator. Do you not
know that such a man must give little time to the affairs of his household, but
be often away from home, either as a governor or one who is governed, or
discharging some office, or serving in war or acting as a judge? Then do you
tell me that you wish, as a plant, to be fixed to the same places and to be
rooted? "Yes, for it is pleasant." Who says that it is not? but a soup is
pleasant, and a handsome woman is pleasant. What else do those say who make
pleasure their end? Do you not see of what men yon have uttered the language?
that it is the language of Epicureans and catamites? Next while you are doing
what they do and holding their opinions, do you speak to us the words of Zeno
and of Socrates? Will you not throw away as far as you can the things belonging
to others with which you decorate yourself, though they do not fit you at all?
For what else do they desire than to sleep without hindrance and free from
compulsion, and when they have risen to yawn at their leisure, and to wash the
face, then write and read what they choose, and then talk about some trifling
matter being praised by their friends whatever they may say, then to go forth
for a walk, and having walked about a little to bathe, and then eat and sleep,
such sleep as is the fashion of such men? why need we say how? for one can
easily conjecture. Come, do you also tell your own way of passing the time
which you desire, you who are an admirer of truth and of Socrates and Diogenes.
What do you wish to do in Athens? the same, or something else? Why then do you
call yourself a Stoic? Well, but they who falsely call themselves Roman
citizens, are severely punished; and should those, who falsely claim so great
and reverend a thing and name, get off unpunished? or is this not possible, but
the law divine and strong and inevitable is this, which exacts the severest
punishments from those who commit the greatest crimes? For what does this law
say? "Let him who pretends to things which do not belong to him be a boaster, a
vainglorious man: let him who disobeys the divine administration be base, and a
slave; let him suffer grief, let him be envious, let him pity; and in a word
let him be unhappy and lament."
    "Well then; do you wish me to pay court to a certain person? to go to his
doors?" If reason requires this to be done for the sake of country, for the
sake of kinsmen, for the sake of mankind, why should you not go? You are not
ashamed to go to the doors of a shoemaker, when you are in want of shoes, nor
to the door of a gardener, when you want lettuces; and are you ashamed to go to
the doors of the rich when you want anything? "Yes, for I have no awe of a
shoemaker." Don't feel any awe of the rich. "Nor will I flatter the gardener."
And do not flatter the rich. "How, then, shall I get what I want?" Do I say to
you, "Go as if you were certain to get what you want"? And do not I only tell
you that you may do what is becoming to yourself? "Why, then, should I still
go?" That you may have gone, that you may have discharged the duty of a
citizen, of a brother, of a friend. And further remember that you have gone to
the shoemaker, to the seller of vegetables, who have no power in anything great
or noble, though he may sell dear. You go to buy lettuces: they cost an obolus,
but not a talent. So it is here also. The matter is worth going for to the rich
man's door. Well, I will go. It is worth talking about. Let it be so; I will
talk with him. But you must also kiss his hand and flatter him with praise.
Away with that, it is a talent's worth: it is not profitable to me, nor to the
state nor to my friends, to have done that which spoils a good citizen and a
friend. "But you seem not to have been eager about the matter, if you do not
succeed." Have you again forgotten why you went? Know you not that a good man
does nothing for the sake of appearance, but for the sake of doing right? "What
advantage is it, then, to him to have done right?" And what advantage is it to
a man who writes the name of Dion to write it as he ought? The advantage is to
have written it. "Is there no reward then?" Do you seek a reward for a good man
greater than doing what is good and just? At Olympia you wish for nothing more,
but it seems to you enough to be crowned at the games. Does it seem to you so
small and worthless a thing to be good and happy? For these purposes being
introduced by the gods into this city, and it being now your duty to undertake
the work of a man, do you still want nurses also and a mamma, and do foolish
women by their weeping move you and make you effeminate? Will you thus never
cease to be a foolish child? know you not that he who does the acts of a child,
the older he is, the more ridiculous he is?
    In Athens did you see no one by going to his house? "I visited any man that
I pleased." Here also be ready to see, and you will see whom you please: only
let it be without meanness, neither with desire nor with aversion, and your
affairs will be well managed. But this result does not depend on going nor on
standing at the doors, but it depends on what is within, on your opinions. When
you have learned not to value things which are external, and not dependent on
the will, and to consider that not one of them is your own, but that these
things only are your own, to exercise the judgment well, to form opinions, to
move toward an object, to desire, to turn from a thing, where is there any
longer room for flattery, where for meanness? why do you still long for the
quiet there, and for the places to which you are accustomed? Wait a little and
you will again find these places familiar: then, if you are of so ignoble a
nature, again if you leave these also, weep and lament.
    "How then shall I become of an affectionate temper?" By being of a noble
disposition, and happy. For it is not reasonable to be means-spirited nor to
lament yourself, nor to depend on another, nor even to blame God or man. I
entreat you, become an affectionate person in this way, by observing these
rules. But if through this affection, as you name it, you are going to be a
slave and wretched, there is no profit in being affectionate. And what prevents
you from loving another as a person subject to mortality, as one who may go
away from you. Did not Socrates love his own children? He did; but it was as a
free man, as one who remembered that he must first be a friend to the gods. For
this reason he violated nothing which was becoming to a good man, neither in
making his defense nor by fixing a penalty on himself, nor even in the former
part of his life when he was a senator or when be was a soldier. But we are
fully supplied with every pretext for being of ignoble temper, some for the
sake of a child, some for a mother, and others for brethren's sake. But it is
not fit for us to be unhappy on account of any person, but to be happy on
account of all, but chiefly on account of God who has made us for this end.
Well, did Diogenes love nobody, who was so kind and so much a lover of all that
for mankind in general he willingly undertook so much labour and bodily
sufferings? He did love mankind, but how? As became a minister of God, at the
same time caring for men, and being also subject to God. For this reason all
the earth was his country, and no particular place; and when he was taken
prisoner he did not regret Athens nor his associates and friends there, but
even he became familiar with the pirates and tried to improve them; and being
sold afterward he lived in Corinth as before at Athens; and he would have
behaved the same, if he had gone to the country of the Perrhaebi. Thus is
freedom acquired. For this reason he used to say, "Ever since Antisthenes made
me free, I have not been a slave." How did Antisthenes make him free? Hear what
he says: "Antisthenes taught me what is my own, and what is not my own;
possessions are not my own, nor kinsmen, domestics, friends, nor reputation,
nor places familiar, nor mode of life; all these belong to others." What then
is your own? "The use of appearances. This be showed to me, that I possess it
free from hindrance, and from compulsion, no person can put an obstacle in my
way, no person can force me to use appearances otherwise than I wish." Who then
has any power over me? Philip or Alexander, or Perdiccas or the Great King? How
have they this power? For if a man is going to be overpowered by a man, he must
long before be overpowered by things. If, then, pleasure is not able to subdue
a man, nor pain, nor fame, nor wealth, but he is able, when he chooses, to spit
out all his poor body in a man's face and depart from life, whose slave can he
still be? But if he dwelt with pleasure in Athens, and was overpowered by this
manner of life, his affairs would have been at every man's command; the
stronger would have had the power of grieving him. How do you think that
Diogenes would have flattered the pirates that they might sell him to some
Athenian, that some time he might see that beautiful Piraeus, and the Long
Walls and the Acropolis? In what condition would you see them? As a captive, a
slave and mean: and what would be the use of it for you? "Not so: but I should
see them as a free man." Show me, how you would be free. Observe, some person
has caught you, who leads you away from your accustomed place of abode and
says, "You are my slave, for it is in my power to hinder you from living as you
please, it is in my power to treat you gently, and to humble you: when I
choose, on the contrary you are cheerful and go elated to Athens." What do you
say to him who treats you as a slave? What means have you of finding one who
will rescue you from slavery? Or cannot you even look him in the face, but
without saying more do you entreat to be set free? Man, you ought to go gladly
to prison, hastening, going before those who lead you there. Then, I ask you,
are you unwilling to live in Rome and desire to live in Hellas? And when you
must die, will you then also fill us with your lamentations, because you will
not see Athens nor walk about in the Lyceion? Have you gone abroad for this?
was it for this reason you have sought to find some person from whom you might
receive benefit? What benefit? That you may solve syllogisms more readily, or
handle hypothetical arguments? and for this reason did you leave brother,
country, friends, your family, that you might return when you had learned these
things? So you did not go abroad to obtain constancy of mind, nor freedom from
perturbation, nor in order that, being secure from harm, you may never complain
of any person, accuse no person, and no man may wrong you, and thus you may
maintain your relative position without impediment? This is a fine traffic that
you have gone abroad for in syllogisms and sophistical arguments and
hypothetical: if you like, take your place in the agora and proclaim them for
sale like dealers in physic. Will you not deny even all that you have learned
that you may not bring a bad name on your theorems as useless? What harm has
philosophy done you? Wherein has Chrysippus injured you that you should prove
by your acts that his labours are useless? Were the evils that you had there
not enough, those which were the cause of your pain and lamentation, even if
you had not gone abroad? Have you added more to the list? And if you again have
other acquaintances and friends, you will have more causes for lamentation; and
the same also if you take an affection for another country. Why, then, do you
live to surround yourself with other sorrows upon sorrows through which you are
unhappy? Then, I ask you, do you call this affection? What affection, man! If
it is a good thing, it is the cause of no evil: if it is bad, I have nothing to
do with it. I am formed by nature for my own good: I am not formed for my own
evil.
    What then is the discipline for this purpose? First of all the highest and
the principal, and that which stands as it were at the entrance, is this; when
you are delighted with anything, be delighted as with a thing which is not one
of those which cannot be taken away, but as with something of such a kind, as
an earthen pot is, or a glass cup, that, when it has been broken, you may
remember what it was and may not be troubled. So in this matter also: if you
kiss your own child, or your brother or friend, never give full license to the
appearance, and allow not your pleasure to go as far as it chooses; but check
it, and curb it as those who stand behind men in their triumphs and remind them
that they are mortal. Do you also remind yourself in like manner, that he whom
you love is mortal, and that what you love is nothing of your own: it has been
given to you for the present, not that it should not be taken from you, nor has
it been given to you for all time, but as a fig is given to you or a bunch of
grapes at the appointed season of the year. But if you wish for these things in
winter, you are a fool. So if you wish for your son or friend when it is not
allowed to you, you must know that you are wishing for a fig in winter. For
such as winter is to a fig, such is every event which happens from the universe
to the things which are taken away according to its nature. And further, at the
times when you are delighted with a thing, place before yourself the contrary
appearances. What harm is it while you are kissing your child to say with a
lisping voice, "To-morrow you will die"; and to a friend also, "To-morrow you
will go away or I shall, and never shall we see one another again"? "But these
are words of bad omen." And some incantations also are of bad omen; but because
they are useful, I don't care for this; only let them be useful. "But do you
call things to be of bad omen except those which are significant of some evil?"
Cowardice is a word of bad omen, and meanness of spirit, and sorrow, and grief
and shamelessness. These words are of bad omen: and yet we ought not to
hesitate to utter them in order to protect ourselves against the things. Do you
tell me that a name which is significant of any natural thing is of evil omen?
say that even for the ears of corn to be reaped is of bad omen, for it
signifies the destruction of the ears, but not of the world. Say that the
falling of the leaves also is of bad omen, and for the dried fig to take the
place of the green fig, and for raisins to be made from the grapes. For all
these things are changes from a former state into other states; not a
destruction, but a certain fixed economy and administration. Such is going away
from home and a small change: such is death, a greater change, not from the
state which now is to that which is not, but to that which is not now. "Shall I
then no longer exist?" You will not exist, but you be something else, of which
the world now has need: for you also came into existence not when you chose,
but when the world had need of you.
    Wherefore the wise and good man, remembering who he is and whence he came,
and by whom he was produced, is attentive only to this, how he may fill his
place with due regularity and obediently to God. "Dost Thou still wish me to
exist? I will continue to exist as free, as noble in nature, as Thou hast
wished me to exist: for Thou hast made me free from hindrance in that which is
my own. But hast Thou no further need of me? I thank Thee; and so far I have
remained for Thy sake, and for the sake of no other person, and now in
obedience to Thee I depart." "How dost thou depart?" Again, I say, as Thou hast
pleased, as free, as Thy servant, as one who has known Thy commands and Thy
prohibitions. And so long as I shall stay in Thy service, whom dost Thou will
me to be? A prince or a private man, a senator or a common person, a soldier or
a general, a teacher or a master of a family? whatever place and position Thou
mayest assign to me, as Socrates says, "I will die ten thousand times rather
than desert them." And where dost Thou will me to be? in Rome or Athens, or
Thebes or Gyara. Only remember me there where I am. If Thou sendest me to a
place where there are no means for men living according to nature, I shall not
depart in disobedience to Thee, but as if Thou wast giving me the signal to
retreat: I do not leave Thee, let this be to from my intention, but perceive
that Thou hast no need of me. If means of living according to nature be allowed
me, I will seek no other place than that in which I am, or other men than those
among whom I am.
    Let these thoughts be ready to hand by night and by day: these you should
write, these you should read: about these you should talk to yourself, and to
others. Ask a man, "Can you help me at all for this purpose?" and further, go
to another and to another. Then if anything that is said he contrary to your
wish, this reflection first will immediately relieve you, that it is not
unexpected. For it is a great thing in all cases to say, "I knew that I begot a
son who is mortal." For so you also will say, "I knew that I am mortal, I knew
that I may leave my home, I knew that I may be ejected from it, I knew that I
may be led to prison." Then if you turn round, and look to yourself, and seek
the place from which comes that which has happened, you will forthwith
recollect that it comes from the place of things which are out of the power of
the will, and of things which are not my own. "What then is it to me?" Then,
you will ask, and this is the chief thing: "And who is it that sent it?" The
leader, or the general, the state, the law of the state. Give it me then, for I
must always obey the law in everything. Then, when the appearance pains you,
for it is not in your power to prevent this, contend against it by the aid of
reason, conquer it: do not allow it to gain strength nor to lead you to the
consequences by raising images such as it pleases and as it pleases. If you be
in Gyara, do not imagine the mode of living at Rome, and how many pleasures
there were for him who lived there and how many there would be for him who
returned to Rome: but fix your mind on this matter, how a man who lives in
Gyara ought to live in Gyara like a man of courage. And if you be in Rome, do
not imagine what the life in Athens is, but think only of the life in Rome.
    Then in the place of all other delights substitute this, that of being
conscious that you are obeying God, that, not in word but in deed, you are
performing the acts of a wise and good man. For what a thing it is for a man to
be able to say to himself, "Now, whatever the rest may say in solemn manner in
the schools and may be judged to be saying in a way contrary to common opinion,
this I am doing; and they are sitting and are discoursing of my virtues and
inquiring about me and praising me; and of this Zeus has willed that I shall
receive from myself a demonstration, and shall myself know if He has a soldier
such as He ought to have, a citizen such as He ought to have, and if He has
chosen to produce me to the rest of mankind as a witness of the things which
are independent of the will: 'See that you fear without reason, that you
foolishly desire what you do desire: seek not the good in things external; seek
it in yourselves: if you do not, you will not find it.' For this purpose He
leads me at one time hither, at another time sends me thither, shows me to men
as poor, without authority, and sick; sends me to Gyara, leads me into prison,
not because He hates me, far from him be such a meaning, for who hates the best
of his servants? nor yet because He cares not for me, for He does not neglect
any even of the smallest things;' but He does this for the purpose of
exercising me and making use of me as a witness to others. Being appointed to
such a service, do I still care about the place in which I am, or with whom I
am, or what men say about me? and do I not entirely direct my thoughts to God
and to His instructions and commands?"
    Having these things always in hand, and exercising them by yourself, and
keeping them in readiness, you will never be in want of one to comfort you and
strengthen you. For it is not shameful to be without something to eat, but not
to have reason sufficient for keeping away fear and sorrow. But if once you
have gained exemption from sorrow and fear, will there any longer be a tyrant
for you, or a tyrant's guard, or attendants on Caesar? Or shall any appointment
to offices at court cause you pain, or shall those who sacrifice in the
Capitol, on the occasion of being named to certain functions, cause pain to you
who have received so great authority from Zeus? Only do not make a proud
display of it, nor boast of it; but show it by your acts; and if no man
perceives it, be satisfied that you are yourself in a healthy state and happy.

Chapter 25

To those who fall off from their purpose

    Consider as to the things which you proposed to yourself at first, which
you have secured and which you have not; and how you are pleased when you
recall to memory the one and are pained about the other; and if it is possible,
recover the things wherein you failed. For we must not shrink when we are
engaged in the greatest combat, but we must even take blows. For the combat
before us is not in wrestling and the Pancration, in which both the successful
and the unsuccessful may have the greatest merit, or may have little, and in
truth may be very fortunate or very unfortunate; but the combat is for good
fortune and happiness themselves. Well then, even if we have renounced the
contest in this matter, no man hinders us from renewing the combat again, and
we are not compelled to wait for another four years that the games at Olympia
may come again; but as soon as you have recovered and restored yourself, and
employ the same zeal, you may renew the combat again; and if again you renounce
it, you may again renew it; and if you once gain the victory, you are like him
who has never renounced the combat. Only do not, through a habit of doing the
same thing, begin to do it with pleasure, and then like a bad athlete go about
after being conquered in all the circuit of the games like quails who have run
away.
    "The sight of a beautiful young girl overpowers me. Well, have I not been
overpowered before? An inclination arises in me to find fault with a person;
for have I not found fault with him before?" You speak to us as if you had come
off free from harm, just as if a man should say to his physician who forbids
him to bathe, "Have I not bathed before?" If, then, the physician can say to
him, "Well, and what, then, happened to you after the bath? Had you not a
fever, had you not a headache?" And when you found fault with a person lately,
did you not do the act of a malignant person, of a trifling babbler; did you
not cherish this habit in you by adding to it the corresponding acts? And when
you were overpowered by the young girl, did you come off unharmed? Why, then,
do you talk of what you did before? You ought, I think, remembering what you
did, as slaves remember the blows which they have received, to abstain from the
same faults. But the one case is not like the other; for in the case of slaves
the pain causes the remembrance: but in the case of your faults, what is the
pain, what is the punishment; for when have you been accustomed to fly from
evil acts? Sufferings, then, of the trying character are useful to us, whether
we choose or not.

Chapter 26

To those who fear want

    Are you not ashamed at more cowardly and more mean than fugitive slaves?
How do they when they run away leave their masters? on what estates do they
depend, and what domestics do they rely on? Do they not, after stealing a
little which is enough for the first days, then afterward move on through land
or through sea, contriving one method after another for maintaining their
lives? And what fugitive slave ever died of hunger? But you are afraid lest
necessary things should fall you, and are sleepless by night. Wretch, are you
so blind, and don't you see the road to which the want of necessaries leads?
"Well, where does it lead?" To the same place to which a fever leads, or a
stone that falls on you, to death. Have you not often said this yourself to
your companions? have you not read much of this kind, and written much? and how
often have you boasted that you were easy as to death?
    "Yes: but my wife and children also suffer hunger." Well then, does their
hunger lead to any other place? Is there not the same descent to some place for
them also? Is not there the same state below for them? Do you not choose, then,
to look to that place full of boldness against every want and deficiency, to
that place to which both the richest and those who have held the highest
offices, and kings themselves and tyrants must descend? or to which you will
descend hungry, if it should so happen, but they burst by indigestion and
drunkenness. What beggar did you hardly ever see who was not an old man, and
even of extreme old age? But chilled with cold day and night, and lying on the
ground, and eating only what is absolutely necessary they approach near to the
impossibility of dying. Cannot you write? Cannot you teach children? Cannot you
be a watchman at another person's door? "But it is shameful to come to such
necessity." Learn, then, first what are the things which are shameful, and then
tell us that you are a philosopher: but at present do not, even if any other
man call you so, allow it.
    Is that shameful to you which is not your own act, that of which you are
not the cause, that which has come to you by accident, as a headache, as a
fever? If your parents were poor, and left their property to others, and if
while they live, they do not help you at all, is this shameful to you? Is this
what you learned with the philosophers? Did you never hear that the thing which
is shameful ought to be blamed, and that which is blamable is worthy of blame?
Whom do you blame for an act which is not his own, which he did not do himself?
Did you, then, make your father such as he is, or is it in your power to
improve him? Is this power given to you? Well then, ought you to wish the
things which are not given to you, or to be ashamed if you do not obtain them?
And have you also been accustomed while you were studying philosophy to look to
others and to hope for nothing from yourself? Lament then and groan and eat
with fear that you may not have food to-morrow. Tremble about your poor slaves
lest they steal, lest they run away, lest they die. So live, and continue to
live, you who in name only have approached philosophy and have disgraced its
theorems as far as you can by showing them to be useless and unprofitable to
those who take them up; you who have never sought constancy, freedom from
perturbation, and from passions: you who have not sought any person for the
sake of this object, but many for the sake of syllogisms; you who have never
thoroughly examined any of these appearances by yourself, "Am I able to bear,
or am I not able to bear? What remains for me to do?" But as if all your
affairs were well and secure, you have been resting on the third topic, that of
things being unchanged, in order that you may possess unchanged- what?
cowardice, mean spirit, the admiration of the rich, desire without attaining
any end, and avoidance which fails in the attempt? About security in these
things you have been anxious.
    Ought you not to have gained something in addition from reason and, then,
to have protected this with security? And whom did you ever see building a
battlement all round and not encircling it with a wall? And what doorkeeper is
placed with no door to watch? But you practice in order to be able to prove-
what? You practice that you may not be tossed as on the sea through sophisms,
and tossed about from what? Show me first what you hold, what you measure, or
what you weigh; and show me the scales or the medimnus; or how long will you go
on measuring the dust? Ought you not to demonstrate those things which make men
happy, which make things go on for them in the way as they wish, and why we
ought to blame no man, accuse no man, and acquiesce in the administration of
the universe? Show me these. "See, I show them: I will resolve syllogisms for
you." This is the measure, slave; but it is not the thing measured. Therefore
you are now paying the penalty for what you neglected, philosophy: you tremble,
you lie awake, you advise with all persons; and if your deliberations are not
likely to please all, you think that you have deliberated ill. Then you fear
hunger, as you suppose: but it is not hunger that you fear, but you are afraid
that you will not have a cook, that you will not have another to purchase
provisions for the table, a third to take off your shoes, a fourth to dress
you, others to rub you, and to follow you, in order that in the bath, when you
have taken off your clothes and stretched yourself out like those who are
crucified you may be rubied on this side and on that, and then the aliptes may
say, "Change his position, present the side, take hold of his head, show the
shoulder"; and then when you have left the bath and gone home, you may call
out, "Does no one bring something to eat?" And then, "Take away the tables,
sponge them": you are afraid of this, that you may not be able to lead the life
of a sick man. But learn the life of those who are in health, how slaves live,
how labourers, how those live who are genuine philosophers; how Socrates lived,
who had a wife and children; how Diogenes lived, and how Cleanthes, who
attended to the school and drew water. If you choose to have these things, you
will have them everywhere, and you will live in full confidence. Confiding in
what? In that alone in which a man can confide, in that which is secure, in
that which is not subject to hindrance, in that which cannot be taken away,
that is, in your own will. And why have you made yourself so useless and good
for nothing that no man will choose to receive you into his house, no man to
take care of you? but if a utensil entire and useful were cast abroad, every
man who found it would take it up and think it a gain; but no man will take you
up, and every man will consider you a loss. So cannot you discharge the office
of a dog, or of a cock? Why then do you choose to live any longer, when you are
what you are?
    Does any good man fear that he shall fall to have food? To the blind it
does not fall, to the lame it does not: shall it fall to a good man? And to a
good soldier there does not fail to one who gives him pay, nor to a labourer,
nor to a shoemaker: and to the good man shall there be wanting such a person?
Does God thus neglect the things that He has established, His ministers, His
witnesses, whom alone He employs as examples to the uninstructed, both that He
exists, and administers well the whole, and does not neglect human affairs, and
that to a good man there is no evil either when he is living or when he is
dead? What, then, when He does not supply him with food? What else does He do
than like a good general He has given me the signal to retreat? I obey, I
follow, assenting to the words of the Commander, praising, His acts: for I came
when it pleased Him, and I will also go away when it pleases Him; and while I
lived, it was my duty to praise God both by myself, and to each person
severally and to many. He does not supply me with many things, nor with
abundance, He does not will me to live luxuriously; for neither did He supply
Hercules who was his own son; but another was king of Argos and Mycenae, and
Hercules obeyed orders, and laboured, and was exercised. And Eurystheus was
what he was, neither kin, of Argos nor of Mycenae, for he was not even king of
himself; but Hercules was ruler and leader of the whole earth and sea, who
purged away lawlessness, and introduced justice and holiness; and he did these
things both naked and alone. And when Ulysses was cast out shipwrecked, did
want humiliate him, did it break his spirit? but how did he go off to the
virgins to ask for necessaries, to beg which is considered most shameful?
       As a lion bred in the mountains trusting in his strength.
    Relying on what? Not on reputation nor on wealth nor on the power of a
magistrate, but on his own strength, that is, on his opinions about the things
which are in our power and those which, are not. For these are the only things
which make men free, which make them escape from hindrance, which raise the
head of those who are depressed, which make them look with steady eyes on the
rich and on tyrants. And this was the gift given to the philosopher. But you
will not come forth bold, but trembling about your trifling garments and silver
vessels. Unhappy man, have you thus wasted your time till now?
    "What, then, if I shall be sick?" You will be sick in such a way as you
ought to be. "Who will take care of me?" God; your friends. "I shall lie down
on a hard bed." But you will lie down like a man. "I shall not have a
convenient chamber." You will be sick in an inconvenient chamber. "Who will
provide for me the necessary food?" Those who provide for others also. You will
be sick like Manes. "And what, also, will be the end of the sickness? Any other
than death?" Do you then consider that this the chief of all evils to man and
the chief mark of mean spirit and of cowardice is not death, but rather the
fear of death? Against this fear then I advise you to exercise yourself: to
this let all your reasoning tend, your exercises, and reading; and you will
know that thus only are men made free.

BOOK FOUR

Chapter 1

About freedom

    He is free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither subject to
compulsion nor to hindrance, nor to force; whose movements to action are not
impeded, whose desires attain their purpose, and who does not fall into that
which he would avoid. Who, then, chooses to live in error? No man. Who chooses
to live deceived, liable to mistake, unjust, unrestrained, discontented, mean?
No man. Not one then of the bad lives as he wishes; nor is he, then, free. And
who chooses to live in sorrow, fear, envy, pity, desiring and failing in his
desires, attempting to avoid something and falling into it? Not one. Do we then
find any of the bad free from sorrow, free from fear, who does not fall into
that which he would avoid, and does not obtain that which he wishes? Not one;
nor then do we find any bad man free.
    If, then, a man who has been twice consul should hear this, if you add,
"But you are a wise man; this is nothing to you": he will pardon you. But if
you tell him the truth, and say, "You differ not at all from those who have
been thrice sold as to being yourself not a slave," what else ought you to
expect than blows? For he says, "What, I a slave, I whose father was free,
whose mother was free, I whom no man can purchase: I am also of senatorial
rank, and a friend of Caesar, and I have been a consul, and I own many slaves."
In the first place, most excellent senatorial man, perhaps your father also was
a slave in the same kind of servitude, and your mother, and your grandfather
and all your ancestors in an ascending series. But even if they were as free as
it is possible, what is this to you? What if they were of a noble nature, and
you of a mean nature; if they were fearless, and you a coward; if they had the
power of self-restraint, and you are not able to exercise it.
    "And what," you may say, "has this to do with being a slave?" Does it seem
to you to be nothing to do a thing unwillingly, with compulsion, with groans,
has this nothing to do with being a slave? "It is something," you say: "but who
is able to compel me, except the lord of all, Caesar?" Then even you yourself
have admitted that you have one master. But that he is the common master of
all, as you say, let not this console you at all: but know that you are a slave
in a great family. So also the people of Nicopolis are used to exclaim, "By the
fortune of Caesar, are free."
    However, if you please, let us not speak of Caesar at present. But tell me
this: did you never love any person, a young girl, or slave, or free? What then
is this with respect to being a slave or free? Were you never commanded by the
person beloved to do something which you did not wish to do? have you never
flattered your little slave? have you never kissed her feet? And yet if any man
compelled you to kiss Caesar's feet, you would think it an insult and excessive
tyranny. What else, then, is slavery? Did you never go out by night to some
place whither you did not wish to go, did you not expend what you did not wish
to expend, did you not utter words with sighs and groans, did you not submit to
abuse and to be excluded? But if you are ashamed to confess your own acts, see
what Thrasonides says and does, who having seen so much military service as
perhaps not even you have, first of all went out by night, when Geta does not
venture out, but if he were compelled by his master, would have cried out much
and would have gone out lamenting his bitter slavery. Next, what does
Thrasonides say? "A worthless girl has enslaved me, me whom no enemy, ever
did." Unhappy man, who are the slave even of a girl, and a worthless girl. Why
then do you still call yourself free? and why do you talk of your service in
the army? Then he calls for a sword and is angry with him who out of kindness
refuses it; and he sends presents to her who hates him, and entreats and weeps,
and on the other hand, having had a little success, he is elated. But even then
how? was he free enough neither to desire nor to fear?
    Now consider in the case of animals, how we employ the notion of liberty.
Men keep tame lions shut up, and feed them, and some take them about; and who
will say that this lion is free? Is it not the fact that the more he lives at
his ease, so much the more he is in a slavish condition? and who if he had
perception and reason would wish to be one of these lions? Well, these birds
when they are caught and are kept shut up, how much do they suffer in their
attempts to escape? and some of them die of hunger rather than submit to such a
kind of life. And as many of them as live, hardly live and with suffering pine
away; and if they ever find any opening, they make their escape. So much do
they desire their natural liberty, and to be independent and free from
hindrance. And what harm is there to you in this? "What do you say? I am formed
by nature to fly where I choose, to live in the open air, to sing when I
choose: you deprive me of all this, and say, 'What harm is it to you?' For this
reason we shall say that those animals only are free which cannot endure
capture, but, as soon as they are caught, escape from captivity by death. So
Diogenes says that there is one way to freedom, and that is to die content: and
he writes to the Persian king, "You cannot enslave the Athenian state any more
than you can enslave fishes." "How is that? cannot I catch them?" "If you catch
them," says Diogenes, "they will immediately leave you, as fishes do; for if
you catch a fish, it dies; and if these men that are caught shall die, of what
use to you is the preparation for war?" These are the words of a free man who
had carefully examined the thing and, as was natural, had discovered it. But if
you look for it in a different place from where it is, what wonder if you never
find it?
    The slave wishes to be set free immediately. Why? Do you think that he
wishes to pay money to the collectors of twentieths? No; but because he
imagines that hitherto through not having obtained this, he is hindered and
unfortunate. "If I shall be set free, immediately it is all happiness, I care
for no man, I speak to all as an equal and, like to them, I go where I choose,
I come from any place I choose, and go where I choose." Then he is set free;
and forthwith having no place where he can eat, he looks for some man to
flatter, some one with whom he shall sup: then he either works with his body
and endures the most dreadful things; and if he can obtain a manger, he falls
into a slavery much worse than his former slavery; or even if he is become
rich, being a man without any knowledge of what is good, he loves some little
girl, and in his happiness laments and desires to be a slave again. He says,
"what evil did I suffer in my state of slavery? Another clothed me, another
supplied me with shoes, another fed me, another looked after me in sickness;
and I did only a few services for him. But now a wretched man, what things I
suffer, being a slave of many instead of to one. But however," he says, "if I
shall acquire rings, then I shall live most prosperously and happily." First,
in order to acquire these rings, he submits to that which he is worthy of;
then, when he has acquired them, it is again all the same. Then he says, "if I
shall be engaged in military service, I am free from all evils." He obtains
military service. He suffers as much as a flogged slave, and nevertheless he
asks for a second service and a third. After this, when he has put the
finishing stroke to his career and is become a senator, then he becomes a slave
by entering into the assembly, then he serves the finer and most splendid
slavery- not to be a fool, but to learn what Socrates taught, what is the
nature of each thing that exists, and that a man should not rashly adapt
preconceptions to the several things which are. For this is the cause to men of
all their evils, the not being able to adapt the general preconceptions to the
several things. But we have different opinions. One man thinks that he is sick:
not so however, but the fact is that he does not adapt his preconceptions
right. Another thinks that he is poor; another that he has a severe father or
mother; and another, again, that Caesar is not favourable to him. But all this
is one and only one thing, the not knowing how to adapt the preconceptions. For
who has not a preconception of that which is bad, that it is hurtful, that it
ought to be avoided, that it ought in every way to be guarded against? One
preconception is not repugnant to another, only where it comes to the matter of
adaptation. What then is this evil, which is both hurtful, and a thing to be
avoided? He answers, "Not to be Caesar's friend." He is gone far from the mark,
he has missed the adaptation, he is embarrassed, he seeks the things which are
not at all pertinent to the matter; for when he has succeeded in being Caesar's
friend, nevertheless he has failed in finding what he sought. For what is that
which every man seeks? To live secure, to be happy, to do everything as he
wishes, not to be hindered, nor compelled. When then he is become the friend of
Caesar, is he free from hindrance? free from compulsion, is he tranquil, is he
happy? Of whom shall we inquire? What more trustworthy witness have we than
this very man who is, become Caesar's friend? Come forward and tell us when did
you sleep more quietly, now or before you became Caesar's friend? Immediately
you hear the answer, "Stop, I entreat you, and do not mock me: you know not
what miseries I suffer, and sleep does not come to me; but one comes and says,
'Caesar is already awake, he is now going forth': then come troubles and
cares." Well, when did you sup with more pleasure, now or before? Hear what he
says about this also. He says that if he is not invited, he is pained: and if
he is invited, he sups like a slave with his master, all the while being
anxious that he does not say or do anything foolish. And what do you suppose
that he is afraid of; lest he should be lashed like a slave? How can he expect
anything so good? No, but as befits so great a man, Caesar's friend, he is
afraid that he may lose his head. And when did you bathe more free from
trouble, and take your gymnastic exercise more quietly? In fine, which kind of
life did you prefer? your present or your former life? I can swear that no man
is so stupid or so ignorant of truth as not to bewail his own misfortunes the
nearer he is in friendship to Caesar.
    Since, then, neither those who are called kings live as they choose, nor
the friends of kings, who finally are those who are free? Seek, and you will
find; for you have aids from nature for the discovery of truth. But if you are
not able yourself by going along these ways only to discover that which
follows, listen to those who have made the inquiry. What do they say? Does
freedom seem to you a good thing? "The greatest good." Is it possible, then,
that he who obtains the greatest good can be unhappy or fare badly? "No."
Whomsoever, then, you shall see unhappy, unfortunate, lamenting, confidently
declare that they are not free. "I do declare it." We have now, then, got away
from buying and selling and from such arrangements about matters of property;
for if you have rightly assented to these matters, if the Great King is
unhappy, he cannot be free, nor can a little king, nor a man of consular rank,
nor one who has been twice consul. "Be it so."
    Further, then, answer me this question also: Does freedom seem to you to be
something great and noble and valuable? "How should it not seem so?" Is it
possible, then, when a man obtains anything, so great and valuable and noble to
be mean? "It is not possible." When, then, you see any man subject to another,
or flattering him contrary to his own opinion, confidently affirm that this man
also is not free; and not only if he do this for a bit of supper, but also if
he does it for a government or a consulship: and call these men "little slaves"
who for the sake of little matters do these things, and those who do so for the
sake of great things call "great slaves," as they deserve to be. "This is
admitted also." Do you think that freedom is a thing independent and
self-governing? "Certainly." Whomsoever, then, it is in the power of another to
hinder and compel, declare that he is not free. And do not look, I entreat you,
after his grandfathers and great-grandfathers, or inquire about his being
bought or sold; but if you hear him saying from his heart and with feeling,
"Master," even if the twelve fasces precede him, call him a slave. And if you
hear him say, "Wretch that I am, how much I suffer," call him a slave. If,
finally, you see him lamenting, complaining, unhappy, call him a slave though
he wears a praetexta. If, then, he is doing nothing of this kind, do not yet
say that he is free, but learn his opinions, whether they are subject to
compulsion, or may produce hindrance, or to bad fortune; and if you find him
such, call him a slave who has a holiday in the Saturnalia: say that his master
is from home: he will return soon, and you will know what he suffers. "Who will
return?" Whoever has in himself the power over anything which is desired by the
man, either to give it to him or to take it away? "Thus, then, have we many
masters?" We have: for we have circumstances as masters prior to our present
masters; and these circumstances are many. Therefore it must of necessity be
that those who have the power over any of these circumstances must be our
masters. For no man fears Caesar himself, but he fears death, banishment,
deprivation of his property, prison, and disgrace. Nor does any man love
Caesar, unless Caesar is a person of great merit, but he loves wealth, the
office of tribune, praetor or consul. When we love, and hate, and fear these
things, it must be that those who have the power over them must be our masters.
Therefore we adore them even as gods; for we think that what possesses the
power of conferring the greatest advantage on us is divine. Then we wrongly
assume that a certain person has the power of conferring the greatest
advantages; therefore he is something divine. For if we wrongly assume that a
certain person has the power of conferring the greatest advantages, it is a
necessary consequence that the conclusion from these premises must be false.
    What, then, is that which makes a man free from hindrance and makes him his
own master? For wealth does not do it, nor consulship, nor provincial
government, nor royal power; but something else must be discovered. What then
is that which, when we write, makes us free from hindrance and unimpeded? "The
knowledge of the art of writing." What, then, is it in playing the lute? "The
science of playing the lute." Therefore in life also it is the science of life.
You have, then, heard in a general way: but examine the thing also in the
several parts. Is it possible that he who desires any of the things which
depend on others can be free from hindrance? "No." Is it possible for him to be
unimpeded? "No." Therefore he cannot be free. Consider then: whether we have
nothing which is in our own power only, or whether we have all things, or
whether some things are in our own power, and others in the power of others.
"What do you mean?" When you wish the body to be entire, is it in your power or
not? "It is not in my power." When you wish it to be healthy? "Neither is this
in my power." When you wish it to be handsome? "Nor is this." Life or death?
"Neither is this in my power." Your body, then, is another's, subject to every
man who is stronger than yourself? "It is." But your estate, is it in your
power to have it when you please, and as long as you please, and such as you
please? "No." And your slaves? "No." And your clothes? "No." And your house?
"No." And your horses? "Not one of these things." And if you wish by all means
your children to live, or your wife, or your brother, or your friends, is it in
your power? "This also is not in my power."
    Whether, then, have you nothing which is in your own power, which depends
on yourself only and cannot be taken from you, or have you anything of the
kind? "I know not." Look at the thing, then, thus, examine it. Is any man able
to make you assent to that which is false? "No man." In the matter of assent,
then, you are free from hindrance and obstruction. "Granted." Well; and can a
man force you to desire to move toward that to which you do not choose? "He
can, for when he threatens me with death or bonds, he compels me to desire to
move toward it." If, then, you despise death and bonds, do you still pay any
regard to him? "No." Is, then, the despising of death an act of your own, or is
it not yours? "It is my act." It is your own act, then, also to desire to move
toward a thing: or is it not so? "It is my own act." But to desire to move away
from a thing, whose act is that? This also is your act. "What, then, if I have
attempted to walk, suppose another should hinder me." What part of you does he
hinder? does he hinder the faculty of assent? "No: but my poor body." Yes, as
he would do with a stone. "Granted; but I no longer walk." And who told you
that walking is your act free from hindrance? for I said that this only was
free from hindrance, to desire to move: but where there is need of body and its
co-operation, you have heard long ago that nothing is your own. "Granted also."
And who can compel you to desire what you do not wish? "No man." And to
propose, or intend, or in short to make use of the appearances which present
themselves, can any man compel you? "He cannot do this: but he will hinder me
when I desire from obtaining what I desire." If you desire anything which is
your own, and one of the things which cannot be hindered, how will he hinder
you? "He cannot in any way." Who, then, tells you that he who desires the
things that belong to another is free from hindrance?
    "Must I, then, not desire health?" By no means, nor anything else that
belongs to another: for what is not in your power to acquire or to keep when
you please, this belongs to another. Keep, then, far from it not only your
hands but, more than that, even your desires. If you do not, you have
surrendered yourself as a slave; you have subjected your neck, if you admire
anything not your own, to everything that is dependent on the power of others
and perishable, to which you have conceived a liking. "Is not my hand my own?"
It is a part of your own body; but it is by nature earth, subject to hindrance,
compulsion, and the slave of everything which is stronger. And why do I say
your hand? You ought to possess your whole body as a poor ass loaded, as long
as it is possible, as long as you are allowed. But if there be a press, and a
soldier should lay hold of it, let it go, do not resist, nor murmur; if you do,
you will receive blows, and nevertheless you will also lose the ass. But when
you ought to feel thus with respect to the body, consider what remains to be
done about all the rest, which is provided for the sake of the body. When the
body is an ass, all the other things are bits belonging to the ass,
pack-saddles, shoes, barley, fodder. Let these also go: get rid of them quicker
and more readily than of the ass.
    When you have made this preparation, and have practiced this discipline, to
distinguish that which belongs to another from that which is your own, the
things which are subject to hindrance from those which are not, to consider the
things free from hindrance to concern yourself, and those which are not free
not to concern yourself, to keep your desire steadily fixed to the things which
do concern yourself, and turned from the things which do not concern yourself;
do you still fear any man? "No one." For about what will you be afraid? about
the things which are your own, in which consists the nature of good and evil?
and who has power over these things? who can take them away? who can impede
them? No man can, no more than he can impede God. But will you be afraid about
your body and your possessions, about things which are not yours, about things
which in no way concern you? and what else have you been studying from the
beginning than to distinguish between your own and not your own, the things
which are in your power and not in your power, the things subject to hindrance
and not subject? and why have you come to the philosophers? was it that you may
nevertheless be unfortunate and unhappy? You will then in this way, as I have
supposed you to have done, be without fear and disturbance. And what is grief
to you? for fear comes from what you expect, but grief from that which is
present. But what further will you desire? For of the things which are within
the power of the will, as being good and present, you have a proper and
regulated desire: but of the things which are not in the power of the will you
do not desire any one, and so you do not allow any place to that which is
irrational, and impatient, and above measure hasty.
    When, then, you are thus affected toward things, what man can any longer be
formidable to you? For what has a man which is formidable to another, either
when you see him or speak to him or, finally, are conversant with him? Not more
than one horse has with respect to another, or one dog to another, or one bee
to another bee. Things, indeed, are formidable to every man; and when any man
is able to confer these things on another or to take them away, then he too
becomes formidable. How then is an acropolis demolished? Not by the sword, not
by fire, but by opinion. For if we abolish the acropolis which is in the city,
can we abolish also that of fever, and that of beautiful women? Can we, in a
word, abolish the acropolis which is in us and cast out the tyrants within us,
whom we have dally over us, sometimes the same tyrants, at other times
different tyrants? But with this we must begin, and with this we must demolish
the acropolis and eject the tyrants, by giving up the body, the parts of it,
the faculties of it, the possessions, the reputation, magisterial offices,
honours, children, brothers, friends, by considering all these things as
belonging to others. And if tyrants have been ejected from us, why do I still
shut in the acropolis by a wall of circumvallation, at least on my account; for
if it still stands, what does it do to me? why do I still eject guards? For
where do I perceive them? against others they have their fasces, and their
spears, and their swords. But I have never been hindered in my will, nor
compelled when I did not will. And how is this possible? I have placed my
movements toward action in obedience to God. Is it His will that I shall have
fever? It is my will also. Is it His will that I should move toward anything?
It is my will also. Is it His will that I should obtain anything? It is my wish
also. Does He not will? I do not wish. Is it His will that I be put to the
rack? It is my will then to die; it is my will then to be put to the rack. Who,
then, is still able to hinder me contrary to my own judgement, or to compel me?
No more than he can hinder or compel Zeus.
    Thus the more cautious of travelers also act. A traveler has heard that the
road is infested by robbers; he does not venture to enter on it alone, but he
waits for the companionship on the road either of an ambassador, or of a
quaestor, or of a proconsul, and when he has attached himself to such persons
he goes along the road safely. So in the world the wise man acts. There are
many companies of robbers, tyrants, storms, difficulties, losses of that which
is dearest. "Where is there any place of refuge? how shall he pass along
without being attacked by robbers? what company shall he wait for that he may
pass along in safety? to whom shall he attach himself? To what person
generally? to the rich man, to the man of consular rank? and what is the use of
that to me? Such a man is stripped himself, groans and laments. But what if the
fellow-companion himself turns against me and becomes my robber, what shall I
do? I will be 'a friend of Caesar': when I am Caesar's companion no man will
wrong me. In the first place, that I may become illustrious, what things must I
endure and suffer? how often and by how many must I he robbed? Then, if I
become Caesar's friend, he also is mortal. And if Caesar from any circumstance
becomes my enemy, where is it best for me to retire? Into a desert? Well, does
fever not come there? What shall be done then? Is it not possible to find a
safe fellow traveler, a faithful one, strong, secure against all surprises?"
Thus he considers and perceives that if he attaches himself to God, he will
make his journey in safety.
    "How do you understand 'attaching yourself to God'?" In this sense, that
whatever God wills, a man also shall will; and what God does not will, a man
shall not will. How, then, shall this he done? In what other way than by
examining the movements of God and his administration What has He given to me
as my own and in my own power? what has He reserved to Himself? He has given to
me the things which are in the power of the will: He has put them in my power
free from impediment and hindrance. How was He able to make the earthly body
free from hindrance? And accordingly He has subjected to the revolution of the
whole, possessions, household things, house, children, wife. Why, then, do I
fight against God? why do I will what does not depend on the will? why do I
will to have absolutely what is not granted to ma? But how ought I to will to
have things? In the way in which they are given and as long as they are given.
But He who has given takes away. Why then do I resist? I do not say that I
shall be fool if I use force to one who is stronger, but I shall first be
unjust. For whence had I things when I came into the world? My father gave them
to me. And who gave them to him? and who made the sun? and who made the fruits
of the earth? and who the seasons? and who made the connection of men with one
another and their fellowship?
    Then after receiving everything from another and even yourself, are you
angry and do you blame the Giver if he takes anything from you? Who are you,
and for what purpose did you come into the world? Did not He introduce you
here, did He not show you the light, did he not give you fellow-workers, and
perception, and reason? and as whom did He introduce you here? did He not
introduce you as a subject to death, and as one to live on the earth with a
little flesh, and to observe His administration, and to join with Him in the
spectacle and the festival for a short time? Will you not, then, as long as you
have been permitted, after seeing the spectacle and the solemnity, when he
leads you out, go with adoration of Him and thanks for what you have seen, and
heard? "No; but I would, still enjoy the feast." The initiated, too, would wish
to be longer in the initiation: and perhaps also those, at Olympia to see other
athletes; but the solemnity is ended: go away like a grateful and modest man;
make room for others: others also must be born, as you were, and being born
they must have a place, and houses and necessary things. And if the first do
not retire, what remains? Why ire you insatiable? Why are you not content? why
do you contract the world? "Yes, but I would have my little children with me
and my wife." What, are they yours? do they not belong to the Giver, and to Him
who made you? then will you not give up what belongs to others? will you not
give way to Him who is superior? "Why, then, did He introduce me into the world
on these conditions," And if the conditions do not suit you depart. He has no
need of a spectator who is not satisfied. He wants those who join in the
festival, those who take part in the chorus, that they may rather applaud,
admire, and celebrate with hymns the solemnity. But those who can bear no
trouble, and the cowardly He will not willingly see absent from the great
assembly; for they did not when they were present behave as they ought to do at
a festival nor fill up their place properly, but they lamented, found fault
with the deity, fortune, their companions; not seeing both what they had. and
their own powers, which they received for contrary purposes, the powers of
magnanimity, of a generous mind, manly spirit, and what we are now inquiring
about, freedom. "For what purpose, then, have I received these things? To use
them. "How long;" So long as He who his lent them chooses. "What if they are
necessary to me?" Do not attach yourself to them and they will not be
necessary: do not say to yourself that they are necessary, and then they are
not necessary.
    This study you ought to practice from morning to evening, beginning, with
the smallest things and those most liable to damage, with an earthen pot, with
a cup. Then proceed in this way to a tunic to a little dog, to a horse, to a
small estate in land: then to yourself, to your body, to the parts of your
body, to your brothers. Look all round and throw these things from you. Purge
your opinions so that nothing cleave to you of the things which are not your
own, that nothing grow to you, that nothing give you pain when it is torn from
you; and say, while you are daily exercising yourself as you do there, not that
you are philosophizing, for this is an arrogant expression, but that you are
presenting an asserter of freedom: for this is really freedom. To this freedom
Diogenes was called by Antisthenes, and he said that he could no longer be
enslaved by any man. For this reason when he was taken prisoner, how did he
behave to the pirates? Did he call any of them master? and I do not speak of
the name, for I am not afraid of the word, but of the state of mind by which
the word is produced. How did he reprove them for feeding badly their captives?
How was he sold? Did he seek a master? no; but a slave, And, when he was sold,
how did he behave to his master? Immediately he disputed with him and said to
his master that he ought not to be dressed as he was, nor shaved in such a
manner; and about the children he told them how he ought to bring them up. And
what was strange in this? for if his master had bought an exercise master,
would he have employed him in the exercises of the palaestra as a servant or as
a master? and so if he had bought a physician or an architect. And so, in every
matter, it is absolutely necessary that he who has skill must be the superior
of him who has not. Whoever, then, generally possesses the science of life,
what else must he be than master? For who is master of a ship? "The man who
governs the helm." Why? Because he who will not obey him suffers for it. "But a
master can give me stripes." Can he do it, then, without suffering for it?' "So
I also used to think." But because he can not do it without suffering for it,
for this reason it is not in his power: and no man can do what is unjust
without suffering for it. "And what is the penalty for him who puts his own
slave in chains, what do you think that is?" The fact of putting the slave in
chains: and you also will admit this, if you choose to maintain the truth, that
man is not a wild beast, but a tame animal. For when is a a vine doing badly?
When it is in a condition contrary to its nature. When is a cock? Just the
same. Therefore a man also is so. What then is a man's nature? To bite, to
kick, and to throw into prison and to behead? No; but to do good, to co-operate
with others, to wish them well. At that time, then, he is in a bad condition,
whether you choose to admit it or not, when he is acting foolishly.
    "Socrates, then, did not fare badly?" No; but his judges aid his accusers
did. "Nor did Helvidius at Rome fare badly?" No; but his murderer did. "How do
you mean?" The same as you do when you say that a cock has not fared badly when
he has gained the victory and been severely wounded; but that the cock has
fared badly when he has been defeated and is unhurt: nor do you call a dog
fortunate who neither pursues game nor labors, but when you see him sweating,
when you see him in pain and panting violently after running. What paradox do
we utter if we say that the evil in everything's that which is contrary to the
nature of the thing? Is that a paradox? for do you not say this in the case of
all other things? Why then in the case of man only do you think differently,
But because we say that the nature of man is tame and social and faithful, you
will not say that this is a paradox? "It is not." What then is it a paradox to
say that a man is not hurt when he is whipped, or put in chains, or beheaded?
does he not, if he suffers nobly, come off even with increased advantage and
profit? But is he not hurt, who suffers in a most pitiful and disgraceful way,
who in place of a man becomes a wolf, or viper or wasp?
    Well then let us recapitulate the things which have been agreed on. The man
who is not under restraint is free, to whom things are exactly in that state in
which he wishes them to be; but he who can be restrained or compelled or
hindered, or thrown into any circumstances against his will, is a slave. But
who is free from restraint? He who desires nothing that belongs to others. And
what are the things which belong to others? Those which are not in our power
either to have or not to have, or to have of a certain kind or in a certain
manner. Therefore the body belongs to another, the parts of the body belong to
another, possession belongs to another. If, then, you are attached to any of
these things as your own, you will pay the penalty which it is proper for him
to pay who desires what belongs to another. This road leads to freedom, that is
the only way of escaping from slavery, to be able to say at last with all your
soul
       Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O destiny,
       The way that I am bid by you to go.
But what do you say, philosopher? The tyrant summons you to say something which
does not become you. Do you say it or do you not? Answer me. "Let me consider."
Will you consider now? But when you were in the school, what was it which you
used to consider? Did you not study what are the things that are good and what
are bad, and what things are neither one nor the other? "I did." What then was
our opinion? "That just and honourable acts were good; and that unjust and
disgraceful acts were bad." Is life a good thing? "No." Is death a bad thing?
"No." Is prison? "No." But what did we think about mean and faithless words and
betrayal of a friend and flattery of a tyrant? "That they are bad." Well then,
you are not considering, nor have you considered nor deliberated. For what is
the matter for consideration: is it whether it is becoming for me, when I have
it in my power, to secure for myself the greatest of good things, and not to
secure for myself the greatest evils? A fine inquiry indeed, and necessary, and
one that demands much deliberation. Man, why do you mock us? Such an inquiry is
never made. If you really imagined that base things were bad and honourable
things were good, and that all other things were neither good nor bad, you
would not even have approached this inquiry, nor have come near it; but
immediately you would have been able to distinguish them by the understanding
as you would do by the vision. For when do you inquire if black things are
white, if heavy things are light, and do not comprehend the manifest evidence
of the senses? How, then, do you now say that you are considering whether
things which are neither good nor bad ought to be avoided more than things
which are bad? But you do not possess these opinions; and neither do these
things seem to you to he neither good nor bad, but you think that they are the
greatest evils; nor do you think those other things to be evils, but matters
which do not concern us at all. For thus from the beginning you have accustomed
yourself. "Where am I? In the schools: and are any listening to me? I am
discoursing among philosophers. But I have gone out of the school. Away with
this talk of scholars and fools." Thus a friend is overpowered by the testimony
of a philosopher: thus a philosopher becomes a parasite; thus he lets himself
for hire for money: thus in the senate a man does not say what he thinks; in
private he proclaims his opinions. You are a cold and miserable little opinion,
suspended from idle words as from a hair. But keep yourself strong and fit for
the uses of life and initiated by being exercised in action. How do you hear? I
do not say that your child is dead- for how could you bear that?- but that your
oil is spilled, your wine drunk up. Do you act in such a way that one standing
by you while you are making a great noise, may say this only, "Philosopher, you
say something different in the school. Why do you deceive us? Why, when you are
only a worm, do you say that you are a man?" I should like to be present when
one of the philosophers is lying with a woman, that I might see how he is
exerting himself, and what words he is uttering, and whether he remembers his
title of philosopher, and the words which he hears or says or reads.
    "And what is this to liberty?" Nothing else than this, whether you who are
rich choose or not. "And who is your evidence for this?" who else than
yourselves? who have a powerful master, and who live in obedience to his nod
and motion, and who faint if he only looks at you with a scowling countenance;
you who court old women and old men, and say, "I cannot do this: it is not in
my power." Why is it not in your power? Did you not lately contend with me and
say that you are free "But Aprulla has hindered me." Tell the truth, then,
slave, and do not run away from your masters, nor deny, nor venture to produce
any one to assert your freedom, when you have so many evidences of your
slavery. And indeed when a man is compelled by love to do something contrary to
his opinion, and at the same time sees the better but has not the strength to
follow it, one might consider him still more worthy of excuse as being held by
a certain violent and, in a manner, a divine power. But who could endure you
who are in love with old women and old men, and wipe the old women's noses, and
wash them and give them presents, and also wait on them like a slave when they
are sick, and at the same time wish them dead, and question the physicians
whether they are sick unto death? And again, when in order to obtain these
great and much admired magistracies and honours, you kiss the hands of these
slaves of others, and so you are not the slave even of free men. Then you walk
about before me in stately fashion, praetor or a consul. Do I not know how you
became a praetor, by what means you got your consulship, who gave it to you? I
would not even choose to live, if I must live by help of Felicion and endure
his arrogance and servile insolence: for I know what a slave is, who is
fortunate, as he thinks, and puffed up by pride.
    "You then," a man may say, "are you free?" I wish, by the Gods, and pray to
be free; but I am not yet able to face my masters, I still value my poor body,
I value greatly the preservation of it entire, though I do not possess it
entire. But I can point out to you a free man, that you may no longer seek an
example. Diogenes was free. How was he free?- not because he was born of free
parents, but because he was himself free, because he had cast off all the
handles of slavery, and it was not possible for any man to approach him, nor
had any man the means of laying hold of him to enslave him. He had everything
easily loosed, everything only hanging to him. If you laid hold of his
property, he would rather have let it go and be yours than he would have
followed you for it: if you had laid hold of his leg, he would have let go his
leg; if of all his body, all his poor body; his intimates, friends, country,
just the same. For he knew from whence he had them, and from whom, and on what
conditions. His true parents indeed, the Gods, and his real country he would
never have deserted, nor would he have yielded to any man in obedience to them
or to their orders, nor would any man have died for his country more readily.
For he was not used to inquire when he should be considered to have done
anything on behalf of the whole of things, but he remembered that everything
which is done comes from thence and is done on behalf of that country and is
commanded by him who administers it. Therefore see what Diogenes himself says
and writes: "For this reason," he says, "Diogenes, it is in your power to speak
both with the King of the Persians and with Archidamus the king of the
Lacedaemonians, as you please." Was it because he was born of free parents? I
suppose all the Athenians and all the Lacedaemonians, because they were born of
slaves, could not talk with them as they wished, but feared and paid court to
them. Why then does he say that it is in his power? "Because I do not consider
the poor body to be my own, because I want nothing, because law is everything
to me, and nothing else is." These were the things which permitted him to be
free.
    And that you may not think that I show you the example of a man who is a
solitary person, who has neither wife nor children, nor country, nor friends
nor kinsmen, by whom he could be bent and drawn in various directions, take
Socrates and observe that he had a wife and children, but he did not consider
them as his own; that he had a country, so long as it was fit to have one, and
in such a manner as was fit; friends and kinsmen also, but he held all in
subjection to law and to the obedience due to it. For this reason he was the
first to go out as a soldier, when it was necessary; and in war he exposed
himself to danger most unsparingly, and when he was sent by the tyrants to
seize Leon, he did not even deliberate about the matter, because he thought
that it was a base action, and he knew that he must die, if it so happened. And
what difference did that make to him? for he intended to preserve something
else, not his poor flesh, but his fidelity, his honourable character. These are
things which could not be assailed nor brought into subjection. Then, when he
was obliged to speak in defense of his life, did he behave like a man who had
children, who had a wife? No, but he behaved like a man who has neither. And
what did he do when he was to drink the poison, and when he had the power of
escaping from prison, and when Crito said to him, "Escape for the sake of your
children," what did Socrates say? Did he consider the power of escape as an
unexpected gain? By no means: he considered what was fit and proper; but the
rest he did not even look at or take into the reckoning. For he did not choose,
he said, to save his poor body, but to save that which is increased and saved
by doing what is just, and is impaired and destroyed by doing what is unjust.
Socrates will not save his life by a base act; he who would not put the
Athenians to the vote when they clamoured that he should do so, he who refused
to obey the tyrants, he who discoursed in such a manner about virtue and right
behavior. It is not possible to save such a man's life by base acts, but he is
saved by dying, not by running away. For the good actor also preserves his
character by stopping when he ought to stop, better than when he goes on acting
beyond the proper time. What then shall the children of Socrates do? "If," said
Socrates, "I had gone off to Thessaly, would you have taken care of them; and
if I depart to the world below, will there be no man to take care of them?" See
how he gives to death a gentle name and mocks it. But if you and I had been in
his place, we should have immediately answered as philosophers that those who
act unjustly must be repaid in the same way, and we should have added, "I shall
be useful to many, if my life is saved, and if I die, I shall be useful to no
man." For, if it had been necessary, we should have made our escape by slipping
through a small hole. And how in that case should we have been useful to any
man? for where would they have been then staying? or if we were useful to men
while we were alive, should we not have been much more useful to them by dying
when we ought to die, and as we ought? And now, Socrates being dead, no less
useful to men, and even more useful, is the remembrance of that which he did or
said when he was alive.
    Think of these things, these opinions, these words: look to these examples,
if you would be free, if you desire the thing according to its worth. And what
is the wonder if you buy so great a thing at the price of things so many and so
great? For the sake of this which is called "liberty," some hang themselves,
others throw themselves down precipices, and sometimes even whole cities have
perished: and will you not for the sake of the true and unassailable and secure
liberty give back to God when He demands them the things which He has given?
Will you not, as Plato says, study not to die only, but also to endure torture,
and exile, and scourging, and, in a word, to give up all which is not your own?
If you will not, you will be a slave among slaves, even you be ten thousand
times a consul; and if you make your way up to the Palace, you will no less be
a slave; and you will feel, that perhaps philosophers utter words which are
contrary to common opinion, as Cleanthes also said, but not words contrary to
reason. For you will know by experience that the words are true, and that there
is no profit from the things which are valued and eagerly sought to those who
have obtained them; and to those who have not yet obtained them there is an
imagination that when these things are come, all that is good will come with
them; then, when they are come, the feverish feeling is the same, the tossing
to and fro is the same, the satiety, the desire of things which are not
present; for freedom is acquired not by the full possession of the things which
are desired, but by removing the desire. And that you may know that this is
true, as you have laboured for those things, so transfer your labour to these;
be vigilant for the purpose of acquiring an opinion which will make you free;
pay court to a philosopher instead of to a rich old man: be seen about a
philosopher's doors: you will not disgrace yourself by being seen; you will not
go away empty nor without profit, if you go to the philosopher as you ought,
and if not, try at least: the trial is not disgraceful.

Chapter 2

On familiar intimacy

    To This matter before all you must attend: that you be never so closely
connected with any of your former intimates or friends as to come down to the
same acts as he does. If you do not observe this rule, you will ruin yourself.
But if the thought arises in your mind. "I shall seem disobliging to him, and
he will not have the same feeling toward me," remember that nothing is done
without cost, nor is it possible for a man if he does not do the same to be the
same man that he was. Choose, then, which of the two you will have, to be
equally loved by those by whom you were formerly loved, being the same with
your former self; or, being superior, not to obtain from your friends the same
that you did before. For if this is better, turn away to it, and let not other
considerations draw you in a different direction. For no man is able to make
progress, when he is wavering between opposite things, but if you have
preferred this to all things, if you choose to attend to this only, to work out
this only, give up everything else. But if you will not do this, your wavering
will produce both these results: you will neither improve as you ought, nor
will you obtain what you formerly obtained. For before, by plainly desiring the
things which were worth nothing, you pleased your associates. But you cannot
excel in both kinds, and it is necessary that so far as you share in the one,
you must fall short in the other. You cannot, when you do not drink with those
with whom you used to drink, he agreeable to them as you were before. Choose,
then, whether you will be a hard drinker and pleasant to your former associates
or a sober man and disagreeable to them. You cannot, when you do not sing with
those with whom you used to sing, be equally loved by them. Choose, then, in
this matter also which of the two you will have. For if it is better to be
modest and orderly than for a man to say, "He is a jolly fellow," give up the
rest, renounce it, turn away from it, have nothing to do with such men. But if
this behavior shall not please you, turn altogether to the opposite: become a
catamite, an adulterer, and act accordingly, and you will get what you wish.
And jump up in the theatre and bawl out in praise of the dancer. But characters
so different cannot be mingled: you cannot act both Thersites and Agamemnon. If
you intend to be Thersites, you must be humpbacked and bald: if Agamemnon, you
must be tall and handsome, and love those who are placed in obedience to you.

Chapter 3

What things we should exchange for other things

    Keep this thought in readiness, when you lose anything external, what you
acquire in place of it; and if it be worth more, never say, "I have had a
loss"; neither if you have got a horse in place of an ass, or an ox in place of
a sheep, nor a good action in place of a bit of money, nor in place of idle
talk such tranquillity as befits a man, nor in place of lewd talk if you have
acquired modesty. If you remember this, you will always maintain your character
such as it ought to be. But if you do not, consider that the times of
opportunity are perishing, and that whatever pains you take about yourself, you
are going to waste them all and overturn them. And it needs only a few things
for the loss and overturning of all, namely a small deviation from reason. For
the steerer of a ship to upset it, he has no need of the same means as he has
need of for saving it: but if he turns it a little to the wind, it is lost; and
if he does not do this purposely, but has been neglecting his duty a little,
the ship is lost. Something of the kind happens in this case also: if you only
fall to nodding a little, all that you have up to this time collected is gone.
Attend therefore to the appearances of things, and watch over them; for that
which you have to preserve is no small matter, but it is modesty and fidelity
and constancy, freedom from the affects, a state of mind undisturbed, freedom
from fear, tranquillity, in a word, "liberty." For what will you sell these
things? See what is the value of the things which you will obtain in exchange
for these. "But shall I not obtain any such thing for it?" See, and if you do
in return get that, see what you receive in place of it. "I possess decency, he
possesses a tribuneship: be possesses a praetorship, I possess modesty. But I
do not make acclamations where it is not becoming: I will not stand up where I
ought not; for I am free, and a friend of God, and so I obey Him willingly. But
I must not claim anything else, neither body nor possession, nor magistracy,
nor good report, nor in fact anything. For He does not allow me to claim them:
for if He had chosen, He would have made them good for me; but He has not done
so, and for this reason I cannot transgress his commands." Preserve that which
is your own good in everything; and as to every other thing, as it is
permitted, and so far as to behave consistently with reason in respect to them,
content with this only. If you do not, you will be unfortunate, you will fall
in all things, you will be hindered, you will be impeded. These are the laws
which have been sent from thence; these are the orders. Of these laws a man
ought to be an expositor, to these he ought to submit, not to those of Masurius
and Cassius.

Chapter 4

To those who are desirous of passing life in tranquility

    Remember that not only the desire of power and of riches makes us mean and
subject to others, but even the desire of tranquillity, and of leisure. and of
traveling abroad, and of learning. For, to speak plainly, whatever the external
thing may be, the value which we set upon it places us in subjection to others.
What, then, is the difference between desiring, to be a senator or not desiring
to be one; what is the difference between desiring power or being content with
a private station; what is the difference between saying, "I am unhappy, I have
nothing, to do, but I am bound to my books as a corpse"; or saying, "I am
unhappy, I have no leisure for reading"? For as salutations and power are
things external and independent of the will, so is a book. For what purpose do
you choose to read? Tell me. For if you only direct your purpose to being
amused or learning something, you are a silly fellow and incapable of enduring
labour. But if you refer reading to the proper end, what else is this than a
tranquil and happy life? But if reading does not secure for you a happy and
tranquil life, what is the use of it? But it does secure this," the man
replies, "and for this reason I am vexed that I am deprived of it." And what is
this tranquil and happy life, which any man can impede; I do not say Caesar or
Caesar's friend, but a crow, a piper, a fever, and thirty thousand other
things? But a tranquil and happy life contains nothing so sure is continuity
and freedom from obstacle. Now I am called to do something: I will go, then,
with the purpose of observing the measures which I must keep, of acting with
modesty, steadiness, without desire and aversion to things external; and then
that I may attend to men, what they say, how they are moved; and this not with
any bad disposition, or that I may have something to blame or to ridicule; but
I turn to myself, and ask if I also commit the same faults. "How then shall I
cease to commit them?" Formerly I also acted wrong, but now I do not: thanks to
God.
    Come, when you have done these things and have attended to them, have you
done a worse act than when you have read a thousand verses or written as many?
For when you eat, are you grieved because you are not reading? are you not
satisfied with eating according to what you have learned by reading, and so
with bathing and with exercise? Why, then, do you not act consistently in all
things, both when you approach Caesar and when you approach any person? If you
maintain yourself free from perturbation, free from alarm, and steady; if you
look rather at the things which are done and happen than are looked at
yourself; if you do not envy those who are preferred before you; if surrounding
circumstances do not strike you with fear or admiration, what do you want?
Books? How or for what purpose? for is not this a preparation for life? and is
not life itself made up of certain other things than this? This is just as if
an athlete should weep when he enters the stadium, because he is not being
exercised outside of it. It was for this purpose that you used to practice
exercise; for this purpose were used the halteres, the dust, the young men as
antagonists; and do you seek for those things now when it is the time of
action? This is just as if in the topic of assent when appearances present
themselves, some of which can he comprehended, and some cannot be comprehended,
we should not choose to distinguish them but should choose to read what has
been written about comprehension.
    What then is the reason of this? The reason is that we have never read for
this purpose, we have never written for this purpose, so that we may in our
actions use in a way conformable to nature the appearances presented to us; but
we terminate in this, in learning what is said, and in being able to expound it
to another, in resolving a syllogism, and in handling the hypothetical
syllogism. For this reason where our study is, there alone is the impediment.
Would you have by all means the things which are not in your power? Be
prevented then, be hindered, fail in your purpose. But if we read what is
written about action, not that we may see what is said about action, but that
we may act well: if we read what is said about desire and aversion, in order
that we may neither fall in our desires, nor fall into that which we try to
avoid: if we read what is said about duty, in order that, remembering the
relations, we may do nothing irrationally nor contrary to these relations; we
should not be vexed in being hindered as to our readings, but we should be
satisfied with doing, the acts which are conformable, and we should be
reckoning not what so far we have been accustomed to reckon; "To-day I have
read so many verses, I have written so many"; but, "To-day I have employed my
action as it is taught by the philosophers; I have not employed any desire; I
have used avoidance only with respect to things which are within the power of
my will; I have not been afraid of such a person, I have not been prevailed
upon by the entreaties of another; I have exercised my patience, my abstinence
my co-operation with others"; and so we should thank God for what we ought to
thank Him.
    But now we do not know that we also in another way are like the many.
Another man is afraid that he shall not have power: you are afraid that you
will. Do not do so, my man; but as you ridicule him who is afraid that he,
shall not have power, so ridicule yourself also. For it makes no difference
whether you are thirsty like a man who has a fever, or have a dread of water
like a man who is mad. Or how will you still be able to say as Socrates did,
"If so it pleases God, so let it be"? Do you think that Socrates, if he had
been eager to pass his leisure in the Lyceum or in the Academy and to discourse
dally with the young men, would have readily served in military expeditions so
often as he did; and would he not have lamented and groaned, "Wretch that I am;
I must now be miserable here, when I might be sunning myself in the Lyceum"?
Why, was this your business, to sun yourself? And is it not your business to be
happy, to be free from hindrance, free from impediment? And could he still have
been Socrates, if he had lamented in this way: how would he still have been
able to write Paeans in his prison?
    In short, remember this, that what you shall prize which is beyond your
will, so far you have destroyed your will. But these things are out of the
power of the will, not only power, but also a private condition: not only
occupation, but also leisure. "Now, then, must I live in this tumult?" Why do
you say "tumult"? "I mean among many men." Well what is the hardship? Suppose
that you are at Olympia: imagine it to be a panegyris, where one is calling out
one thing, another is doing another thing, and a third is pushing another
person: in the baths there is a crowd: and who of us is not pleased with this
assembly and leaves it unwillingly, Be not difficult to please nor fastidious
about what happens. "Vinegar is disagreeable, for it is sharp; honey is
disagreeable, for it disturbs my habit of body. I do not like vegetables." So
also, "I do not like leisure; it is a desert: I do not like a crowd; it is
confusion." But if circumstances make it necessary for you to live alone or
with a few, call it quiet and use the thing as you ought: talk with yourself,
exercise the appearances, work up your preconceptions. If you fall into a
crowd, call it a celebration of games, a panegyris, a festival: try to enjoy
the festival with other men. For what is a more pleasant sight to him who loves
mankind than a number of men? We see with pleasure herds of horses or oxen: we
are delighted when we see many ships: who is pained when he sees many men? "But
they deafen me with their cries." Then your hearing is impeded. What, then, is
this to you? Is, then, the power of making use of appearances hindered? And who
prevents you from using, according to nature, inclination to a thing and
aversion from it; and movement toward a thing and movement from it? What tumult
is able to do this?
    Do you only bear in mind the general rules: "What is mine, what is not
mine; what is given to me; what does God will that I should do now? what does
He not will?" A little before he willed you to be at leisure, to talk with
yourself, to write about these things, to read, to hear, to prepare yourself.
You had sufficient time for this. Now He says to you: "Come now to the contest;
show us what you have learned, how you have practiced the athletic art. How
long will you be exercised alone? Now is the opportunity for you to learn
whether you are an athlete worthy of victory, or one of those who go about the
world and are defeated." Why, then, are; you vexed? No contest is without
confusion. There be many who exercise themselves for the contests, many who
call out to those who exercise themselves, many masters, many spectators. "But
my wish is to live quietly." Lament, then, and groan as you deserve to do. For
what other is a greater punishment than this to the untaught man and to him who
disobeys the divine commands: to be grieved, to lament, to envy, in a word, to
be disappointed and to he unhappy? Would you not release yourself from these
things? "And how shall I release myself?" Have you not often heard that you
ought to remove entirely desire, apply aversion to those things only which are
within your power, that you ought to give up everything, body, property, fame,
books, tumult, power, private station? for whatever way you turn, you are a
slave, you are subjected, you are hindered, you are compelled, you are entirely
in the power of others. But keep the words of Cleanthes in readiness,
       Lead me, O Zeus, and thou necessity.
    Is it your will that I should go to Rome? I will go to Rome. To Gyara? I
will go to Gyara. I will go to Athens? I will go to Athens. To prison? I will
go to prison. If you should once say, "When shall a man go to Athens?" you are
undone. It is a necessary consequence that this desire, if it is not
accomplished, must make you unhappy; and if it is accomplished, it must make
you vain, since you are elated at things at which you ought not to be elated;
and on the other hand, if you are impeded, it must make you wretched because
you fall into that which you would not fall into. Give up then all these
things. "Athens is a good place." But happiness is much better; and to be free
from passions, free from disturbance, for your affairs not to depend on any
man. "There is tumult at Rome and visits of salutation." But happiness is an
equivalent for all troublesome things. If, then, the time comes for these
things, why do you not take away the wish to avoid them? what necessity is
there to carry to avoid a burden like an ass, and to be beaten with a stick?
But if you do not so, consider that you must always be a slave to him who has
it in his power to effect your release, and also to impede you, and you must
serve him as an evil genius.
    There is only one way to happiness, and let this rule be ready both in the
morning and during the day and by night; the rule is not to look toward things
which are out of the power of our will, to think that nothing is our own, to
give up all things to the Divinity, to Fortune; to make them the
superintendents of these things, whom Zeus also has made so; for a man to
observe that only which is his own, that which cannot be hindered; and when we
read, to refer our reading to this only, and our writing and our listening. For
this reason, I cannot call the man industrious, if I hear this only, that he
reads and writes; and even if a man adds that he reads all night, I cannot say
so, if he knows not to what he should refer his reading. For neither do you say
that a man is industrious if he keeps awake for a girl; nor do I. But if he
does it for reputation, I say that he is a lover of reputation. And if he does
it for money, I say that he is a lover of money, not a lover of labour; and if
he does it through love of learning, I say that he is a lover of learning. But
if he refers his labour to his own ruling power, that he may keep it in a state
conformable to nature and pass his life in that state, then only do I say that
he is industrious. For never commend a man on account of these things which are
common to all, but on account of his opinions; for these are the things which
belong to each man, which make his actions bad or good. Remembering these
rules, rejoice in that which is present, and be content with the things which
come in season. If you see anything which you have learned and inquired about
occurring, to you in your course of life, be delighted at it. If you have laid
aside or have lessened bad disposition and a habit of reviling; if you have
done so with rash temper, obscene words, hastiness, sluggishness; if you are
not moved by what you formerly were, and not in the same way as you once were,
you can celebrate a festival daily, to-day because you have behaved well in one
act, and to-morrow because you have behaved well in another. How much greater
is this a reason for making sacrifices than a consulship or the government of a
province? These things come to you from yourself and from the gods. Remember
this, Who gives these things and to whom, and for what purpose. If you cherish
yourself in these thoughts, do you still think that it makes any difference
where yon shall be happy, where you shall please God? Are not the gods equally
distant from all places? Do they not see from all places alike that which is
going on?

Chapter 5

Against the quarrelsome and ferocious

    The wise and good man neither himself fights with any person, nor does he
allow another, so far as he can prevent it. And an example of this as well as
of all other things is proposed to us in the life of Socrates, who not only
himself on all occasions avoided fights, but would not allow even others to
quarrel. See in Xenophon's Symposium how many quarrels he settled; how further
he endured Thrasymachus and Polus and Callicles; how he tolerated his wife, and
how he tolerated his son who attempted to confute him aid to cavil with him.
For he remembered well that no man has in his power another man's ruling
principle. He wished, therefore nothing else than that which was his own. And
what is this? Not that this or that man may act according to nature; for that
is a thing which belongs to another; but that while others are doing their own
acts, as they choose, he may never the less be in a condition conformable to
nature and live in it, only doing what is his own to the end that others also
may be in a state conformable to nature. For this is the object always set
before him by the wise and good man. Is it to be commander of an army? No: but
if it is permitted him, his object is in this matter to maintain his own ruling
principle. Is it to marry? No; but if marriage is allowed to him, in this
matter his object is to maintain himself in a condition conformable to nature.
But if he would have his son not to do wrong, or his wife, he would have what
belongs to another not to belong to another; and to he instructed is this: to
learn what things are a man's own and what belongs to another.
    How, then, is there left any place for fighting, to a man who has this
opinion? Is he surprised at anything which happens, and does it appear new to
him? Does he not expect that which comes from the bad to be worse and more
grievous than what actually befalls him? And does he not reckon as pure gain
whatever they may do which falls short of extreme wickedness? "Such a person
has reviled you." Great thanks to him for not having, struck you. "But he has
struck me also." Great thanks that he did not wound you "But he wounded me
also." Great thanks that he did not kill you. For when did he learn or in what
school that man is a tame animal, that men love one another, that an act of
injustice is a great harm to him who does it. Since then he has not to him who
does it. Since then he has not learned this and is not convinced of it, why
shall he not follow that which seems to be for his own "Your neighbour has
thrown stones." Have you then done anything wrong? "But the things in the house
have been broken." Are you then a utensil? No; but a free power of will. What,
then, is given to you in answer to this? If you are like a wolf, you must bite
in return, and throw more stones. But if you consider what is proper for a man,
examine your store-house, see with at faculties you came into the world. Have
you the disposition of a wild beast, Have you the disposition of revenge for an
injury? When is a horse wretched? When he is deprived of his natural faculties;
not when he cannot crow like a cock, but when he cannot run. When is a dog
wretched? Not when he cannot fly, but when he cannot track his game. Is, then,
a man also unhappy in this way, not because he cannot strangle lions or embrace
statues, for he did not come into the world in the possession of certain powers
from nature for this purpose, but because he has lost his probity and his
fidelity? People ought to meet and lament such a man for the misfortunes into
which he has fallen; not indeed to lament because a man his been born or has
died, but because it has happened to him in his lifetime to have lost the
things which are his own, not that which he received from his father, not his
land and house, and his inn, and his slaves; for not one of these things is a
man's own, but all belong to others, are servile and subject to account, at
different times given to different persons by those who have them in their
power: but I mean the things which belong to him as a man, the marks in his
mind with which he came into the world, such as we seek also on coins, and if
we find them, we approve of the coins, and if we do not find the marks, we
reject them. What is the stamp on this Sestertius? "The stamp of Trajan."
Present it. "It is the stamp of Nero." Throw it away: it cannot be accepted, it
is counterfeit. So also in this case. What is the stamp of his opinions? "It is
gentleness, a sociable disposition, a tolerant temper, a disposition to mutual
affection." Produce these qualities. I accept them: I consider this man a
citizen, I accept him as a neighbour, a companion in my voyages. Only see that
he has not Nero's stamp. Is he passionate, is he full of resentment, is he
faultfinding? If the whim seizes him, does he break the heads of those who come
in his way? Why, then did you say that he is a man? Is everything judged by the
bare form? If that is so, say that the form in wax is all apple and has the
smell and the taste of an apple. But the external figure is not enough: neither
then is the nose enough and the eyes to make the man, but he must have the
opinions of a man. Here is a man who does not listen to reason, who does not
know when he is refuted: he is an ass: in another man the sense of shame is
become dead: he is good for nothing, he is anything rather than a man. This man
seeks whom he may meet and kick or bite, so that he is not even a sheep or an
ass, but a kind of wild beast.
    "What then would you have me to be despised?" By whom? by those who know
you? and how and how shall those who know you despise a man who is gentle and
modest? Perhaps you mean by those who do not know you? What is that to you? For
no other artisan cares for the opinion of those who know not his art. "But they
will be more hostile to me for this reason." Why do you say "me"? Can any man
injure your will, or prevent you from using in a natural way the appearances
which are presented to you, "In no way can he." Why, then, are still disturbed
and why do you choose to show yourself afraid? And why do you not come forth
and proclaim that you are at peace with all men whatever they may do, and laugh
at those chiefly who think that they can harm you? "These slaves," you can say,
"know not either who I am nor where lies my good or my evil, because they have
no access to the things which are mine."
    In this way, also, those who occupy a strong city mock the besiegers; "What
trouble these men are now taking for nothing: our wall is secure, we have food
for a very long time, and all other resources." These are the things which make
a city strong and impregnable: but nothing else than his opinions makes a man's
soul impregnable. For what wall is so strong, or what body is so hard, or what
possession is so safe, or what honour so free from assault? All things
everywhere are perishable, easily taken by assault, and, if any man in any way
is attached to them, he must be disturbed, expect what is bad, he must fear,
lament, find his desires disappointed, and fall into things which he would
avoid. Then do we not choose to make secure the only means of safety which are
offered to us, and do we not choose to withdraw ourselves from that which is
perishable and servile and to labour at the things, which are imperishable and
by nature free; and do we not remember that no man either hurts another or does
good to another, but that a man's opinion about each thing is that which hurts
him, is that which overturns him; this is fighting, this is civil discord, this
is war? That which made Eteocles and Polynices enemies was nothing else than
this opinion which they had about royal power, their opinion about exile, that
the one is the extreme of evils, the other the greatest good. Now this is the
nature of every man to seek the good, to avoid the bad; to consider him who
deprives us of the one and involves us in the other an enemy and treacherous,
even if he be a brother, or a son or a father. For nothing is more akin to us
than the good: therefore if these things are good and evil, neither is a father
a friend to sons, nor a brother to a brother, but all the world is everywhere
full of enemies, treacherous men, and sycophants. But if the will, being what
it ought to be, is the only good; and if the will, being such as it ought not
to be, is the only evil, where is there any strife, where is there reviling?
about what? about the things which do not concern us? and strife with whom?
with the ignorant, the unhappy, with those who are deceived about the chief
things?
    Remembering this Socrates managed his own house and endured a very
ill-tempered wife and a foolish son. For in what did she show her bad temper?
In pouring water on his head as much as she liked, and in trampling on the
cake. And what is this to me, if I think that these things are nothing to me?
But this is my business; and neither tyrant shall check my will nor a master;
nor shall the many check me who am only one, nor shall the stronger check me
who am the weaker; for this power of being free from check is given by God to
every man. For these opinions make love in a house, concord in a state, among
nations peace, and gratitude to God; they make a man in all things cheerful in
externals as about things which belong to others, as about things which are of
no value. We indeed are able to write and to read these things, and to praise
them when they are read, but we do not even come near to being convinced of
them. Therefore what is said of the Lacedaemonians, "Lions at home, but in
Ephesus foxes," will fit in our case also, "Lions in the school, but out of it
foxes."

Chapter 6

Against those who lament over being pitied

    "I am grieved," a man says, "at being pitied." Whether, then, is the fact
of your being pitied a thing which concerns you or those who pity you? Well, is
it in your power to stop this pity? "It is in my power, if I show them that I
do not require pity." And whether, then, are you in the condition of not
deserving pity, or are you not in that condition? "I think I am not: but these
persons do not pity me for the things for which, if they ought to pity me, it
would be proper, I mean, for my faults; but they pity me for my poverty, for
not possessing honourable offices, for diseases and deaths and other such
things." Whether, then, are you prepared to convince the many that not one of
these things is an evil, but that it is possible for a man who is poor and has
no office and enjoys no honour to be happy; or to show yourself to them as rich
and in power? For the second of these things belong, to a man who is boastful,
silly and good for nothing. And consider by what means the pretense must be
supported. It will be necessary for you to hire slaves and to possess a few
silver vessels, and to exhibit them in public, if it is possible, though they
are often the same, and to attempt to conceal the fact that they are the same,
and to have splendid garments, and all other things for display, and to show
that you are a man honoured by the great, and to try to sup at their houses, or
to be supposed to sup there, and as to your person to employ some mean arts,
that you may appear to be more handsome and nobler than you are. These things
you must contrive, if you choose to go by the second path in order not to be
pitied. But the first way is both impracticable and long, to attempt the very
thing which Zeus has not been able to do, to convince all men what things are
good and bad. Is this power given to you? This only is given to you, to
convince yourself; and you have not convinced yourself. Then I ask you, do you
attempt to persuade other men? and who has lived so long with you as you with
yourself? and who has so much power of convincing you as you have of convincing
yourself; and who is better disposed and nearer to you than you are to
yourself? How, then, have you not convinced yourself in order to learn? At
present are not things upside down? Is this what you have been earnest about
doing, to learn to be free from grief and free from disturbance, and not to be
humbled, and to be free? Have you not heard, then, that there is only one way
which leads to this end, to give up the things which do not depend on the will,
to withdraw from them, and to admit that they belong to others? For another
man, then, to have an opinion about you, of what kind is it? "It is a thing
independent of the will." Then is it nothing to you? "It is nothing." When,
then, you are still vexed at this and disturbed, do you think that you are
convinced about good and evil?
    Will you not, then, letting others alone, be to yourself both scholar and
teacher? "The rest of mankind will look after this, whether it is to their
interest to be and to pass their lives in a state contrary to nature: but to me
no man is nearer than myself. What, then, is the meaning of this, that I have
listened to the words of the philosophers and I assent to them, but in fact I
am no way made easier? Am I so stupid? And yet, in all other things such as I
have chosen, I have not been found very stupid; but I learned letters quickly,
and to wrestle, and geometry, and to resolve syllogisms. Has not, then, reason
convinced me? and indeed no other things have I from the beginning so approved
and chosen: and now I read about these things, hear about them, write about
them; I have so far discovered no reason stronger than this. In what, then, am
I deficient? Have the contrary opinions not been eradicated from me? Have the
notions themselves not been exercised nor used to be applied to action, but as
armour are laid aside and rusted and cannot fit me? And yet neither in the
exercises of the palaestra, nor in writing or reading am I satisfied with
learning, but I turn up and down the syllogisms which are proposed, and I make
others, and sophistical syllogisms also. But the necessary theorems, by
proceeding from which a man can become free from grief, fear, passions,
hindrance, and a free man, these I do not exercise myself in nor do I practice
in these the proper practice. Then I care about what others will say of me,
whether I shall appear to them worth notice, whether I shall appear happy."
    Wretched man, will you not see what you. are saying about yourself? What do
you appear to yourself to be? in your opinions, in your desires, in your
aversions from things, in your movements, in your preparation, in your designs,
and in other acts suitable to a man? But do you trouble yourself about this,
whether others pity you? "Yes, but I am pitied not as I ought to be." Are you
then pained at this? and is he who is pained, an object of pity? "Yes." How,
then, are you pitied not as you ought to be? For by the very act that you feel
about being pitied, you make yourself deserving of pity. What then says
Antisthenes? Have you not heard? "It is a royal thing, O Cyrus, to do right and
to be ill-spoken of." My head is sound, and all think that I have the headache.
What do I care for that? I am free from fever, and people sympathize with me as
if I had a fever: "Poor man, for so long a time you have not ceased to have
fever." I also say with a sorrowful countenance: "In truth it is now a long
time that I have been ill." "What will happen then?" "As God may please": and
at the same time I secretly laugh at those who are pitying me. What, then,
hinders the same being done in this case also? I am poor, but I have a right
opinion about poverty. Why, then, do I care if they pity me for my poverty? I
am not in power; but others are: and I have the opinion which I ought to have
about having and not having power. Let them look to it who pity me; but I am
neither hungry nor thirsty nor do I suffer cold; but because they are hungry or
thirsty they think that I too am. What, then, shall I do for them? Shall I go
about and proclaim and say: "Be not mistaken, men, I am very well, I do not
trouble myself about poverty, nor want of power, nor in a word about anything
else than right opinions. These I have free from restraint, I care for nothing
at all." What foolish talk is this? How do I possess right opinions when I am
not content with being what I am, but am uneasy about what I am supposed to be?
    "But," you say, "others will get more and be preferred to me." What, then,
is more reasonable than for those who have laboured about anything to have more
in that thing in which they have laboured? They have laboured for power, you
have laboured about opinions; and they have laboured for wealth, you for the
proper use of appearances. See if they have more than you in this about which
you have laboured, and which they neglect; if they assent better than you with
respect to the natural rules of things; if they are less disappointed than you
in their desires; if they fall less into things which they would avoid than you
do; if in their intentions, if in the things which they propose to themselves,
if in their purposes, if in their motions toward an object they take a better
aim; if they better observe a proper behavior, as men, as sons, as parents, and
so on as to the other names by which we express the relations of life. But if
they exercise power, and you do not, will you not choose to tell yourself the
truth, that you do nothing for the sake of this, and they do all? But it is
most unreasonable that he who looks after anything should obtain less than he
who does not look after it.
    "Not so: but since I care about right opinions, it more reasonable for me
to have power." Yes in the matter about which you do care, in opinions. But in
a matter in which they have cared more than you, give way to them. The case is
just the same as if, because you have right opinions, you thought that in using
the bow you should hit the mark better than an archer, and in working in metal
you should succeed better than a smith. Give up, then, your earnestness about
opinions and employ yourself about the things which you wish to acquire; and
then lament, if you do not succeed; for you deserve to lament. But now you say
that you are occupied with other things, that you are looking after other
things; but the many say this truly, that one act has no community with
another. He who has risen in the morning seeks whom he shall salute, to whom he
shall say something agreeable, to whom he shall send a present, how he shall
please the dancing man, how by bad behavior to one he may please another. When
he prays, he prays about these things; when he sacrifices, he sacrifices for
these things: the saying of Pythagoras
       Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes
he transfers to these things. "Where have I failed in the matters pertaining to
flattery?" "What have I done?" Anything like a free man, anything like a
noble-minded man? And if he finds anything of the kind, he blames and accuses
himself: "Why did you say this? Was it not in your power to lie? Even the
philosophers say that nothing hinders us from telling a lie." But do you, if
indeed you have cared about nothing else except the proper use of appearances,
as soon as you have risen in the morning reflect, "What do I want in order to
be free from passion, and free from perturbation? What am I? Am I a poor body,
a piece of property, a thing of which something is said? I am none of these.
But what am I? I am a rational animal. What then is required of me?" Reflect on
your acts. "Where have I omitted the things which conduce to happiness? What
have I done which is either unfriendly or unsocial? what have I not done as to
these things which I ought to have done?"
    So great, then, being, the difference in desires, actions, wishes, would
you still have the same share with others in those things about which you have
not laboured, and they have laboured? Then are you surprised if they pity you,
and are you vexed? But they are not vexed if you pity them. Why? Because they
are convinced that they have that which is good, and you are not convinced. For
this reason you are not satisfied with your own, but you desire that which they
have: but they are satisfied with their own, and do not desire what you have:
since, if you were really convinced that with respect to what is good, it is
you who are the possessor of it and that they have missed it, you would not
even have thought of what they say about you.

Chapter 7

On freedom from fear

    What makes the tyrant formidable? "The guards," you say, "and their swords,
and the men of the bedchamber and those who exclude them who would enter." Why,
then, if you bring a boy to the tyrant when he is with his guards, is he not
afraid; or is it because the child does not understand these things? If, then,
any man does understand what guards are and that they have swords, and comes to
the tyrant for this very purpose because he wishes to die on account of some
circumstance and seeks to die easily by the hand of another, is he afraid of
the guards? "No, for he wishes for the thing which makes the guards
formidable." If, then, neither any man wishing to die nor to live by all means,
but only as it may be permitted, approaches the tyrant, what hinders him from
approaching the tyrant without fear? "Nothing." If, then, a man has the same
opinion about his property as the man whom I have instanced has about his body;
and also about his children and his wife, and in a word is so affected by some
madness or despair that he cares not whether he possesses them or not, but like
children who are playing, with shells care about the play, but do not trouble
themselves about the shells, so he too has set no value on the materials, but
values the pleasure that he has with them and the occupation, what tyrant is
then formidable to him or what guards or what swords?
    Then through madness is it possible for a man to be so disposed toward
these things, and the Galilaens through habit, and is it possible that no man
can learn from reason and from demonstration that God has made all the things
in the universe and the universe itself completely free from hindrance and
perfect, and the parts of it for the use of the whole? All other animals indeed
are incapable of comprehending the administration of it; but the rational
animal, man, has faculties for the consideration of all these and for
understanding that it is a part, and what kind of a part it is, and that it is
right for the parts to be subordinate to the whole. And besides this being
naturally noble, magnanimous and free, man sees that of the things which
surround him some are free from hindrance and in his power, and the other
things are subject to hindrance and in the power of others; that the things
which are free from hindrance are in the power of the will; and those which are
subject to hinderance are the things which are not in the power of the will.
And, for this reason, if he thinks that his good and his interest be in these
things only which are free from hindrance and in his own power, he will be
free, prosperous, happy, free from harm, magnanimous pious, thankful to God for
all things; in no matter finding fault with any of the things which have not
been put in his power, nor blaming any of them. But if he thinks that his good
and his interest are in externals and in things which are not in the power of
his will, he must of necessity be hindered, be impeded, be a slave to those who
have the power over things which he admires and fears; and he must of necessity
be impious because he thinks that he is harmed by God, and he must be unjust
because he always claims more than belongs to him; and he must of necessity be
abject and mean.
    What hinders a man, who has clearly separated these things, from living
with a light heart and bearing easily the reins, quietly expecting everything
which can happen, and enduring that which has already happened? "Would you have
me to bear poverty?" Come and you will know what poverty is when it has found
one who can act well the part of a poor man. "Would you have me to possess
power?" Let me have power, and also the trouble of it. "Well, banishment?"
Wherever I shall go, there it will be well with me; for here also where I am,
it was not because of the place that it was well with me, but because of my
opinions which I shall carry off with me: for neither can any man deprive me of
them; but my opinions alone are mine and they cannot he taken from me, and I am
satisfied while I have them, wherever I may be and whatever I am doing. "But
now it is time to die." Why do you say "to die"? Make no tragedy show of the
thing, but speak of it as it is: it is now time for the matter to be resolved
into the things out of which it was composed. And what is the formidable thing
here? what is going to perish of the things which are in the universe? what new
thing or wondrous is going to happen? Is it for this reason that a tyrant is
formidable? Is it for this reason that the guards appear to have swords which
are large and sharp? Say this to others; but I have considered about all these
thins; no man has power over me. I have been made free; I know His commands, no
man can now lead me as a slave. I have a proper person to assert my freedom; I
have proper judges. Are you not the master of my body? What, then, is that to
me? Are you not the master of my property? What, then, is that to me? Are you
not the master of my exile or of my chains? Well, from all these things and all
the poor body itself I depart at your bidding, when you please. Make trial of
your power, and you will know how far it reaches.
    Whom then can I still fear? Those who are over the bedchamber? Lest they
should do, what? Shut me out? If they find that I wish to enter, let them shut
me out. "Why, then, do you go to the doors?" Because I think it befits me,
while the play lasts, to join in it. "How, then, are you not shut out?"
Because, unless some one allows me to go in, I do not choose to ,o in, but am
always content with that I which happens; for I think that what God chooses is
better than what I choose. I will attach myself as a minister and follower to
Him; I have the same movements as He has, I have the same desires; in a word, I
have the same will. There is no shutting out for me, but for those who would
force their in. Why, then, do not I force my way in? Because I know that
nothing good is distributed within to those who enter. But when I hear any man
called fortunate because he is honoured by Caesar, I say, "What does he happen
to get?" A province. Does he also obtain an opinion such as he ought? The
office of a Prefect. Does he also obtain the power of using his office well?
Why do I still strive to enter? A man scatters dried figs and nuts: the
children seize them and fight with one another; men do not, for they think them
to be a small matter. But if a man should throw about shells, even the children
do not seize them. Provinces are distributed: let children look to that. Money
is distributed: let children look to that. Praetorships, consulships are
distributed: let children scramble for them, let them be shut out, beaten, kiss
the hands of the giver, of the slaves: but to me these are only dried figs and
nuts. What then? If you fail to get them, while Caesar is scattering them
about, do not be troubled: if a dried fig come into your lap, take it and eat
it; for so far you may value even a fig. But if I shall stoop down and turn
another over, or be turned over by another, and shall flatter those who have
got into chamber, neither is a dried fig worth the trouble, nor anything else
of the things which are not good, which the philosophers have persuaded me not
to think good.
    Show me the swords of the guards. "See how big they are, and how sharp."
What, then, do these big and sharp swords do? "They kill." And what does a
fever do? "Nothing else." And what else a tile? "Nothing else." Would you then
have me to wonder at these things and worship them, and go about as the slave
of all of them? I hope that this will not happen: but when I have once learned
that everything which has come into existence must also go out of it, that the
universe may not stand still nor be impeded, I no longer consider it any
difference whether a fever shall do it, or a tile, or a soldier. But if a man
must make a comparison between these things, I know that the soldier will do it
with less trouble, and quicker. When, then, I neither fear anything which a
tyrant can do to me, nor desire anything which he can give, why do I still look
on with wonder? Why am I still confounded? Why do I fear the guards? Why am I
pleased if he speaks to me in a friendly way, and receives me, and why do I
tell others how he spoke to me? Is he a Socrates, is he a Diogenes that his
praise should be a proof of what I am? Have I been eager to imitate his morals?
But I keep up the play and go to him, and serve him so long as he does not bid
me to do anything foolish or unreasonable. But if he says to me, "Go and bring
Leon of Salamis," I say to him, "Seek another, for I am no longer playing."
"Lead him away." I follow; that is part of the play. "But your head will be
taken off." Does the tyrant's head always remain where it is, and the heads of
you who obey him? "But you will be cast out unburied." If the corpse is I, I
shall be cast out; but if I am different from the corpse, speak more properly
according as the fact is, and do not think of frightening me. These things are
formidable to children and fools. But if any man has once entered a
philosopher's school and knows not what he is, he deserves to be full of fear
and to flatter those whom afterward he used to flatter; if he has not yet
learned that he is not flesh nor bones nor sinews, but he is that which makes
use of these parts of the body and governs them and follows the appearances of
things.
    "Yes, but this talk makes us despise the laws." And what kind of talk makes
men more obedient to the laws who employ such talk? And the things which are in
the power of a fool are not law. And yet see how this talk makes us disposed as
we ought to be even to these men; since it teaches us to claim in opposition to
them none of the things in which they are able to surpass us. This talk teaches
us, as to the body, to give it up, as to property, to give that up also, as to
children, parents, brothers, to retire from these, to give up all; It only
makes an exception of the opinions, which even Zeus has willed to be the select
property of every man. What transgression of the laws is there here, what
folly? Where you are superior and stronger, there I give way to you: on the
other hand, where I am superior, do you yield to me; for I have studied this,
and you have not. It is your study to live in houses with floors formed of
various stones, how your slaves and dependents shall serve you, how you shall
wear fine clothing, have many hunting men, lute players, and tragic actors. Do
I claim any of these? have you made any study of opinions and of your own
rational faculty? Do you know of what parts it is composed, how they are
brought together, how they are connected, what powers it has, and of what kind?
Why then are you vexed, if another, who has made it his study, has the
advantage over you in these things? "But these things are the greatest." And
who hinders you from being employed about these things and looking after them?
And who has a better stock of books, of leisure, of persons to aid you? Only
turn your mind at last to these things, attend, if it be only a short time, to
your own ruling faculty: consider what this is that you possess, and whence it
came, this which uses all others, and tries them, and selects and rejects. But
so long as you employ yourself about externals you will possess them as no man
else does; but you will have this such as you choose to have it, sordid and
neglected.

Chapter 8

Against those who hastily rush into the use of the philosophic dress

    Never praise nor blame a man because of the things which are common, and do
not ascribe to him any skill or want of skill; and thus you will be free from
rashness and from malevolence. "This man bathes very quickly." Does he then do
wrong? Certainly not. But what does he do? He bathes very quickly. Are all
things then done well? By no means: but the acts which proceed from right
opinions are done well; and those which proceed from bad opinions are done ill.
But do you, until you know the opinion from which a man does each thing,
neither praise nor blame the act. But the opinion is not easily discovered from
the external things. "This man is a carpenter." Why? "Because he uses an ax."
What, then, is this to the matter? "This man is a musician because he sings."
And what does that signify? "This man is a philosopher. Because he wears a
cloak and long hair." And what does a juggler wear? For this reason if a man
sees any philosopher acting indecently, immediately he says, "See what the
philosopher is doing"; but he ought because of the man's indecent behavior
rather to say that he is not a philosopher. For if this is the preconceived
notion of a philosopher and what he professes, to wear a cloak and long hair,
men would say well; but if what he professes is this rather, to keep himself
free from faults, why do we not rather, because he does not make good his
professions, take from him the name of philosopher? For so we do in the case of
all other arts. When a man sees another handling an ax badly, he does not say,
"What is the use of the carpenter's art? See how badly carpenters do their
work"; but he says just the contrary, "This man is not a carpenter, for he uses
an ax badly." In the same way if a man hears another singing badly, he does not
say, "See how musicians sing"; but rather, "This man is not a musician." But it
is in the matter of philosophy only that people do this. When they see a man
acting contrary to the profession of a philosopher, they do not take away his
title, but they assume him to be a philosopher, and from his acts deriving the
fact that he is behaving indecently they conclude that there is no use in
philosophy.
    What, then, is the reason of this? Because we attach value to the notion of
a carpenter, and to that of a musician, and to the notion of other artisans in
like manner, but not to that of a philosopher, and we judge from externals only
that it is a thing confused and ill defined. And what other kind of art has a
name from the dress and the hair; and has not theorems and a material and an
end? What, then, is the material of the philosopher? Is it a cloak? No, but
reason. What is his end? is it to wear a cloak? No, but to possess the reason
in a right state. Of what kind are his theorems? Are they those about the way
in which the beard becomes great or the hair long? No, but rather what Zeno
says, to know the elements of reason, what kind of a thing each of them is, and
how they are fitted to one another, and what things are consequent upon them.
Will you not, then, see first if he does what he professes when he acts in an
unbecoming manner, and then blame his study? But now when you yourself are
acting in a sober way, you say in consequence of what he seems to you to be
doing wrong, "Look at the philosopher," as if it were proper to call by the
name of philosopher one who does these things; and further, "This is the
conduct of a philosopher." But you do not say, "Look at the carpenter," when
you know that a carpenter is an adulterer or you see him to be a glutton; nor
do you say, "See the musician." Thus to a certain degree even you perceive the
profession of a philosopher, but you fall away from the notion, and you are
confused through want of care.
    But even the philosophers themselves as they are called pursue the thing by
beginning with things which are common to them and others: as soon as they have
assumed a cloak and grown a beard, they say, "I am a philosopher." But no man
will say, "I am a musician," if he has bought a plectrum and a lute: nor will
he say, "I am a smith," if he has put on a cap and apron. But the dress is
fitted to the art; and they take their name from the art, and not from the
dress. For this reason Euphrates used to say well, "A long time I strove to be
a philosopher without people knowing it; and this," he said, "was useful to me:
for first I knew that when I did anything well, I did not do it for the sake of
the spectators, but for the sake of myself: I ate well for the sake of myself;
I had my countenance well composed and my walk: all for myself and for God.
Then, as I struggled alone, so I alone also was in danger: in no respect
through me, if I did anything base or unbecoming, was philosophy endangered;
nor did I injure the many by doing anything wrong as a philosopher. For this
reason those who did not know my purpose used to wonder how it was that, while
I conversed and lived altogether with all philosophers, I was not a philosopher
myself. And what was the harm for me to be known to be a philosopher by my acts
and not by outward marks?" See how I eat, how I drink, how I sleep, how I bear
and forbear, how I co-operate, how I employ desire, how I employ aversion, how
I maintain the relations, those which are natural or those which are acquired,
how free from confusion, how free from hindrance. Judge of me from this, if you
can. But if you are so deaf and blind that you cannot conceive even Hephaestus
to be a good smith, unless you see the cap on his head, what is the harm in not
being recognized by so foolish a judge?
    So Socrates was not known to be a philosopher by most persons; and they
used to come to him and ask to be introduced to philosophers. Was he vexed then
as we are, and did he say, "And do you not think that I am a philosopher?" No,
but he would take them and introduce them, being satisfied with one thing, with
being a philosopher; and being pleased also with not being thought to be a
philosopher, he was not annoyed: for he thought of his own occupation. What is
the work of an honourable and good man? To have many pupils? By no means. They
will look to this matter who are earnest about it. But was it his business to
examine carefully difficult theorems? Others will look after these matters
also. In what, then, was he, and who was he and whom did he wish to be? He was
in that wherein there was hurt and advantage. "If any man can damage me," he
says, "I am doing nothing: if I am waiting for another man to do me good, I am
nothing. If I anguish for anything, and it does not happen, I am unfortunate."
To such a contest he invited every man, and I do not think that he would have
declined the contest with any one. What do you suppose? was it by proclaiming
and saying, "I am such a man?" Far from it, but by being such a man. For
further, this is the character of a fool and a boaster to say, "I am free from
passions and disturbance: do not be ignorant, my friends, that while you are
uneasy and disturbed about things of no value, I alone am free from all
perturbation." So is it not enough for you to feel no pain, unless you make
this proclamation: "Come together all who are suffering gout, pains in the
head, fever, ye who are lame, blind, and observe that I am sound from every
ailment." This is empty and disagreeable to hear, unless like Aesculapius you
are able to show immediately by what kind of treatment they also shall be
immediately free from disease, and unless you show your own health as an
example.
    For such is the Cynic who is honoured with the sceptre and the diadem of
Zeus, and says, "That you may see, O men, that you seek happiness and
tranquillity not where it is, but where it is not, behold I am sent to you by
God as an example. I who have neither property nor house, nor wife nor
children, nor even a bed, nor coat nor household utensil; and see how healthy I
am: try me, and if you see that I am free from perturbations, hear the remedies
and how I have been cured." This is both philanthropic and noble. But see whose
work it is, the work of Zeus, or of him whom He may judge worthy of this
service, that he may never exhibit anything to the many, by which he shall make
of no effect his own testimony, whereby he gives testimony to virtue, and bears
evidence against external things:
       His beauteous face pales his cheeks
       He wipes a tear.
    And not this only, but he neither desires nor seeks anything, nor man nor
place nor amusement, as children seek the vintage or holidays; always fortified
by modesty as others are fortified by walls and doors and doorkeepers.
    But now, being only moved to philosophy, as those who have a bad stomach
are moved to some kinds of food which they soon loathe, straightway toward the
sceptre and to the royal power. They let the hair grow, they assume the cloak,
they show the shoulder bare, they quarrel with those whom they meet; and if
they see a man in a thick winter coat, they quarrel with him. Man, first
exercise yourself in winter weather: see your movements that they are not those
of a man with a bad stomach or those of a longing woman. First strive that it
be not known what you are: be a philosopher to yourself a short time. Fruit
grows thus: the seed must be buried for some time, hid, grow slowly in order
that it may come to perfection. But if it produces the ear before the jointed
stem, it is imperfect, a produce of the garden of Adonis. Such a poor plant are
you also: you have blossomed too soon; the cold weather will scorch you up. See
what the husbandmen say about seeds when there is warm weather too early. They
are afraid lest the seeds should be too luxuriant, and then a single frost
should lay hold of them and show that they are too forward. Do you also
consider, my man: you have shot out too soon, you have hurried toward a little
fame before the proper season: you think that you are something, a fool among
fools: you will be caught by the frost, and rather you have been frost-bitten
in the root below, but your upper parts still blossom a little, and for this
reason you think that you are still alive and flourishing. Allow us to ripen in
the natural way: why do you bare us? why do you force us? we are not yet able
to bear the air. Let the root grow, then acquire the first joint, then the
second, and then the third: in this way, then, the fruit will naturally force
itself out, even if I do not choose. For who that is pregnant and I filled with
such great principles does not also perceive his own powers and move toward the
corresponding acts? A bull is not ignorant of his own nature and his powers,
when a wild beast shows itself, nor does he wait for one to urge him on; nor a
dog when he sees a wild animal. But if I have the powers of a good man, shall I
wait for you to prepare me for my own acts? At present I have them not, believe
me. Why then do you wish me to be withered up before the time, as you have been
withered up?

Chapter 9

To a person who had been changed to a character of shamelessness

    When you see another man in the possession of power, set against this the
fact that you have not the want of power; when you see another rich, see what
you possess in place of riches: for if you possess nothing in place of them,
you are miserable; but if you have not the want of riches, know that you
possess more than this man possesses and what is worth much more. Another man
possesses a handsome woman: you have the satisfaction of not desiring a
handsome wife. Do these things appear to you to he small? And how much would
these persons give, these very men who are rich and in possession of power, and
live with handsome women, to be able to despise riches and power and these very
women whom they love and enjoy? Do you not know, then, what is the thirst of a
man who has a fever? He possesses that which is in no degree like the thirst of
a man who is in health: for the man who is in health ceases to be thirsty after
he has drunk; but the sick man, being pleased for a short time, has a nausea;
he converts the drink into bile, vomits, is griped, and more thirsty. It is
such a thing to have desire of riches and to possess riches, desire of power
and to possess power, desire of a beautiful woman and to sleep with her: to
this is added jealousy, fear of being deprived of the thing which you love,
indecent words, indecent thoughts, unseemly acts.
    "And what do I lose?" you will say. My man, you were modest, and you are so
no longer. Have you lost nothing? In place of Chrysippus and Zeno you read
Aristides and Evenus; have you lost nothing? In place of Socrates and Diogenes,
you admire him who is able to corrupt and seduce most women. You wish to appear
handsome and try to make yourself so, though you are not. You like to display
splendid clothes that you may attract women; and if you find any fine oil, yon
imagine that you are happy. But formerly you did not think of any such thing,
but only where there should be decent talk, a worthy man, and a generous
conception. Therefore you slept like a man, walked forth like a man, wore a
manly dress, and used to talk in a way becoming a good man; then do you say to
me, "I have lost nothing?" So do men lose nothing more than coin? Is not
modesty lost? Is not decent behavior lost? is it that he who has lost these
things has sustained no loss? Perhaps you think that not one of these things is
a loss. But there was a time when you reckoned this the only loss and damage,
and you were anxious that no man should disturb you from these words and
actions.
    Observe, you are disturbed from these good words and actions by nobody but
by yourself. Fight with yourself, restore yourself to decency, to modesty, to
liberty. If any man ever told you this about me, that a person forces me to be
an adulterer, to wear such a dress as yours, to perfume myself with oils, would
you not have gone and with your own hand have killed the man who thus
calumniated me? Now will you not help yourself? and how much easier is this
help? There is no need to kill any man, nor to put him in chains, nor to treat
him with contumely, nor to enter the Forum, but it is only necessary for you to
speak to yourself who will be the most easily persuaded, with whom no man has
more power of persuasion than yourself. First of all, condemn what you are
doing, and then, when you have condemned it, do not despair of yourself, and be
not in the condition of those men of mean spirit, who, when they have once
given in, surrender themselves completely and are carried away as if by a
torrent. But see what the trainers of boys do. Has the boy fallen? "Rise," they
say, "wrestle again till you are made strong." Do you also do something of the
same kind: for be well assured that nothing is more tractable than the human
soul. You must exercise the will, and the thing is done, it is set right: as on
the other hand, only fall a-nodding, and the thing is lost: for from within
comes ruin and from within comes help. "Then what good do I gain?" And what
greater good do you seek than this? From a shameless man you will become a
modest man, from a disorderly you will become an orderly man, from a faithless
you will become a faithful man, from a man of unbridled habits a sober man. If
you seek anything more than this, go on doing what you are doing: not even a
God can now help you.

Chapter 10

What things we ought to despise, and what things we ought to value

    The difficulties of all men are about external things, their helplessness
is about externals. "What shall I do, how will it be, how will it turn out,
will this happen, will that?" All these are the words of those who are turning
themselves to things which are not within the power of the will. For who says,
"How shall I not assent to that which is false? how shall I not turn away from
the truth?" If a man be of such a good disposition as to be anxious about these
things, I will remind him of this: "Why are you anxious? The thing is in your
own power: be assured: do not be precipitate in assenting before you apply the
natural rule." On the other side, if a man is anxious about desire, lest it
fail in its purpose and miss its end, and with respect to the avoidance of
things, lest he should fall into that which he would avoid, I will first kiss
him, because he throws away the things about which others are in a flutter, and
their fears, and employs his thoughts about his own affairs and his own
condition. Then I shall say to him: "If you do not choose to desire that which
you will fall to obtain nor to attempt to avoid that into which you will fall,
desire nothing which belongs to others, nor try to avoid any of the things
which are not in your power. If you do not observe this rule, you must of
necessity fall in your desires and fall into that which you would avoid. What
is the difficulty here? where is there room for the words, 'How will it be?'
and 'How will it turn out?' and, 'Will this happen or that?'
    Now is not that which will happen independent of the will? "Yes." And the
nature of good and of evil, is it not in the things which are within the power
of the will? "Yes." Is it in your power, then, to treat according to nature
everything which happens? Can any person hinder you? "No man." No longer then
say to me, "How will it be?" For however it may be, you will dispose of it
well, and the result to you will be a fortunate one. What would Hercules have
been if he had said, "How shall a great lion not appear to me, or a great boar,
or savage men?" And what do you care for that? If a great boar appear, you will
fight a greater fight: if bad men appear, you relieve the earth of the bad.
"Suppose, then, that I may lose my life in this way." You will die a good man,
doing a noble act. For since we must certainly die, of necessity a man must be
found doing something, either following the employment of a husbandman, or
digging, or trading, or serving in a consulship or suffering from indigestion
or from diarrhea. What then do you wish to be doing, when you are found by
death? I for my part would wish to be found doing something which belongs to a
man, beneficent, suitable to the general interest, noble. But if I cannot be
found doing things so great, I would be found doing at least that which I
cannot be hindered from doing, that which is permitted me to do, correcting,
myself, cultivating the faculty which makes use of appearances, labouring at
freedom from the affects, rendering to the relations of life their due; if I
succeed so far, also touching on the third topic, safety in the forming
judgements about things. If death surprises me when I am busy about these
things, it is enough for me if I can stretch out my hands to God and say:
    "The means which I have received from Thee for seeing Thy administration
and following it, I have not neglected: I have not dishonoured Thee by my acts:
see how I have used my perceptions, see how I have used my preconceptions: have
I ever blamed Thee? have I been discontented with anything that happens, or
wished it to be otherwise? have I wished to transgress the relations? That Thou
hast given me life, I thank Thee for what Thou has given me: so long as I have
used the things which are Thine, I am content; take them back and place them
wherever Thou mayest choose; for Thine were all things, Thou gavest them to
me." Is it not enough to depart in this state of mind, and what life is better
and more becoming than that of a man who is in this state of mind? and what end
is more happy?
    But that this may be done, a man must receive no small things, nor are the
things small which he must lose. You cannot both wish to be a consul and to
have these things, and to be eager to have lands and these things also; and to
be solicitous about slaves and about yourself. But if you wish for anything
which belongs to another, that which is your own is lost. This is the nature of
the thing: nothing is given or had for nothing. And where is the wonder? If you
wish to be a consul, you must keep awake, run about, kiss hands, waste yourself
with exhaustion at other men's doors, say and do many things unworthy of a free
man, send gifts to many, daily presents to some. And what is the thing that is
got? Twelve bundles of rods, to sit three or four times on the tribunal, to
exhibit the games in the Circus and to give suppers in small baskets. Or, if
you do not agree about this, let some one show me what there is besides these
things. In order, then, to secure freedom from passions, tranquillity, to sleep
well when you do sleep, to be really awake when you are awake, to fear nothing,
to be anxious about nothing, will you spend nothing and give no labour? But if
anything belonging to you be lost while you are thus busied, or be wasted
badly, or another obtains what you ought to have obtained, will you immediately
be vexed at what has happened? Will you not take into the account on the other
side what you receive and for what, how much for how much? Do you expect to
have for nothing things so great? And how can you? One work has no community
with another. You cannot have both external things after bestowing care on them
and your own ruling faculty: but if you would have those, give up this. If you
do not, you will have neither this nor that, while you are drawn in different
ways to both. The oil will be spilled, the household vessels will perish: but I
shall be free from passions. There will be a fire when I am not present, and
the books will be destroyed: but I shall treat appearances according to nature.
"Well; but I shall have nothing to eat." If I am so unlucky, death is a
harbour; and death is the harbour for all; this is the place of refuge; and for
this reason not one of the things in life is difficult: as soon as you choose,
you are out of the house, and are smoked no more. Why, then, are you anxious,
why do you lose your sleep, why do you not straightway, after considering
wherein your good is and your evil, say, "Both of them are in my power? Neither
can any man deprive me of the good, nor involve me in the bad against my will.
Why do I not throw myself down and snore? for all that I have is safe. As to
the things which belong to others, he will look to them who gets them, as they
may be given by Him who has the power. Who am I who wish to have them in this
way or in that? is a power ofselecting them given to me? has any person made me
the dispenser of them? Those things are enough for me over which I have power:
I ought to manage them as well as I can: and all the rest, as the Master of
them may choose."
    When a man has these things before his eyes, does he keep awake and turn
hither and thither? What would he have, or what does he regret, Patroclus or
Antilochus or Menelaus? For when did he suppose that any of his friends was
immortal, and when had he not before his eyes that on the morrow or the day
after he or his friend must die? "Yes," he says, "but I thought that he would
survive me and bring up my son." You were a fool for that reason, and you were
thinking of what was uncertain. Why, then, do you not blame yourself, and sit
crying like girls? "But he used to set my food before me." Because he was
alive, you fool, but now he cannot: but Automedon will set it before you, and
if Automedon also dies, you will find another. But if the pot, in which your
meat was cooked, should be broken, must you die of hunger, because you have not
the pot which you are accustomed to? Do you not send and buy a new pot? He
says:
       "No greater ill could fall on me."
Why is this your ill? Do you, then, instead of removing it, blame your mother
for not foretelling it to you that you might continue grieving from that time?
What do you think? do you not suppose that Homer wrote this that we may learn
that those of noblest birth, the strongest and the richest, the most handsome,
when they have not the opinions which they ought to have, are not prevented
from being most wretched and unfortunate?

Chapter 11

About Purity

    Some persons raise a question whether the social feeling is contained in
the nature of man; and yet I think that these same persons would have no doubt
that love of purity is certainly contained in it, and that, if man is
distinguished from other animals by anything, he is distinguished by this.
When, then, we see any other animal cleaning itself, we are accustomed to speak
of the act with surprise, and to add that the animal is acting like a man: and,
on the other hand, if a man blames an animal for being dirty, straightway as if
we were making an excuse for it, we say that of course the animal is not a
human creature. So we suppose that there is something superior in man, and that
we first receive it from the Gods. For since the Gods by their nature are pure
and free from corruption, so far as men approach them by reason, so far do they
cling to purity and to a love of purity. But since it is impossible that man's
nature can be altogether pure being mixed of such materials, reason is applied,
as far as it is possible, and reason endeavours to make human nature love
    The first, then, and highest purity is that which is in the soul; and we
say the same of impurity. Now you could not discover the impurity of the soul
as you could discover that of the body: but as to the soul, what else could you
find in it than that which makes it filthy in respect to the acts which are her
own? Now the acts of the soul are movement toward an object or movement from
it, desire, aversion, preparation, design, assent. What, then, is it which in
these acts makes the soul filthy and impure? Nothing else than her own bad
judgements. Consequently, the impurity of the soul is the soul's bad opinions;
and the purification of the soul is the planting in it of proper opinions; and
the soul is pure which has proper opinions, for the soul alone in her own acts
is free from perturbation and pollution.
    Now we ought to work at something like this in the body also, as far as we
can. It was impossible for the defluxions of the nose not to run when man has
such a mixture in his body. For this reason, nature has made hands and the
nostrils themselves as channels for carrying off the humours. If, then, a man
sucks up the defluxions, I say that he is not doing the act of a man. It was
impossible for a man's feet not to be made muddy and not be soiled at all when
he passes through dirty places. For this reason, nature has made water and
hands. It was impossible that some impurity should not remain in the teeth from
eating: for this reason, she says, wash the teeth. Why? In order that you may
be a man and not a wild beast or a hog. It was impossible that from the sweat
and the pressing of the clothes there should not remain some impurity about the
body which requires to be cleaned away. For this reason water, oil, hands,
towels, scrapers, nitre, sometimes all other kinds of means are necessary for
cleaning the body. You do not act so: but the smith will take off the rust from
the iron, and be will have tools prepared for this purpose, and you yourself
wash the platter when you are going to eat, if you are not completely impure
and dirty: but will you not wash the body nor make it clean? "Why?" he replies.
I will tell you again; in the first place, that you may do the acts of a man;
then, that you may not be disagreeable to those with whom you associate. You do
something of this kind even in this matter, and you do not perceive it: you
think that you deserve to stink. Let it be so: deserve to stink. Do you think
that also those who sit by you, those who recline at table with you, that those
who kiss you deserve the same? Either go into a desert, where you deserve to
go, or live by yourself, and smell yourself. For it is just that you alone
should enjoy your own impurity. But when you are in a city, to behave so
inconsiderately and foolishly, to what character do you think that it belongs?
If nature had entrusted to you a horse, would you have overlooked and neglected
him? And now think that you have been intrusted with your own body as with a
horse; wash it, wipe it, take care that no man turns away from it, that no one
gets out of the way for it. But who does not get out of the way of a dirty man,
of a stinking man, of a man whose skin is foul, more than he does out of the
way of a man who is daubed with muck? That smell is from without, it is put
upon him; but the other smell is from want of care, from within, and in a
manner from a body in putrefaction.
    "But Socrates washed himself seldom." Yes, but his body was clean and fair:
and it was so agreeable and sweet that tile most beautiful and the most noble
loved him, and desired to sit by him rather than by the side of those who had
the handsomest forms. It was in his power neither to use the bath nor to wash
himself, if he chose; and yet the rare use of water had an effect. If you do
not choose to wash with warm water, wash with cold. But Aristophanes says:
       Those who are pale, unshod, 'tis those I mean.
For Aristophanes says of Socrates that he also walked the air and stole clothes
from the palaestra. But all who have written about Socrates bear exactly the
contrary evidence in his favour; they say that he was pleasant not only to
hear, but also to see. On the other hand they write the same about Diogenes.
For we ought not even by the appearance of the body to deter the multitude from
philosophy; but as in other things, a philosopher should show himself cheerful
and tranquil, so also he should in the things that relate to the body: "See, ye
men, that I have nothing, that I want nothing: see how I am without a house,
and without a city, and an exile, if it happens to be so, and without a hearth
I live more free from trouble and more happily than all of noble birth and than
the rich. But look at my poor body also and observe that it is not injured by
my hard way of living." But if a man says this to me, who has the appearance
and face of a condemned man, what God shall persuade me to approach philosophy,
if it makes men such persons? Far from it; I would not choose to do so, even if
I were going to become a wise man. I indeed would rather that a young man, who
is making his first movements toward philosophy, should come to me with his
hair carefully trimmed than with it dirty and rough, for there is seen in him a
certain notion of beauty and a desire of that which is becoming; and where he
supposes it to be, there also he strives that it shall be. It is only necessary
to show him, and to say: "Young man, you seek beauty, and you do well: you must
know then that it grows in that part of you where you have the rational
faculty: seek it there where you have the movements toward and the movements
from things, where you have the desire toward, ind the aversion from things:
for this is what you have in yourself of a superior kind; but the poor body is
naturally only earth: why do you labour about it to no purpose? if you shall
learn nothing else, you will learn from time that the body is nothing." But if
a man comes to me daubed with filth, dirty, with a mustache down to his knees,
what can I say to him, by what kind of resemblance can I lead him on? For about
what has he busied himself which resembles beauty, that I may be able to change
him and "Beauty is not in this, but in that?" Would you have me to tell him,
that beauty consists not in being daubed with muck, but that it lies in the
rational part? Has he any desire of beauty? has he any form of it in his mind?
Go and talk to a hog, and tell him not to roll in the mud.
    For this reason the words of Xenocrates touched Polemon also; since he was
a lover of beauty, for he entered, having in him certain incitements to love of
beauty, but he looked for it in the wrong place. For nature has not made even
the animals dirty which live with man. Does a horse ever wallow in the mud or a
well-bred dog? But the hog, and the dirty geese, and worms and spiders do,
which are banished furthest from human intercourse. Do you, then, being a man,
choose to be not as one of the animals which live with man, but rather a worm,
or a spider? Will you not wash yourself somewhere some time in such manner as
you choose? Will you not wash off the dirt from your body? Will you not come
clean that those with whom you keep company may have pleasure in being with
you? But do you go with us even into the temples in such a state, where it is
not permitted to spit or blow the nose, being a heap of spittle and of snot?
    When then? does any man require you to ornament yourself? Far from it;
except to ornament that which we really are by nature, the rational faculty,
the opinions, the actions; but as to the body only so far as purity, only so
far as not to give offense. But if you are told that you ought not to wear
garments dyed with purple, go and daub your cloak with muck or tear it. "But
how shall I have a neat cloak?" Man, you have water; wash it. Here is a youth
worthy of being loved, here is an old man worthy of loving and being loved in
return, a fit person for a man to intrust to him a son's instruction, to whom
daughters and young men shall come, if opportunity shall so happen, that the
teacher shall deliver his lessons to them on a dunghill. Let this not be so:
every deviation comes from something which is in man's nature; but this is near
being something not in man's nature.

Chapter 12

On attention

    When you have remitted your attention for a short time, do not imagine
this, that you will recover it when you choose; but let but let this thought be
present to you, that in consequence of the fault committed to-day your affairs
must be in a worse condition for all that follows. For first, and what causes
most trouble, a habit of not attending is formed in you; then a habit of
deferring your attention. And continually from time to time you drive away, by
deferring it, the happiness of life, proper behavior, the being and living
conformably to nature. If, then, the procrastination of attention is
profitable, the complete omission of attention is more profitable; but if it is
not profitable, why do you not maintain your attention constant? "To-day I
choose to play." Well then, ought you not to play with attention? "I choose to
sing." What, then, hinders you from doing so with attention? Is there any part
of life excepted, to which attention does not extend? For will you do it worse
by using attention, and better by not attending at all? And what else of things
in life is done better by those who do not use attention? Does he who works in
wood work better by not attending to it? Does the captain of a ship manage it
better by not attending? and is any of the smaller acts done better by
inattention? Do you not see that, when you have let your mind loose, it is no
longer in your power to recall it, either to propriety, or to modesty, or to
moderation: but you do everything that comes into your mind in obedience to
your inclinations?
    To what things then ought I to attend? First to those general (principles)
and to have them in readiness, and without them not to sleep, not to rise, not
to drink, not to eat, not to converse with men; that no man is master of
another man's will, but that in the will alone is the good and the bad. No man,
then, has the power either to procure for me any good or to involve me in any
evil, but I alone myself over myself have power in these things. When, then,
these things are secured to me, why need I be disturbed about external things?
What tyrant is formidable, what disease, what poverty, what offense? "Well, I
have not pleased a certain person." Is he then my work, my judgement? "No." Why
then should I trouble myself about him? "But he is supposed to be some one." He
will look to that himself; and those who think so will also. But I have One
Whom I ought to please, to Whom I ought to subject myself, Whom I ought to
obey, God and those who are next to Him. He has placed me with myself, and has
put my will in obedience to myself alone, and has given me rules for the right
use of it; and when I follow these rules in syllogisms, I do not care for any
man who says anything else: in sophistical argument, I care for no man. Why
then in greater matters do those annoy me who blame me? What is the cause of
this perturbation? Nothing else than because in this matter I am not
disciplined. For all knowledge despises ignorance and the ignorant; and not
only the sciences, but even the arts. Produce any shoemaker that you please,
and he ridicules the many in respect to his own work. Produce any carpenter.
    First, then, we ought to have these in readiness, and to do nothing without
them, and we ought to keep the soul directed to this mark, to pursue nothing
external, and nothing which belongs to others, but to do as He has appointed
Who has the power; we ought to pursue altogether the things which are in the
power of the will, and all other things as it is permitted. Next to this we
ought to remember who we are, and what is our name, and to endeavour to direct
our duties toward the character of our several relations in this manner: what
is the season for singing, what is the season for play, and in whose presence;
what will be the consequence of the act; whether our associates will despise
us, whether we shall despise them; when to jeer, and whom to ridicule; and on
what occasion to comply and with whom; and finally, in complying how to
maintain our own character. But wherever you have deviated from any of these
rules, there is damage immediately, not from anything external, but from the
action itself.
    What then? is it possible to be free from faults? It is not possible; but
tills is possible, to direct your efforts incessantly to being faultless. For
we must be content if by never remitting this attention we shall escape at
least a few errors. But now when you have said, "To-morrow I will begin to
attend," you must be told that you are saying this, "To-day I will be
shameless, disregardful of time and place, mean; it will be in the power of
others to give me pain; to-day I will be passionate and envious." See how many
evil things you are permitting yourself to do. If it is good to use attention
to-morrow, how much better is it to do so to-day? if to-morrow it is in your
interest to attend, much more is it to-day, that you may be able to do so
to-morrow also, and may not defer it again to the third day.

Chapter 13

Against or to those who readily tell their own affairs

    When a man has seemed to us to have talked with simplicity about his own
affairs, how is it that at last we are ourselves also induced to discover to
him our own secrets and we think this to be candid behavior? In the first
place, because it seems unfair for a man to have listened to the affairs of his
neighbour, and not to communicate to him also in turn our own affairs: next,
because we think that we shall not present to them the appearance of candid men
when we are silent about our own affairs. Indeed men are often accustomed to
say, "I have told you all my affairs, will you tell me nothing of your own?
where is this done?" Besides, we have also this opinion that we can safely
trust him who has already told us his own affairs; for the notion rises in our
mind that this man could never divulge our affairs because he would be cautious
that we also should not divulge his. In this way also the incautious are caught
by the soldiers at Rome. A soldier sits by you in a common dress and begins to
speak ill of Caesar; then you, as if you had received a pledge of his fidelity
by his having begun the abuse, utter yourself also what you think, and then you
are carried off in chains.
    Something of this kind happens to us generally. Now as this man has
confidently intrusted his affairs to me, shall I also do so to any man whom I
meet? For when I have heard, I keep silence, if I am of such a disposition; but
he goes forth and tells all men what he has heard. Then if I hear what has been
done, if I be a man like him, I resolve to be revenged, I divulge what he has
told me; I both disturb others and am disturbed myself. But if I remember that
one man does not injure another, and that every man's acts injure and profit
him, I secure this, that I do not anything like him, but still I suffer what I
do suffer through my own silly talk.
    "True: but it is unfair when you have heard the secrets of your neighbour
for you in turn to communicate nothing to him." Did I ask you for your secrets,
my man? did you communicate your affairs on certain terms, that you should in
return hear mine also? If you are a babbler and think that all who meet you are
friends, do you wish me also to be like you? But why, if you did well in
entrusting your affairs to me, and it is not well for me to intrust mine to
you, do you wish me to be so rash? It is just the same as if I had a cask which
is water-tight, and you one with a hole in it, and you should come and deposit
with me your wine that I might put it into my cask, and then should complain
that I also did not intrust my wine to you, for you have a cask with a hole in
it. How then is there any equality here? You intrusted your affairs to a man
who is faithful and modest, to a man who thinks that his own actions alone are
injurious and useful, and that nothing external is. Would you have me intrust
mine to you, a man who has dishonoured his own faculty of will, and who wishes
to gain some small bit of money or some office or promotion in the court, even
if you should be going to murder your own children, like Medea? Where is this
equality? But show yourself to me to be faithful, modest, and steady: show me
that you have friendly opinions; show that your cask has no hole in it; and you
will see how I shall not wait for you to trust me with your affairs, but I
myself shall come to you and ask you to hear mine. For who does not choose to
make use of a good vessel? Who does not value a benevolent and faithful
adviser? who will not willingly receive a man who is ready to bear a share, as
we may say, of the difficulty of his circumstances, and by this very act to
ease the burden, by taking a part of it.
    "True: but I trust you; you do not trust me." In the first place, not even
do you trust me, but you are a babbler, and for this reason you cannot hold
anything; for indeed, if it is true that you trust me, trust your affairs to me
only; but now, whenever you see a man at leisure, you seat yourself by him and
say: "Brother, I have no friend more benevolent than you nor dearer; I request
you to listen to my affairs." And you do this even to those who are not known
to you at all. But if you really trust me, it is plain that you trust me
because I am faithful and modest, not because I have told my affairs to you.
Allow me, then, to have the same opinion about you. Show me that, if one man
tells his affairs to another, he who tells them is faithful and modest. For if
this were so, I would go about and tell my affairs to every man, if that would
make me faithful and modest. But the thing is not so, and it requires no common
opinions. If, then, you see a man who is busy about things not dependent on his
will and subjecting his will to them, you must know that this man has ten
thousand persons to compel and hinder him. He has no need of pitch or the wheel
to compel him to declare what he knows: but a little girl's nod, if it should
so happen, will move him, the blandishment of one who belongs to Caesar's
court, desire of a magistracy or of an inheritance, and things without end of
that sort. You must remember, then, among general principles that secret
discourses require fidelity and corresponding opinions. But where can we now
find these easily? Or if you cannot answer that question, let some one point
out to me a man who can say: "I care only about the things which are my own,
the things which are not subject to hindrance, the things which are by nature
free." This I hold to be the nature of the good: but let all other things be as
they are allowed; I do not concern myself.

The Enchiridion
By Epictetus


Translated by Elizabeth Carter

1. Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control
are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are
our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation,
command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.

The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered;
but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging
to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are
slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is
your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be
disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if
you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs
to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or
restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no
one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you,
you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed. 

Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not
allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards
the attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some
things and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both
have these great things, along with power and riches, then you will
not gain even the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you
will absolutely fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom
are achieved. 

Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, "You
are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to
be." And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first,
and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are in
our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything
not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.

2. Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that
of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that
to which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object
of his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his
aversion wretched. If, then, you confine your aversion to those objects
only which are contrary to the natural use of your faculties, which
you have in your own control, you will never incur anything to which
you are averse. But if you are averse to sickness, or death, or poverty,
you will be wretched. Remove aversion, then, from all things that
are not in our control, and transfer it to things contrary to the
nature of what is in our control. But, for the present, totally suppress
desire: for, if you desire any of the things which are not in your
own control, you must necessarily be disappointed; and of those which
are, and which it would be laudable to desire, nothing is yet in your
possession. Use only the appropriate actions of pursuit and avoidance;
and even these lightly, and with gentleness and reservation.

3. With regard to whatever objects give you delight, are useful, or
are deeply loved, remember to tell yourself of what general nature
they are, beginning from the most insignificant things. If, for example,
you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is
only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks,
you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say
that you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be
disturbed if either of them dies. 

4. When you are going about any action, remind yourself what nature
the action is. If you are going to bathe, picture to yourself the
things which usually happen in the bath: some people splash the water,
some push, some use abusive language, and others steal. Thus you will
more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, "I will now
go bathe, and keep my own mind in a state conformable to nature."
And in the same manner with regard to every other action. For thus,
if any hindrance arises in bathing, you will have it ready to say,
"It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my mind in a
state conformable to nature; and I will not keep it if I am bothered
at things that happen. 

5. Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions
which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible,
else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists
in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are
hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others,
but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed
person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone
just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who
is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on
himself. 

6. Don't be prideful with any excellence that is not your own. If
a horse should be prideful and say, " I am handsome," it would be
supportable. But when you are prideful, and say, " I have a handsome
horse," know that you are proud of what is, in fact, only the good
of the horse. What, then, is your own? Only your reaction to the appearances
of things. Thus, when you behave conformably to nature in reaction
to how things appear, you will be proud with reason; for you will
take pride in some good of your own. 

7. Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if you go on
shore to get water you may along the way amuse yourself with picking
up a shellish, or an onion. However, your thoughts and continual attention
ought to be bent towards the ship, waiting for the captain to call
on board; you must then immediately leave all these things, otherwise
you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck and feet like a sheep.
So it is with life. If, instead of an onion or a shellfish, you are
given a wife or child, that is fine. But if the captain calls, you
must run to the ship, leaving them, and regarding none of them. But
if you are old, never go far from the ship: lest, when you are called,
you should be unable to come in time. 

8. Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they
happen as they do happen, and you will go on well. 

9. Sickness is a hindrance to the body, but not to your ability to
choose, unless that is your choice. Lameness is a hindrance to the
leg, but not to your ability to choose. Say this to yourself with
regard to everything that happens, then you will see such obstacles
as hindrances to something else, but not to yourself. 

10. With every accident, ask yourself what abilities you have for
making a proper use of it. If you see an attractive person, you will
find that self-restraint is the ability you have against your desire.
If you are in pain, you will find fortitude. If you hear unpleasant
language, you will find patience. And thus habituated, the appearances
of things will not hurry you away along with them. 

11. Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have returned
it." Is your child dead? It is returned. Is your wife dead? She is
returned. Is your estate taken away? Well, and is not that likewise
returned? "But he who took it away is a bad man." What difference
is it to you who the giver assigns to take it back? While he gives
it to you to possess, take care of it; but don't view it as your own,
just as travelers view a hotel. 

12. If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: "If I
neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant,
he will be bad." For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from
grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it
is better your servant should be bad, than you unhappy. 

Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little
wine stolen? Say to yourself, "This is the price paid for apathy,
for tranquillity, and nothing is to be had for nothing." When you
call your servant, it is possible that he may not come; or, if he
does, he may not do what you want. But he is by no means of such importance
that it should be in his power to give you any disturbance.

13. If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid
with regard to external things. Don't wish to be thought to know anything;
and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, distrust
yourself. For, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice
in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external
things. But while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity
neglect the other. 

14. If you wish your children, and your wife, and your friends to
live for ever, you are stupid; for you wish to be in control of things
which you cannot, you wish for things that belong to others to be
your own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be without fault,
you are a fool; for you wish vice not to be vice," but something else.
But, if you wish to have your desires undisappointed, this is in your
own control. Exercise, therefore, what is in your control. He is the
master of every other person who is able to confer or remove whatever
that person wishes either to have or to avoid. Whoever, then, would
be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends
on others else he must necessarily be a slave. 

15. Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner party. Is
anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your share
with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don't stop it. Is it not yet
come? Don't stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches
you. Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts,
to riches, and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts
of the gods. And if you don't even take the things which are set before
you, but are able even to reject them, then you will not only be a
partner at the feasts of the gods, but also of their empire. For,
by doing this, Diogenes, Heraclitus and others like them, deservedly
became, and were called, divine. 

16. When you see anyone weeping in grief because his son has gone
abroad, or is dead, or because he has suffered in his affairs, be
careful that the appearance may not misdirect you. Instead, distinguish
within your own mind, and be prepared to say, "It's not the accident
that distresses this person., because it doesn't distress another
person; it is the judgment which he makes about it." As far as words
go, however, don't reduce yourself to his level, and certainly do
not moan with him. Do not moan inwardly either. 

17. Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of such a kind as the
author pleases to make it. If short, of a short one; if long, of a
long one. If it is his pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple,
a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For
this is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to
choose it is another's. 

18. When a raven happens to croak unluckily, don't allow the appearance
hurry you away with it, but immediately make the distinction to yourself,
and say, "None of these things are foretold to me; but either to my
paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But
to me all omens are lucky, if I will. For whichever of these things
happens, it is in my control to derive advantage from it."

19. You may be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat in which
it is not in your own control to conquer. When, therefore, you see
anyone eminent in honors, or power, or in high esteem on any other
account, take heed not to be hurried away with the appearance, and
to pronounce him happy; for, if the essence of good consists in things
in our own control, there will be no room for envy or emulation. But,
for your part, don't wish to be a general, or a senator, or a consul,
but to be free; and the only way to this is a contempt of things not
in our own control. 

20. Remember, that not he who gives ill language or a blow insults,
but the principle which represents these things as insulting. When,
therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion
which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be
hurried away with the appearance. For if you once gain time and respite,
you will more easily command yourself. 

21. Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible
be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you win never entertain
any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything. 

22. If you have an earnest desire of attaining to philosophy, prepare
yourself from the very first to be laughed at, to be sneered by the
multitude, to hear them say,." He is returned to us a philosopher
all at once," and " Whence this supercilious look?" Now, for your
part, don't have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to
those things which appear best to you as one appointed by God to this
station. For remember that, if you adhere to the same point, those
very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But
if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule.

23. If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, so as
to wish to please anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme
of life. Be contented, then, in everything with being a philosopher;
and, if you wish to be thought so likewise by anyone, appear so to
yourself, and it will suffice you. 

24. Don't allow such considerations as these distress you. "I will
live in dishonor, and be nobody anywhere." For, if dishonor is an
evil, you can no more be involved in any evil by the means of another,
than be engaged in anything base. Is it any business of yours, then,
to get power, or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means.
How, then, after all, is this a dishonor? And how is it true that
you will be nobody anywhere, when you ought to be somebody in those
things only which are in your own control, in which you may be of
the greatest consequence? "But my friends will be unassisted." --
What do you mean by unassisted? They will not have money from you,
nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who told you, then, that these
are among the things in our own control, and not the affair of others?
And who can give to another the things which he has not himself? "Well,
but get them, then, that we too may have a share." If I can get them
with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and greatness of
mind, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require me to
lose my own proper good that you may gain what is not good, consider
how inequitable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather
have, a sum of money, or a friend of fidelity and honor? Rather assist
me, then, to gain this character than require me to do those things
by which I may lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends
on me, will be unassisted. Here again, what assistance is this you
mean? "It will not have porticoes nor baths of your providing." And
what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with shoes,
or a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if everyone fully performs
his own proper business. And were you to supply it with another citizen
of honor and fidelity, would not he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore
neither are you yourself useless to it. "What place, then, say you,
will I hold in the state?" Whatever you can hold with the preservation
of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring to be useful to that,
you lose these, of what use can you be to your country when you are
become faithless and void of shame. 

25. Is anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, or in a compliment,
or in being admitted to a consultation? If these things are good,
you ought to be glad that he has gotten them; and if they are evil,
don't be grieved that you have not gotten them. And remember that
you cannot, without using the same means [which others do] to acquire
things not in our own control, expect to be thought worthy of an equal
share of them. For how can he who does not frequent the door of any
[great] man, does not attend him, does not praise him, have an equal
share with him who does? You are unjust, then, and insatiable, if
you are unwilling to pay the price for which these things are sold,
and would have them for nothing. For how much is lettuce sold? Fifty
cents, for instance. If another, then, paying fifty cents, takes the
lettuce, and you, not paying it, go without them, don't imagine that
he has gained any advantage over you. For as he has the lettuce, so
you have the fifty cents which you did not give. So, in the present
case, you have not been invited to such a person's entertainment,
because you have not paid him the price for which a supper is sold.
It is sold for praise; it is sold for attendance. Give him then the
value, if it is for your advantage. But if you would, at the same
time, not pay the one and yet receive the other, you are insatiable,
and a blockhead. Have you nothing, then, instead of the supper? Yes,
indeed, you have: the not praising him, whom you don't like to praise;
the not bearing with his behavior at coming in. 

26. The will of nature may be learned from those things in which we
don't distinguish from each other. For example, when our neighbor's
boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, "These
things will happen." Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise
is broken, you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was
broken. Apply this in like manner to greater things. Is the child
or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, "This
is a human accident." but if anyone's own child happens to die, it
is presently, "Alas I how wretched am I!" But it should be remembered
how we are affected in hearing the same thing concerning others.

27. As a mark is not set up for the sake of missing the aim, so neither
does the nature of evil exist in the world. 

28. If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way,
you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing
over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens
to verbally attack you? 

29. In every affair consider what precedes and follows, and then undertake
it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit; but not having thought of
the consequences, when some of them appear you will shamefully desist.
"I would conquer at the Olympic games." But consider what precedes
and follows, and then, if it is for your advantage, engage in the
affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from
dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated
hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, nor sometimes
even wine. In a word, you must give yourself up to your master, as
to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch,
dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow dust, be whipped, and,
after all, lose the victory. When you have evaluated all this, if
your inclination still holds, then go to war. Otherwise, take notice,
you will behave like children who sometimes play like wrestlers, sometimes
gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy
when they have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be
at one time a wrestler, at another a gladiator, now a philosopher,
then an orator; but with your whole soul, nothing at all. Like an
ape, you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to
please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For
you have never entered upon anything considerately, nor after having
viewed the whole matter on all sides, or made any scrutiny into it,
but rashly, and with a cold inclination. Thus some, when they have
seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates (though,
indeed, who can speak like him?), have a mind to be philosophers too.
Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature
is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders,
your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different
things. Do you think that you can act as you do, and be a philosopher?
That you can eat and drink, and be angry and discontented as you are
now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain
appetites, must quit your acquaintance, be despised by your servant,
be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything,
in magistracies, in honors, in courts of judicature. When you have
considered all these things round, approach, if you please; if, by
parting with them, you have a mind to purchase apathy, freedom, and
tranquillity. If not, don't come here; don't, like children, be one
while a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one
of Caesar's officers. These things are not consistent. You must be
one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own ruling
faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within or
without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the vulgar.

30. Duties are universally measured by relations. Is anyone a father?
If so, it is implied that the children should take care of him, submit
to him in everything, patiently listen to his reproaches, his correction.
But he is a bad father. Is you naturally entitled, then, to a good
father? No, only to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, keep your
own situation towards him. Consider not what he does, but what you
are to do to keep your own faculty of choice in a state conformable
to nature. For another will not hurt you unless you please. You will
then be hurt when you think you are hurt. In this manner, therefore,
you will find, from the idea of a neighbor, a citizen, a general,
the corresponding duties if you accustom yourself to contemplate the
several relations. 

31. Be assured that the essential property of piety towards the gods
is to form right opinions concerning them, as existing "I and as governing
the universe with goodness and justice. And fix yourself in this resolution,
to obey them, and yield to them, and willingly follow them in all
events, as produced by the most perfect understanding. For thus you
will never find fault with the gods, nor accuse them as neglecting
you. And it is not possible for this to be effected any other way
than by withdrawing yourself from things not in our own control, and
placing good or evil in those only which are. For if you suppose any
of the things not in our own control to be either good or evil, when
you are disappointed of what you wish, or incur what you would avoid,
you must necessarily find fault with and blame the authors. For every
animal is naturally formed to fly and abhor things that appear hurtful,
and the causes of them; and to pursue and admire those which appear
beneficial, and the causes of them. It is impractical, then, that
one who supposes himself to be hurt should be happy about the person
who, he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible to be happy about
the hurt itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by a son, when he
does not impart to him the things which he takes to be good; and the
supposing empire to be a good made Polynices and Eteocles mutually
enemies. On this account the husbandman, the sailor, the merchant,
on this account those who lose wives and children, revile the gods.
For where interest is, there too is piety placed. So that, whoever
is careful to regulate his desires and aversions as he ought, is,
by the very same means, careful of piety likewise. But it is also
incumbent on everyone to offer libations and sacrifices and first
fruits, conformably to the customs of his country, with purity, and
not in a slovenly manner, nor negligently, nor sparingly, nor beyond
his ability. 

32. When you have recourse to divination, remember that you know not
what the event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; but
of what nature it is you know before you come, at least if you are
a philosopher. For if it is among the things not in our own control,
it can by no means be either good or evil. Don't, therefore, bring
either desire or aversion with you to the diviner (else you will approach
him trembling), but first acquire a distinct knowledge that every
event is indifferent and nothing to you., of whatever sort it may
be, for it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this
no one can hinder; then come with confidence to the gods, as your
counselors, and afterwards, when any counsel is given you, remember
what counselors you have assumed, and whose advice you will neglect
if you disobey. Come to divination, as Socrates prescribed, in cases
of which the whole consideration relates to the event, and in which
no opportunities are afforded by reason, or any other art, to discover
the thing proposed to be learned. When, therefore, it is our duty
to share the danger of a friend or of our country, we ought not to
consult the oracle whether we will share it with them or not. For,
though the diviner should forewarn you that the victims are unfavorable,
this means no more than that either death or mutilation or exile is
portended. But we have reason within us, and it directs, even with
these hazards, to the greater diviner, the Pythian god, who cast out
of the temple the person who gave no assistance to his friend while
another was murdering him. 

33. Immediately prescribe some character and form of conduce to yourself,
which you may keep both alone and in company. 

Be for the most part silent, or speak merely what is necessary, and
in few words. We may, however, enter, though sparingly, into discourse
sometimes when occasion calls for it, but not on any of the common
subjects, of gladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or
feasts, the vulgar topics of conversation; but principally not of
men, so as either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons. If you
are able, then, by your own conversation bring over that of your company
to proper subjects; but, if you happen to be taken among strangers,
be silent. 

Don't allow your laughter be much, nor on many occasions, nor profuse.

Avoid swearing, if possible, altogether; if not, as far as you are
able. 

Avoid public and vulgar entertainments; but, if ever an occasion calls
you to them, keep your attention upon the stretch, that you may not
imperceptibly slide into vulgar manners. For be assured that if a
person be ever so sound himself, yet, if his companion be infected,
he who converses with him will be infected likewise. 

Provide things relating to the body no further than mere use; as meat,
drink, clothing, house, family. But strike off and reject everything
relating to show and delicacy. 

As far as possible, before marriage, keep yourself pure from familiarities
with women, and, if you indulge them, let it be lawfully." But don't
therefore be troublesome and full of reproofs to those who use these
liberties, nor frequently boast that you yourself don't.

If anyone tells you that such a person speaks ill of you, don't make
excuses about what is said of you, but answer: " He does not know
my other faults, else he would not have mentioned only these."

It is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles;
but if ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, don't
appear more solicitous for anyone than for yourself; that is, wish
things to be only just as they are, and him only to conquer who is
the conqueror, for thus you will meet with no hindrance. But abstain
entirely from declamations and derision and violent emotions. And
when you come away, don't discourse a great deal on what has passed,
and what does not contribute to your own amendment. For it would appear
by such discourse that you were immoderately struck with the show.

Go not [of your own accord] to the rehearsals of any 
(authors) , nor appear [at them] readily. But, if you do appear, keepyour
gravity and sedateness, and at the same time avoid being morose.

When you are going to confer with anyone, and particularly of those
in a superior station, represent to yourself how Socrates or Zeno
would behave in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to make
a proper use of whatever may occur. 

When you are going to any of the people in power, represent to yourself
that you will not find him at home; that you will not be admitted;
that the doors will not be opened to you; that he will take no notice
of you. If, with all this, it is your duty to go, bear what happens,
and never say [to yourself], " It was not worth so much." For this
is vulgar, and like a man dazed by external things. 

In parties of conversation, avoid a frequent and excessive mention
of your own actions and dangers. For, however agreeable it may be
to yourself to mention the risks you have run, it is not equally agreeable
to others to hear your adventures. Avoid, likewise, an endeavor to
excite laughter. For this is a slippery point, which may throw you
into vulgar manners, and, besides, may be apt to lessen you in the
esteem of your acquaintance. Approaches to indecent discourse are
likewise dangerous. Whenever, therefore, anything of this sort happens,
if there be a proper opportunity, rebuke him who makes advances that
way; or, at least, by silence and blushing and a forbidding look,
show yourself to be displeased by such talk. 

34. If you are struck by the appearance of any promised pleasure,
guard yourself against being hurried away by it; but let the affair
wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to
your mind both points of time: that in which you will enjoy the pleasure,
and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself after you
have enjoyed it; and set before you, in opposition to these, how you
will be glad and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even though
it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that
its enticing, and agreeable and attractive force may not subdue you;
but set in opposition to this how much better it is to be conscious
of having gained so great a victory. 

35. When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be
done, never shun the being seen to do it, even though the world should
make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don't act right, shun
the action itself; but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who
censure you wrongly? 

36. As the proposition, "Either it is day or it is night," is extremely
proper for a disjunctive argument, but quite improper in a conjunctive
one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable
to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit
of an entertainment. When you eat with another, then, remember not
only the value of those things which are set before you to the body,
but the value of that behavior which ought to be observed towards
the person who gives the entertainment. 

37. If you have assumed any character above your strength, you have
both made an ill figure in that and quitted one which you might have
supported. 

38. When walking, you are careful not to step on a nail or turn your
foot; so likewise be careful not to hurt the ruling faculty of your
mind. And, if we were to guard against this in every action, we should
undertake the action with the greater safety. 

39. The body is to everyone the measure of the possessions proper
for it, just as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at
this, you will keep the measure; but if you move beyond it, you must
necessarily be carried forward, as down a cliff; as in the case of
a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to
be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that
which once exceeds a due measure, there is no bound. 

40. Women from fourteen years old are flattered with the title of
"mistresses" by the men. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded
only as qualified to give the men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves,
and in that to place ill their hopes. We should, therefore, fix our
attention on making them sensible that they are valued for the appearance
of decent, modest and discreet behavior. 

41. It is a mark of want of genius to spend much time in things relating
to the body, as to be long in our exercises, in eating and drinking,
and in the discharge of other animal functions. These should be done
incidentally and slightly, and our whole attention be engaged in the
care of the understanding. 

42. When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that
he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it
is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but
what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance,
he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if
anyone should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition
is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it. Setting out, then, from
these principles, you will meekly bear a person who reviles you, for
you will say upon every occasion, "It seemed so to him."

43. Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be carried,
the other by which it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, don't
lay hold on the action by the handle of his injustice, for by that
it cannot be carried; but by the opposite, that he is your brother,
that he was brought up with you; and thus you will lay hold on it,
as it is to be carried. 

44. These reasonings are unconnected: "I am richer than you, therefore
I am better"; "I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better."
The connection is rather this: "I am richer than you, therefore my
property is greater than yours;" "I am more eloquent than you, therefore
my style is better than yours." But you, after all, are neither property
nor style. 

45. Does anyone bathe in a mighty little time? Don't say that he does
it ill, but in a mighty little time. Does anyone drink a great quantity
of wine? Don't say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great quantity.
For, unless you perfectly understand the principle from which anyone
acts, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not run the
hazard of assenting to any appearances but such as you fully comprehend.

46. Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great deal among
the unlearned about theorems, but act conformably to them. Thus, at
an entertainment, don't talk how persons ought to eat, but eat as
you ought. For remember that in this manner Socrates also universally
avoided all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired
to be recommended by him to philosophers, he took and- recommended
them, so well did he bear being overlooked. So that if ever any talk
should happen among the unlearned concerning philosophic theorems,
be you, for the most part, silent. For there is great danger in immediately
throwing out what you have not digested. And, if anyone tells you
that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may
be sure that you have begun your business. For sheep don't throw up
the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly
digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. Thus,
therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but
the actions produced by them after they have been digested.

47. When you have brought yourself to supply the necessities of your
body at a small price, don't pique yourself upon it; nor, if you drink
water, be saying upon every occasion, "I drink water." But first consider
how much more sparing and patient of hardship the poor are than we.
But if at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to labor,
and bearing hard trials, do it for your own sake, and not for the
world; don't grasp statues, but, when you are violently thirsty, take
a little cold water in your mouth, and spurt it out and tell nobody.

48. The condition and characteristic of a vulgar person, is, that
he never expects either benefit or hurt from himself, but from externals.
The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is, that he expects
all hurt and benefit from himself. The marks of a proficient are,
that he censures no one, praises no one, blames no one, accuses no
one, says nothing concerning himself as being anybody, or knowing
anything: when he is, in any instance, hindered or restrained, he
accuses himself; and, if he is praised, he secretly laughs at the
person who praises him; and, if he is censured, he makes no defense.
But he goes about with the caution of sick or injured people, dreading
to move anything that is set right, before it is perfectly fixed.
He suppresses all desire in himself; he transfers his aversion to
those things only which thwart the proper use of our own faculty of
choice; the exertion of his active powers towards anything is very
gentle; if he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not care, and, in
a word, he watches himself as an enemy, and one in ambush.

49. When anyone shows himself overly confident in ability to understand
and interpret the works of Chrysippus, say to yourself, " Unless Chrysippus
had written obscurely, this person would have had no subject for his
vanity. But what do I desire? To understand nature and follow her.
I ask, then, who interprets her, and, finding Chrysippus does, I have
recourse to him. I don't understand his writings. I seek, therefore,
one to interpret them." So far there is nothing to value myself upon.
And when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make use of his
instructions. This alone is the valuable thing. But, if I admire nothing
but merely the interpretation, what do I become more than a grammarian
instead of a philosopher? Except, indeed, that instead of Homer I
interpret Chrysippus. When anyone, therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus
to him, I rather blush when I cannot show my actions agreeable and
consonant to his discourse. 

50. Whatever moral rules you have deliberately proposed to yourself.
abide by them as they were laws, and as if you would be guilty of
impiety by violating any of them. Don't regard what anyone says of
you, for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then,
will you put off thinking yourself worthy of the highest improvements
and follow the distinctions of reason? You have received the philosophical
theorems, with which you ought to be familiar, and you have been familiar
with them. What other master, then, do you wait for, to throw upon
that the delay of reforming yourself? You are no longer a boy, but
a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and
always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose,
and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will
insensibly continue without proficiency, and, living and dying, persevere
in being one of the vulgar. This instant, then, think yourself worthy
of living as a man grown up, and a proficient. Let whatever appears
to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of
pain or pleasure, or glory or disgrace, is set before you, remember
that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put
off. By once being defeated and giving way, proficiency is lost, or
by the contrary preserved. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving
himself by everything. attending to nothing but reason. And though
you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to live as one desirous
of becoming a Socrates. 

51. The first and most necessary topic in philosophy is that of the
use of moral theorems, such as, "We ought not to lie;" the second
is that of demonstrations, such as, "What is the origin of our obligation
not to lie;" the third gives strength and articulation to the other
two, such as, "What is the origin of this is a demonstration." For
what is demonstration? What is consequence? What contradiction? What
truth? What falsehood? The third topic, then, is necessary on the
account of the second, and the second on the account of the first.
But the most necessary, and that whereon we ought to rest, is the
first. But we act just on the contrary. For we spend all our time
on the third topic, and employ all our diligence about that, and entirely
neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that we lie, we are
immediately prepared to show how it is demonstrated that lying is
not right. 

52. Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:

"Conduct me, Jove, and you, 0 Destiny, 
Wherever your decrees have fixed my station." 
(Cleanthes)

"I follow cheerfully; and, did I not, 
Wicked and wretched, I must follow still 
Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed 
Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven." 
(Euripides, Frag. 965)

And this third: 

"0 Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be. Anytus and
Melitus may kill me indeed, but hurt me they cannot." 
(Plato's Crito and Apology)

On the Shortness of Life 
\
LUCIUS ANNAEUS SENECA \
TRANSLATED BY GARETH D. WILLIAMS \
\
\
\
(i.i) Most of mankind, Paulinus, complains about natures meanness, \
because our allotted span of life is so short, and because this stretch \
of time that is given to us runs its course so quickly, so rapidly \'97 so \
much so that, with very few exceptions, life leaves the rest of us in \
the lurch just when we re getting ready to live. And its not just the \
masses and the unthinking crowd that complain at what they per- \
ceive as this universal evil; the same feeling draws complaints even \
from men of distinction. Hence that famous dictum of the greatest \
of physicians: "Life is short, art long." 1 (2) Hence also Aristotle's \
grievance, 2 most unbecoming a philosopher, when he called nature \
to account for bestowing so much time on animals that they can live \
for five or ten human life spans, while so much shorter a limit is set \
for humans, even though they are born to do so many great things. \
\
(3) It's not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste \
much of it. Life is long enough, and it's been given to us in generous \
measure for accomplishing the greatest things, if the whole of it is \
well invested. But when life is squandered through soft and careless \
living, and when it's spent on no worthwhile pursuit, death finally \
presses and we realize that the life which we didn't notice passing \
has passed away. (4) So it is: the life we are given isn't short but we \
make it so; we're not ill provided but we are wasteful of life. Just as \
impressive and princely wealth is squandered in an instant when it \
passes into the hands of a poor manager, but wealth however modest \
grows through careful deployment if it is entrusted to a responsible \
guardian, just so our lifetime offers ample scope to the person who \
maps it out well. \
\
(2.1) Why do we complain about nature? It has acted generously: \
life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one person's held in the \
grip of voracious avarice, another by the kind of diligence that bus- \
ies itself with pointless enterprises. This one's sodden with wine, \
another slack with idleness. This one's tired out by his political ambi- \
tion, which always hangs on the judgment of others, while another's \
passionate desire for trading drives him headlong over every land \
\
\
\
and every sea in hope of profit. A passion for soldiering torments \
some men, who are always either bent on inflicting dangers on oth- \
ers or worried about danger to themselves. Some are worn down \
by the voluntary enslavement of thankless attendance on the great. \
(2) Many are kept busy either striving after other people's wealth or \
complaining about their own. Many who have no consistent goal in \
life are thrown from one new design to another by a fickleness that is \
shifting, never settled and ever dissatisfied with itself. Some have no \
goal at all toward which to steer their course, but death takes them \
by surprise as they gape and yawn. I cannot therefore doubt the truth \
of that seemingly oracular utterance of the greatest of poets: "Scant \
is the part of life in which we live." 3 All the rest of existence is not \
living but merely time. \
\
(3) Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don't allow \
us to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth; \
but they press down on them, keeping them lowered and fixed on \
mere desire. It's never possible for their victims to return to their \
true selves. If by chance they ever find some respite, they still roll \
restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind \
has settled; they never find full relaxation from their desires. (4) You \
think I'm talking only of those whose faults are admitted? Look at \
those whose prosperity draws crowds: they are choked by their own \
goods. How many have found their wealth a burden! How many are \
drained of their blood by their eloquence and their daily preoccupa- \
tion with showing off their abilities! How many are sickly pale from \
their incessant pleasures! How many are left with no freedom from \
the multitude of their besieging clients! In short, look over all of \
them from lowest to highest: this person summons counsel to plead \
his case, another answers the call; this one stands trial, another acts \
for the defense, another presides as judge; no one acts as his own \
champion, but each is wasted for another's sake. Ask about those in- \
fluential citizens whose names are studiously memorized, and you'll \
see that the following distinctions tell them apart: the first cultivates \
a second, the second a third; no one is his own man. (5) Again certain \
people give vent to the most irrational outbursts of anger: they com- \
plain about the haughtiness of their superiors, because the latter were \
too busy to receive them when they wanted an audience. Dare anyone \
complain about another's arrogance when he himself never has time \
\
\
\
to spare for himself? Yet the great man has occasionally, albeit with a \
disdainful expression, condescended to look on you, whoever you are; \
he has deigned to listen to your words, he has allowed you to walk \
at his side. But you never thought fit to look on yourself or to listen \
to yourself. And so you've no reason to expect a return from anyone \
for those attentions of yours, since you offered them not because you \
wanted another's company but because you were incapable of com- \
muning with yourself. \
\
(3.1) Though all the brilliant minds that have shone over the ages \
agree on this one point, they could never adequately express their \
astonishment at this dark fog in the human mind. No one lets anyone \
seize his estates, and if a trivial dispute arises about boundary lines, \
there's a rush to stones and arms; but people let others trespass on \
their existence \'97 or rather, they go so far as to invite in those who'll \
take possession of their lives. You'll find no one willing to distribute \
his money; but to how many people each of us shares out his life! \
Men are thrifty in guarding their private property, but as soon as it \
comes to wasting time, they are most extravagant with the one com- \
modity for which it's respectable to be greedy. \
\
(2) And so I'd like to collar one of the older crowd: "I see that \
you've reached the limit of human life, you're pressing hard on your \
hundredth year or more; come now, submit your life to an audit. Cal- \
culate how much of your time has been taken up by a moneylender, \
how much by a mistress, how much by a patron, how much by a cli- \
ent, how much in arguing with your wife, in punishing your slaves, in \
running about the city on social duties. Add to your calculations the \
illnesses that we've inflicted on ourselves, and also the time that has \
lain idle: you'll see that you've fewer years than you count. (3) Look \
back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few \
days turned out as you'd intended; when you were ever at your own \
disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind \
was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in \
such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without \
your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been \
lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms \
of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You'll \
come to realize that you're dying before your time." \
\
(4) What, then, is the reason for this? Your sort live as if you're \
\
\
\
going to live forever, your own human frailty never enters your head, \
you don't keep an eye on how much time has passed already. You \
waste time as if it comes from a source full to overflowing, when all \
the while that very day which is given over to someone or something \
may be your last. You're like ordinary mortals in fearing everything, \
you're like immortals in coveting everything. (5) You'll hear many say: \
"After my fiftieth year I'll retire to a life of leisure; my sixtieth year \
will bring release from all my duties." And what guarantee, may I \
ask, do you have that your life will last longer? Who will allow those \
arrangements of yours to proceed according to plan? Are you not \
ashamed to keep for yourself only the remnants of your existence, and \
to allocate to philosophical thought only that portion of time which \
can't be applied to any business? How late it is to begin living just \
when life must come to an end! What foolish obliviousness to our \
mortality to put off wise plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth year, and to \
want to begin life from a point that few have reached! \
\
(4.1) You'll find that the most powerful men of high position \
drop words in which they pray for leisure, praise it, and prefer it to \
all their blessings. They sometimes long to step down from that pin- \
nacle of theirs, if they can safely do so; for even without any external \
disturbance or shock, fortune crashes down on itself under its own \
weight. \
\
(2) The divine Augustus, to whom the gods gave more than to \
any man, never ceased to pray for rest for himself and to seek release \
from the affairs of state. Every conversation of his kept coming back \
to this theme, that he was hoping for leisure; he would relieve his \
toils with this sweet, even if illusory, consolation, the thought that \
one day he would live for himself. (3) In a letter that he sent to the \
senate, when he had given an assurance that his retirement would \
not be wanting in dignity and not be inconsistent with his former \
prestige, I find the following words: "But such things are more im- \
pressive in their fulfillment than in their promise. Yet my deep desire \
for that time, which I have long prayed for, has led me to anticipate \
something of its delight by the pleasure of words, since the joy of \
that reality is still slow in coming." 4 (4) Leisure seemed such a desir- \
able thing that, because he couldn't enjoy it in reality, he enjoyed the \
thought of it in advance. He who saw\'85}

INTRODUCTION \
\
\
senega\'92s life \
\
Lucius Annaeus Seneca was bom at Cordoba, then the \
leading town in Roman Spain, at about the same time as \
Christd His father, Marcus Annaeus Seneca, was an imperial \
procurator^ who became an authority on rhetoric, the art of \
public speaking and debate.^ He was the father not only of \
our Seneca, who speaks of his \'91old-fashioned strictness \
but also of Novatus, later knowm as GaUio, the governor of \
Achaea who declined to exercise jurisdiction over St Paul \
(Acts XVin, II-17), and of Mela, less ambitious than his \
brothers but an able financier (and father of the brilhant young \
poet Lucan). \
\
Seneca suffered severely from ill health, particularly asthma, \
throughout his life; he tells us that at one time the only thing \
which held him back from committing suicide was the \
thought of his father\'92s inability to bear the loss.^ He spent a \
period of his early life in Egypt (where the husband of a \
devoted aunt named Marcia was the viceroy \'91of the emperor \
Tiberius from a.d. 16 to 31), there acquiring experience in \
matters of administration and finance. He also studied the \
geography and ethnology of Egypt and India\'ae and developed a \
lasting interest in natural science, speculative rather than \
empirical (although Pliny speaks of him as an authority on \
geplogy, marine life and meteorology, and others have \
admired his remarks on, for example, evolution or the ex- \
planation of rings roimd the sxm). His interest was drawn at \
an early age to Pythagorean mysticism and various cults of \
eastern origin then gaining adherents in Rome, before his \
final acceptance, in large part, of the Stoic philosophy. \

\
INTRODUCTION \
\
\
After training for the bar he took successfully to public \
life, becoming quaestor in spite of the handicaps of his \
health, his foreign background and comparative lack of \
family or other connexions. When Caligula succeeded Tiberius \
in A.D. 37, Seneca had become a leading speaker in the \
Senate, and so aroused the jealousy\'92 of the new emperor that \
according to Dio Cassius he ordered his execution and was \
only induced to let him off by a woman close to the imperial \
throne who said that Seneca was \'91suffering from advanced \
tuberculosis and it would not be long before he died\'92.\'ae This \
incident apparently resulted in his temporary retirement from \
political affairs. \
\
In A.D. 41, in the first year of the reign of Caligula\'92s \
successor, Claudius, Seneca again came imder sentence of \
death - commuted to banishment - for reasons which we do \
not know. The pretext was adultery with Julia Livilla, the \
late emperor\'92s sister; the more likely explanation\'ae is that the \
new ruler\'92s consort, the notorious Messalina, considered him \
dangerous. His exile on the island of Corsica does not seem \
to have been endured as stoically as it might have been. The \
encouraging spirit of an essay of consolation sent to his dearly \
loved mother Helvia is entirely absent in another addressed \
to Polybius, an ex-slave who had become a trusted servant of \
the emperor, which contains some abject flattery and was \
probably never meant to be published. He had by now suffered \
the loss not only of his father but of a son, and his first wife \
died while he was away. The only solace for him in these \
eight long years of loneliness and near, despair was the \
reception given to the poems, tragedies and essays to fiiends \
which he continued composing during his banishment. \
\
His fortunes turned dramatically in A.D. 49. Messalina had \
been executed and the emperor\'92s new wife, Agrippina, had \
Seneca recalled to Rome, appointed to the high office of \
praetor and made tutor to her twelve-year-old son Lucius \
\
\
\
INTRODUCTION \
\
\
Domitius Ahenobarbus (the boy wlio was shortly to become \
the emperor Nero). Agrippina's motives, according to \
Tacitus, apart from the instruction of her son, were a confi- \
dence that because of his \'91literary fame\'92 die move would \
gain them popularity, and a belief that he would prove a \
reliable ally and a useful adviser to herself and Nero in their \
plans for future power.^\'b0 \
\
There is no evidence that Seneca was connected with the \
poisoning of Claudius in a.d. 54. But he wrote the speeches \
wliich the seventeen-year-old Nero delivered after his \
accession, and was probably the author of a witty, if to us a \
little tasteless, attack on the dead ruler\'92s memory (the \
Apocolocytitosis or \'91Pumpkinification\'92, an imaginary tale of \
the rebuffs received by the recently deceased emperor when \
he presents himself at the portals of Heaven and his applica- \
tion for admission is debated by the Gods). Nero did make a- \
formal speech in honour of his predecessor, which was said \
to display \'91a great deal of polish\'92 and to be a good example of \
Seneca\'92s \'91attractive style, well tuned to the ears of his time\'92.^^ \
\
The new regime opened well and \'91Nero\'92s first five years\'92 \
were later spoken of as a period of unequalled good govern- \
ment, the emperor Trajan even calling them the finest period \
in the history of imperial Rome.^^ For this Rome was in-, \
debted to Seneca and an army officer named Burrus. These \
two, \'91the most influential as well as the most enlightened of \
the men who surroimded Nero\'92 (Dio),^^ \'91whose, wide \
experience was conmion knowledge\'92 (Tacitus),\'92^*\'92\'92 prevented \
the hot-headed yormg man from carrying out a lot of murders \
on his accession and aimed at chaimelling some of his energies \
into \'91permissible pleasures\'92.^\'ae Only briefly alarmed by the \
, poisoiung of Britannicus and acting throughout in complete \
harmony they succeeded in keeping public business out of \
Agrippina\'92s hands and in their own., Tacitus ascribes the \
secret of the influence of Seneca to \'91his tuition of Nero in \

\
public speaking, and his engaging manners and high princi- \
ples , that of Burrus to \'91his military responsibilities and \
austerity of character\'92/\'ae \
\
The two of them \'91took over total power, and exercised it, \
to the utmost of their ability, in the best and justest way \
conceivable, thus each alike" arousing all men\'92s approval\'92 \
(Dio)/\'92\'92' While Nero amused himself they set about the \
problems of government; we notice - to give instances of \
their activity - legal and financial reforms including the \
reduction of indirect taxation and steps to prevent peculation \
and extortion by provincial governors, and the prosecution of \
a successful war in Armenia to settle the empire\'92s eastern \
firontier. Seneca\'92s geographical interests appear in the dis- \
patch of an expedition \'91to investigate the soinrce of the \
Nile , Yet another of his interests was shorthand, the Roman \
system of which he is said to have completely revised. \
\
Neither he nor , Burrus appears to have held any standing \
legal or constitutional office that could be said to give them \
the authority they wielded during these years. Seneca, \'91the \
real master of the world seems simply to have been the \
moving force behind the throne. It is probably safe to say \
that Nero (unlike Aristotle\'92s celebrated pupil at a similar age, \
Alexander the Great) was still imder the influence of a \
teacher of imdoubted personal charm, and was quite content \
to leave to him the direction of affairs in which he had little \
real interest. Once the yoimg emperor began to hsten to \
other advisers and increasingly to indulge his more violent \
and vindictive impulses this happy situation was doomed. \
\
In A.D. 58 Seneca was being attacked by people like \
Publius Suilhus Rufus.^^ Accusations seem to have ranged in \
gravity from sleeping with the emperor\'92s mother (obviously \
the man had failed to learn his lesson from his \'91thoroughly \
deserved\'92 banishment for \'91seducing imperial princesses ) and \
the introduction of the emperor to paederasty, to the use- \

lessness of his studies and the affectedness of his oratorical \
style. But the campaign against him generally centred on \
the apparent contrast - it has been a stock criticism of Seneca \
right down the centuries - betw-een his philosophical teach- \
ings and his practice. Instances of tliis hypocrisy, according to \
Suillius, were the philosopher\'92s denunciations of tyranny, \
which did not stop him from being tutor to a tyrant; of \
flattery, ill according with the attitude he had adopted, \
especially from exile, towards ex-slaves who headed depart- \

of (allegedly) giving banquets served at five hundred identical \

INTRODUCTION

i

n his tent at the front near the Granua River in the distant territory
of Germania, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius rose at dawn. It was a
struggle for him to get up this early, but he did anyway; his job required
it. In the lamplight, he sat at the table and began to write in Greek in
his journal about what the day ahead held in store for him. “I will
encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and
cranks,” he wrote to himself, preparing mentally for the inevitable
difficulties of the life of an emperor, particularly one faced with leading
an army and overseeing the empire from abroad.
But don’t assume this was a complaint. There was not a note of
frustration or resentment in his tone.
Marcus Aurelius was practicing with pleasure the philosophy he’d
come to love and depend on, Stoicism. He was not writing off his fellow
men and his subjects. On the contrary, in the completion of that
thought, he would say of those busybodies and ingrates “that none can
do me harm, or implicate me in ugliness—nor can I be angry at my
relatives or hate them. For we are made for cooperation.” And so he
went about the rest of his morning journaling, writing little notes for
himself on how to think, how to live, what to be grateful for, and then
he proceeded on to meet the day, not simply as a philosopher, but as a
true philosopher king.
If we can go back in time a little further, almost exactly one century
and one evening before Marcus’s morning meditation, we’d find
another Stoic philosopher doing something quite similar. His name
was Seneca, and he was alternatively a powerbroker, a playwright, and
public intellectual serving at the highest levels in the court of Nero.
Instead of journaling in the morning, he preferred to do his at night,
putting, as he said, each day up for review. Seneca would look back on
the day just then coming to a close and ask himself whether his actions
had been just, what he could have done better, what habits he could
curb, how he might improve himself. “We reflect upon that which we
are about to do,” he would tell his older brother about this nightly
routine, “and yet our plans for the future descend from the past.”

INTRODUCTION

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

Reviewing the previous day is what helped Seneca prepare for the one
that he would face the following morning.
Epictetus, another famous Stoic, was a former slave who lived a life
not nearly as cushy or powerful as Seneca or Marcus, and would
repeatedly remind his students to rehearse their lessons, to write them
down for their own use. In Discourses, he says, “Every day and night
keep thoughts like these at hand—write them, read them aloud, talk
to yourself and others about them.”
These then, the morning preparation and the evening review, are
two of the most essential and intertwining exercises in Stoic philoso­
phy and a tradition now more than two thousand years old. It’s a tra­
dition that you, in holding The Daily Stoic Journal, are now an heir to
and can continue twice per day in your pursuit of the good life.
Unlike many other philosophies, Stoicism wasn’t designed simply to
be some explanation of the universe. It wasn’t overly interested in com­
plicated questions about where we came from or theoretical discus­
sions of this issue or that one. Stoicism was designed by the Greeks and
perfected by the Romans for the living and the doing of daily life for
the man and woman trying to make it in a confusing world. As such,
it was much more than a set of teachings or long-ago written sentences.
It was instead a set of timeless practical exercises—systems for reduc­
ing fear, thoughts for battling destructive thoughts, reminders of things
we take for granted, tools for resisting temptation, pillars of strength
for tough moments. This meant that Stoicism wasn’t something to be
learned once or read once. It was meant to be studied and practiced.
Consider the title of Marcus Aurelius’s only work, Meditations. He
was meditating, to himself, for himself, on the philosophic principles
he was still learning and practicing even in old age. A peek at Seneca’s
letters finds the same thing—he is writing to someone else, yes, but
clearly the intended audience is also himself. He is thinking out loud.
Epictetus, too, survives in the form of notes written by his student
Arrian, and they read as if his day was spent trying to answer the end­
less questions of his students: What do I do about this? How can I
handle something like that? Any advice for when I
?
In our book The Daily Stoic, we tried to bring a collection of this
wisdom to busy readers in a digestible and accessible way. Instead of
translating and republishing the Stoics in their original form (which
has been done quite well, many times), we created the first ever single-

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

INTRODUCTION

volume collection of all the great Stoics, arranged to highlight a thought
from one each day. The response to the book was humbling and surpris­
ing. The book spent three months on the national bestseller lists and
debuted in the form of a keynote address at what was likely the largest
single gathering of Stoics in two thousand years. Our accompanying
daily e-mail at DailyStoic.com was inundated with sign-ups, meaning
that each morning tens of thousands of aspiring Stoics were all reading
the same thing at the same time. We also began to see photos online
from readers who had filled up the pages of The Daily Stoic and Moleskine journals with thoughts inspired by each day’s meditation.
In response, we set out to create this journal, a companion guide to
The Daily Stoic and a resource to anyone trying to practice the philos­
ophy. We’re honored that you now hold it in your hands.
HOW TO USE THIS JOURNAL
This book presents fifty-two Stoic disciplines or practices, one for each
week of the year. Each practice is presented with some direction about
its significance and application, along with a few quotes from the great
Stoics to help focus your attention on the practice for the week—the
first quote about each weekly practice is taken directly from that same
week in The Daily Stoic. Each day presents a question to help you focus
your morning preparations or evening review (or both). The questions
will work for you whether you are reading along with The Daily Stoic,
using our daily e-mail readings, or any other source.
We have not written a set of commandments or a step-by-step sys­
tem that must be adhered to unthinkingly (if you don’t want to respond
to the prompts, ignore them and write about whatever you feel would
be most beneficial. We also have suggestions at the back for other
sources to use). As Seneca said: “The ones who pioneered these paths
aren’t our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone; it
hasn’t been monopolized.”
The reason these Stoic practices have been so enduring (and are
enjoying a modern-day resurgence) is that they are relentlessly focused
on the situations that we face on a daily basis, what Richard Sorabji
calls “the ordinary ups and downs of life, on bereavement, loss of
office, promotion, the rat race, money, invasions, the sacking of cities,
exile, worries about health.” As the American philosopher Brand Blanshard marveled at Marcus Aurelius’s legacy:

INTRODUCTION

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

“Few care now about the marches and countermarches of the
Roman commanders. What the centuries have clung to is a note­
book of thoughts by a man whose real life was largely unknown
who put down in the midnight dimness not the events of the day
or the plans of the morrow, but something of far more permanent
interest, the ideals and aspirations that a rare spirit lived by.”
The Roman Stoics focused not on words, but action. As Seneca
memorably put it, “Philosophy teaches us how to act, not how to talk.”
This bias toward improving our actions on a daily basis was something
Epictetus made central to his teaching, summarized in his warning
“not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then
training.”
This journal is a place to focus your attention (prosoche) and prac­
tice (melete) as you try to remember and apply what you are learning
on the path to progress (prokope). When you pursue the Stoic disci­
plines presented in this journal, each morning you will ask, as the great
modern Stoic Pierre Hadot put it, “What principles will guide and
inspire my actions?” And each evening you will examine where you fell
short of those principles, as well as where you have made progress. You
can begin on any calendar date you choose and proceed until the book
is complete.
Together, the fifty-two ideals and aspirations offer something for
every situation. Whether it’s dealing with bad habits like complaining
(Week XXXI), procrastination (Week XXXV), or panic (Week XXXIX),
or finding less destructive alternatives to anger (Week XXIX), fear of
the future (Week XXXIV), or dealing with haters (Week XXXVIII),
you will find practical tools to put to use. You will gain powerful per­
spective by learning the exercise of taking “the view from above”
(Week XXII), or learning to see things as others do (Week XI), and by
taking on a role model (Week XXIII). You’ll train yourself in the Stoic
basics like the dichotomy of control (Week I), focus on the present
moment (Week V), or how to test your impressions (Week XV).
It’s important to remember this isn’t a contest to see if you can live
like some perfect sage or escape the correction of someone farther along
the path than you. Anyone who uses philosophy that way is decidedly
un-Stoic! As Seneca reminded us, “Let philosophy scrape off your own
faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.” Think

THE DAILY STOIC JOURNAL

INTRODUCTION

of this journal as a brush for your own soul, just like brushing your
teeth each morning and each evening.
The final lesson at the end of this book is the most essential one of
all of Stoic philosophy: learning how to turn words into works. We
hope you will make it that far, and if you do, we encourage you to start
the same journey once again the following year, for you will be, as
Heraclitus said, no longer the same person nor will this be the same
book.

WEEK I
WHAT’S UP TO US, WHAT’S NOT UP TO US

r pictetus’s handbook (the Enchiridion) begins with the most powerL— ful exercise in all of Stoicism: the distinction between the things
that are “up to us” (in our control) and the things that are “not up to
us.” It is this, the dichotomy of control, that is the first principle in the
entire philosophy. We don’t control many of the things we pursue in
life—yet we become angry, sad, hurt, scared, or jealous when we don’t
get them. In fact, those emotions—those reactions—are about the only
thing that we do control. If that is the only lesson you journal about or
remember for this year, consider it a year well and philosophically
lived.
“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate mat­
ters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not
under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actu­
ally control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to
uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are
my own . ..”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.5.4-5

“Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control
our opinion, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything
of our own doing. We don’t control our body, property, reputa­
tion, position, and, in a word, everything not of our own doing.
Even more, the things in our control are by nature free, unhin­
dered, and unobstructed, while those not in our control are weak,
slavish, can be hindered, and are not our own.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion 1.1-2

“We control our reasoned choice and all acts that depend on that
moral will. What’s not under our control are the body and any of
its parts, our possessions, parents, siblings, children, or country—
anything with which we might associate.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.22.10

WEEK II
THE SPHERE OF CHOICE

i

f the first step is to discern what is or isn’t in our control, the second
is to focus our energy on the things we have a choice about. The Sto­
ics viewed the soul as a sphere that, when well tuned, well directed,
was an invincible fortress against any trial or circumstance. Protected
by our reason, this sphere of choice (prohairesis) is like a sacred temple
and is the only thing we truly possess in life. We are the product of our
choices, so it is essential then that we choose well. This week, consider
and reflect on the choices you have: about your emotions, your actions,
your beliefs, and your priorities.
“Keep this thought at the ready at daybreak, and through the day
and night—there is only one path to happiness, and that is in
giving up all outside of your sphere of choice, regarding nothing
else as your possession, surrendering all else to God and Fortune.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.4.39
“Who then is invincible? The one who cannot be upset by anything
outside their reasoned choice.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.18.21
“The soul is a sphere, true to itself. It neither projects itself toward
any external thing nor does it collapse on itself, but instead radi­
ates a light which it shows itself the truth of all things and the
truth in itself.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.12

ach day you write in this journal, you’ll be following in the footsteps
of Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and all the other great Stoics. The
Stoics did not face each day on a whim, but instead with preparation
and discipline. They spent real time thinking and anticipating what
was to come over the course of a day, a week, a year. Each morning
activity—journaling included—was designed to make them ready to
face the day. And with your work in this book, so you will be, too.
“Ask yourself the following first thing in the morning:
• What am I lacking in attaining freedom from passion?
• What for tranquility?
• What am I? A mere body, estate-holder, or reputation? None
of these things.
• What, then? A rational being.
• What then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions.
• How did I steer away from serenity?
• What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring?
• What did I fail to do in all these things?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.6.34-35
“On those mornings you struggle with getting up, keep this thought
in mind—I am awakening to the work of a human being. Why
then am I annoyed that I am going to do what I’m made for, the
very things for which I was put into this world? Or was I made
for this, to snuggle under the covers and keep warm? It’s so plea­
surable. Were you then made for pleasure? In short, to be coddled
or to exert yourself?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.1

A LITTLE BETTER EVERY DAY

T

he Stoics saw their lives as works in progress. They didn’t believe
they were born perfect but they believed that with work, and ded­
ication, they could get a little better every day. There is real delight in
this progress, as Epictetus quoted by way of Socrates. Marcus Aurelius
avidly pursued his own education and improvement, eagerly looking
for advice from books, mentors, and historical examples. Follow that
example this week, and see how you get a little better as each day
passes.
We must keep constant watch over ourselves and, as Seneca phrased
it, put each day up for review. Looking back on our day helps us to
better understand where we may have fallen short and gives us tangible
feedback for how to improve and grow. Only what you measure and
record can be monitored; only what you put up for reflection can be
learned from.
“I will keep constant watch over myself and—most usefully—will
put each day up for review. For this is what makes us evil—that
none of us looks back upon our own lives. We reflect upon only
that which we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future
descend from the past.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 83.2
“From Rusticus ... I learned to read carefully and not be satisfied
with a rough understanding of the whole, and not to agree too
quickly with those who have a lot to say about something.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 1.7.3
“But what does Socrates say? ‘Just as one person delights in improv­
ing his farm, and another his horse, so I delight in attending to
my own improvement day by day.*”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.5.14

FOCUS ON THE PRESENT MOMENT

arcus Aurelius ruled at a particularly turbulent time. Wars erupted
1 I on multiple fronts. Terrible plagues ravaged Rome. His rule was
certainly one of constant, unrelenting pressure. But he never let it over­
whelm him. From the Stoics and from the example of his adoptive father,
the Emperor Antoninus Pius, Marcus found a coping strategy in always
sticking close to the present moment and the duties at hand. When our
own stress boils over, we can remember his practices and exercises, to
stick with what is in front of us and not everything it might mean.
“At every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a
Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity,
affection, freedom, and justice—giving yourself a break from all
other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task
as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subver­
sion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your
fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it
possible to live an abundant and devout life.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5
“Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multi­
ple of that, keep in mind that no one ever loses a life other than
the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the
one they are losing. The longest and the shortest life, then, amount
to the same, for the present moment lasts the same for all and is
all anyone possesses. No one can lose either the past or the future,
for how can someone be deprived of what’s not theirs?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.14
“Don’t let your reflection on the whole sweep of life crush you.
Don’t fill your mind with all the bad things that might still hap­
pen. Stay focused on the present situation and ask yourself why
it’s so unbearable and can’t be survived.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, S.36

SUSPEND YOUR OPINIONS

£ pictetus would teach that opinions were “the cause of a troubled
Lm mind.” Opinions about the way we think things should be, need to
be. One of the Stoic words for “opinion” is “dogma.” The practice of
Stoicism begins with a relentless attempt to suspend this dogmatic way
of living—a cessation of the belief that you can force your opinions and
expectations onto the world.
“We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not
let it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power
to shape our judgments.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.52
“Today I escaped from the crush of circumstances, or better put, I
threw them out, for the crush wasn’t from outside me but in my
own assumptions.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.13
“There are two things that must be rooted out in human beings—
arrogant opinion and mistrust. Arrogant opinion expects that
there is nothing further needed, and mistrust assumes that under
the torrent of circumstance there can be no happiness.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.14.8
“Throw out your conceited opinions, for it is impossible for a per­
son to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.17.1

WATCH OVER YOUR PERCEPTIONS

r very moment brings a flood of impressions of the world around us,
L- and our minds are filled with the perceptions that arise with them.
The Stoics teach us that we must keep a constant watch on this flood,
as if we are standing guard to protect something of vital importance.
What is it that we are protecting? Our peace of mind, clarity, and
freedom—all of which are anchored in our perceptions. Epictetus reminds
us that we need to pay attention to what matters and to learn how to
ignore so many of the relentless provocations that come our way.
“Keep constant guard over your perceptions, for it is no small thing
you are protecting, but your respect, trustworthiness and steadi­
ness, peace of mind, freedom from pain and fear, in a word your
freedom. For what would you sell these things?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.6b-8

“An important place to begin in philosophy is this: a clear percep­
tion of one’s own ruling principle.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.26.15

“I don’t agree with those who plunge headlong into the middle of
the flood and who, accepting a turbulent life, struggle daily in
great spirit with difficult circumstances. The wise person will
endure that, but won’t choose it—choosing to be at peace, rather
than at war.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 28.7

REDUCE WANTS, INCREASE HAPPINESS

THhe Stoics knew that wanting less increases gratitude, just as wantI ing more obliterates it. Epictetus focused much of his teaching on
helping his students reduce the destructive habit of wanting more. In it
he saw the key to a happy life and relationships. By practicing the art
of wanting less and being grateful for the portion that we already have
before us, we are hopping off the so-called hedonic treadmill and tak­
ing a real step on the path to a life of real contentment.
“Remember to conduct yourself in life as if at a banquet. As some­
thing being passed around comes to you, reach out your hand and
take a moderate helping. Does it pass you by? Don’t stop it. It hasn’t
yet come? Don’t burn in desire for it, but wait until it arrives in
front of you. Act this way with children, a spouse, toward posi­
tion, with wealth—one day it will make you worthy of a banquet
with the gods.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 15

“When children stick their hand down a narrow goody jar they
can’t get their full fist out and start crying. Drop a few treats and
you will get it out! Curb your desire—don’t set your heart on so
many things and you will get what you need.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.9.22

“Freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart’s desire but by
removing your desire.”

CULTIVATE INDIFFERENCE

Q ome people spend their lives chasing good things: health, wealth,
O pleasure, achievement. Others try to avoid the bad things with equal
energy: sickness, poverty, pain. These look like two drastically differ­
ent approaches but in the end, they are the same. The Stoics continually
reminded themselves that so many of the things we desire and avoid
are beyond our control. Instead of chasing impossibilities, the Stoics
trained to be equally prepared and equally suited to thrive in either
condition. They trained to be indifferent. This is a great power and the
cultivation of this skill is a very powerful exercise.
“Of all the things that are, some are good, others bad, and yet oth­
ers indifferent. The good are virtues and all that share in them;
the bad are the vices and all that indulge them; the indifferent lie
in between virtue and vice and include wealth, health, life, death,
pleasure, and pain.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.19.1 2b-13
“My reasoned choice is as indifferent to the reasoned choice of my
neighbor, as to his breath and body. However much we’ve been
made for cooperation, the ruling reason in each of us is master of
its own affairs. If this weren’t the case, the evil in someone else
could become my harm, and God didn’t mean for someone else
to control my misfortune.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.56
“There are things in life which are advantageous and disadvanta­
geous—both beyond our control.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 92.16

WHAT EXPENSIVE THINGS COST

PJ rom the Cynics, the Stoics learned the powerful practice of focusing
I on the true worth (axia) of things. That the cost of an item isn’t
simply what it’s sold for, but what it costs the owner to own. So much
of our desire for material goods comes at the great price of both anxi­
ety and the loss of our serenity—and even when gained, these things
often leave us more anxious and less serene. This week, spend some
time reflecting on what the things you buy actually cost. See if they are
really worth what you have been paying.
“So, concerning the things we pursue, and for which we vigorously
exert ourselves, we owe this consideration—either there is noth­
ing useful in them, or most aren’t useful. Some of them are super­
fluous, while others aren’t worth that much. But we don’t discern
this and see them as free, when they cost us dearly.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 42.6

“If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be furi­
ous. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along,
so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled—have
you no shame in that?”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 28

“Diogenes of Sinope said we sell things of great value for things of
very little, and vice versa.”

WEEK XI
THINK ABOUT IT FROM THE OTHER
PERSON’S PERSPECTIVE

w

e tend to assume the best about our own intentions and the worst
about other people’s. Then we wonder why life is so full of con­
flict! The Stoics flipped this habit around, reminding themselves to be
suspicious about their own first reaction and to approach others first
with sympathy. Powerful people are often surprisingly terrible at
behaving this way, but Marcus Aurelius, the most powerful man on
earth during his reign, was renowned for his humanity in dealing with
others. He told himself to always take a moment to remember his own
failings and to contemplate how another might see a situation. He
reminded himself, as we should, that most people are trying their best,
even though that’s easy to lose sight of in the rough and tumble of daily
life. Let’s remember that this week and think about each interaction
from more than just our own point of view.
“Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately con­
sider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when
you see that, you’ll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or
rage. For you may yourself have the same notions of good and
evil, or similar ones, in which case you’ll make an allowance for
what they’ve done. But if you no longer hold the same notions,
you’ll be more readily gracious for their error.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.26
“When your sparring partner scratches or head-butts you, you
don’t then make a show of it, or protest, or view him with suspi­
cion or as plotting against you. And yet you keep an eye on him,
not as an enemy or with suspicion, but with a healthy avoidance.
You should act this way with all things in life. We should give a
pass to many things with our fellow trainees. For, as I’ve said, it’s
possible to avoid without suspicion or hate.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.20

THE PORTABLE RETREAT

i

t is in the future—on a vacation, on our day off, when we plan to get
out into nature—that we think we’ll find peace and release from the
crush of the everyday demands of life. Yet this never seems to really
happen as often as we think, does it? And when we do get that peace,
it is difficult to keep once we’re back in the fray. For a Stoic, all of this
is madness. The true retreat is to the freedom of our own mind and
soul, to consider the gifts we already have that can be our refuge for ail
time. If we take the time, daily, to do so.
“People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or
in the mountains. You are very much in the habit of yearning for
those same things. But this is entirely the trait of a base person,
when you can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself. For
nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than
in your own soul—especially if on close inspection it is filled with
ease, which I say is nothing more than being well-ordered. Treat
yourself often to this retreat and be renewed.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.3.1
“Remember that it’s not only the desire for wealth and position
that debases and subjugates us, but also the desire for peace, leisure,
travel, and learning. It doesn’t matter what the external thing is,
the value we place on it subjugates us to another... where our heart
is set, there our impediment lies.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.4.1-2; 15
“Remember that your ruling reason becomes unconquerable when
it rallies and relies on itself, so that it won’t do anything contrary
to its own will, even if its position is irrational. How much more
unconquerable if its judgments are careful and made rationally?
Therefore, the mind freed from passions is an impenetrable
fortress—a person has no more secure place of refuge for all time.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.48

SAY NO TO THE NEED TO IMPRESS

i

f the desire to impress and be liked by others is innate to humans as
a species, then every generation born before social media got off
lucky. Today we face an unending stream of status updates demanding
to be filled with all the impressive things we are doing, the trials we are
overcoming, announcements of our dangers averted and triumphs real­
ized. It’s exhausting. Centuries ago, Epictetus saw this pride and nar­
cissism even in his (computerless) students and reminded them it wasn’t
so innocent. In fact, he told them that it would destroy their life’s pur­
pose, it would distract and fatigue them. Seneca, too, saw this seeking
of the approval of spectators as one of life’s disgraces. Watch those
impulses this week, notice how much you seem to need your phone and
status updates and then ask: Is this the kind of person I want to be? Is
this what a philosopher would do?
“If you should ever turn your will to things outside your control in
order to impress someone, be sure that you have wrecked your
whole purpose in life. Be content, then, to be a philosopher in all
that you do, and if you wish also to be seen as one, show yourself
first that you are and you will succeed.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 23
“In public avoid talking often and excessively about your accom­
plishments and dangers, for however much you enjoy recounting
your dangers, it’s not so pleasant for others to hear about your
affairs.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 33.14
“How disgraceful is the lawyer whose dying breath passes while at
court, at an advanced age, pleading for unknown litigants and
still seeking the approval of ignorant spectators.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 20.2

WHAT CAN GO WRONG . . . MIGHT

w

e call the people who dwell on what might go wrong “pessimists.”
Some even think that bad thoughts attract bad events. The Sto­
ics found this all to be nonsense. In fact, they had a practice oipraemeditatio malorwn (premeditation of evils) that specifically encouraged
musing on the so-called worst-case scenario. Marcus would begin his
day thinking about all the ugliness he would see on display at court—
not for the purpose of working himself up, but precisely the opposite,
to calm and focus himself to be prepared to act in the proper way rather
than to react. Seneca, too, practiced meditating in advance, not only
about what normally happens, but what could happen. Epictetus went
as far as to imagine losing a loved one every time he would kiss them.
The Stoics believed all that we have is on loan from Fortune, and that
negative visualization helps increase our awareness of the unexpected—
don’t shy away from this in your thoughts.
“When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter
busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks.
They are all stricken with these afflictions because they don’t
know the difference between good and evil. Because I have under­
stood the beauty of good and the ugliness of evil, I know that
these wrongdoers are still akin to me ... and that none can do me
harm, or implicate me in ugliness—nor can I be angry at my
relatives or hate them. For we are made for cooperation.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.1
“Being unexpected adds to the weight of a disaster, and being a
surprise has never failed to increase a person’s pain. For that rea­
son, nothing should ever be unexpected by us. Our minds should
be sent out in advance to all things and we shouldn’t just consider
the normal course of things, but what could actually happen. For
is there anything in life that Fortune won’t knock off its high
horse if it pleases her?”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 91.3a-4

TEST YOUR IMPRESSIONS

^^\ne of Epictetus’s key teachings was about testing all our
impressions—any experience, perception, or circumstance that
we find in front of us. He uses a key verb to emphasize this practice,
dokimdzd, ten times in the Discourses and once in the opening of the
Enchiridion. The word carries the meaning of the assayer, one who
tests fine metals and coins to verify their authenticity. In one of the
most memorable uses Epictetus compares our need to test impressions
to what is done with coins and how the skilled merchant can hear a
counterfeit coin cast upon a table just as a musician would detect a sour
note. This week, let us go through the exercise of assaying everything
that comes before us, assuming it all to be counterfeit or misleading
until we can prove otherwise.
“When it comes to money, where we feel our clear interest, we have
an entire art where the tester uses many means to discover the
worth . . . just as we give great attention to judging things that
might steer us badly. But when it comes to our own ruling princi­
ple, we yawn and doze off, accepting any appearance that flashes
by without counting the cost.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.20.8; 11

“First off, don’t let the force of the impression carry you away. Say
to it, ‘hold up a bit and let me see who you are and where you are
from—let me put you to the test.’..
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.24

“From the very beginning, make it your practice to say to every
harsh impression, ‘you are an impression and not at all what you
appear to be.’ Next, examine and test it by the rules you possess,
the first and greatest of which is this—whether it belongs to the
things in our control or not in our control, and if the latter, be
prepared to respond, ‘It is nothing to me.*”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 1.5

IMPULSE CONTROL

i

f something is making you upset, write it here and look at it. What
happened? Who caused it? Now think about your reaction: What did
you say? What did you feel? Did this make it better or worse? Marcus
Aurelius, as emperor, clearly had many people and causes to be upset
about. He also had real power and authority. Even so we find that he
would tell himself, “You have power over your mind—not outside
events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” So, too, with what has
happened to you—you did not control what happened, but you do
control which impulses you follow in the wake of it.
“Epictetus says we must discover the missing art of assent and pay
special attention to the sphere of our impulses—that they are
subject to reservation, to the common good, and that they are in
proportion to actual worth.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.37

“You say, good fortune used to meet you at every corner. But the
fortunate person is the one who gives themselves a good fortune.
And good fortunes are a well-tuned soul, good impulses, and
good actions.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.36

“Frame your thoughts like this—you are an old person, you won’t
let yourself be enslaved by this any longer, no longer pulled like a
puppet by every impulse, and you’ll stop complaining about your
present fortune or dreading the future.”
—Marcus Aurelius, MEDiTATioNSy 2.2

THE FREEDOM OF CONTEMPT

^T"he language we use to describe things imputes value to those things.
I We often embellish our language with superlatives to help make
our choices of what to buy, wear, eat, or drink seem much better than
they really are. As emperor, Marcus Aurelius could have the finest
Falernian wine at his table at any meal—but he preferred to remind
himself it was only grape juice. As emperor, he was the only Roman
allowed to wear a purple cloak, but he took pains to point out that his
cloak was like any other, just dyed with shellfish blood to produce the
purple hue. This week, practice cutting your own luxuries and the
things you yearn for down to size with a little contempt. Describe them
with the bluntest language you can—and see how much their power
over you diminishes.
“Just as when meat or other foods are set before us we think, this
is a dead fish, a dead bird or pig; and also, this fine wine is only
the juice of a bunch of grapes, this purple-edged robe just sheep’s
wool dyed in a bit of blood from a shellfish; or of sex, that it
is only rubbing private parts together followed by a spasmic
discharge—in the same way our impressions grab actual events
and permeate them, so we see them as they really are.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.13
“Keep a list before your mind of those who burned with anger and
resentment about something, of even the most renowned for suc­
cess, misfortune, evil deeds, or any special distinction. Then ask
yourself, how did that work out? Smoke and dust, the stuff of
simple myth trying to be legend ...”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.27
“You know what wine and liqueur tastes like. It makes no differ­
ence whether a hundred or a thousand bottles pass through your
bladder—you are nothing more than a filter.”

SHOW, DON’T TELL

T"he art of living isn’t a set of teachings or a formula we can memoI rize. It’s a practice that requires constant work. Epictetus was con­
stantly reminding his students not to parrot back what they’d heard in
the lecture hall or read in books, but to put it to work in practice. He
knew that progress you could see was better than any proclaimed. Let
your writing this week exhibit what you have done and what you are
doing, not on what you plan to do or think you are. Let it be a cata­
log of your actions—good actions.
“Those who receive the bare theories immediately want to spew
them, as an upset stomach does its food. First digest your theories
and you won’t throw them up. Otherwise they will be raw,
spoiled, and not nourishing. After you’ve digested them, show us
the changes in your reasoned choices, just like the shoulders of
gymnasts display their diet and training, and as the craft of arti­
sans show in what they’ve learned.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.21.1-3
“First practice not letting people know who you are—keep your
philosophy to yourself for a bit. In just the manner that fruit is
produced—the seed buried for a season, hidden, growing gradu­
ally so it may come to full maturity. But if the grain sprouts before
the stalk is fully developed, it will never ripen---- That is the kind
of plant you are, displaying fruit too soon, and the winter will
kill you.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.8.35b-37

WE ARE A PRODUCT OF OUR HABITS

"T^he Roman Stoics put a heavy emphasis on dealing with habitual
I behavior in order to make progress in the art of living. The great
Roman Stoic educator Musonius Rufus held that all the theory in the
world couldn’t trump good habits (or overcome bad habits). Epictetus
followed Musonius in this focus on habit, with an eye to not reinforc­
ing bad habits—such as anger—and finding a way to replace them with
better ones. We all recognize bad habits when we see them in others,
but it’s a little harder to see them in ourselves. This week meditate on
the habits or recurring behaviors that are holding you back—even ask
someone close to you to help.
“Every habit and capability is confirmed and grows in its corre­
sponding actions, walking by walking, and running by running...
therefore, if you want to do something, make a habit of it; if you
don’t want to do that, don’t, but make a habit of something else
instead. The same principle is at work in our state of mind. When
you get angry, you’ve not only experienced that evil, but you’ve
also reinforced a bad habit, adding fuel to the fire.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.1-5

“If you don’t wish to be a hothead, don’t feed your habit. Try as a
first step to remain calm and count the days you haven’t been
angry. I used to be angry every day, now every other day, then
every third or fourth ... if you make it as far as thirty days, thank
God! For habit is first weakened and then obliterated. When you
can say ‘I didn’t lose my temper today, or the next day, or for three
or four months, but kept my cool under provocation,’ you will
know you are in better health.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.11b-14

“What assistance can we find in the fight against habit? Try the
opposite!”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.27.4

COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS

i

t’s easy to complain about the things missing in our lives, and so much
harder to appreciate how much we already have. Seneca reminded us
that everything we need to be happy is right in front of us, while the
luxuries we might be missing would themselves come at great cost—at
the cost of what we already have. Marcus agreed, and reminded him­
self to count those blessings present in our lives and to imagine what it
would be like to not have them (and how much we would miss them).
List your blessings this week, take conscious note of what you are for­
tunate to have and enjoy, so you can see clearly, as Epictetus put it,
where they came from and feel a sense of gratitude for that.
“Don’t set your mind on things you don’t possess as if they were
yours, but count the blessings you actually possess and think how
much you would desire them if they weren’t already yours. But
watch yourself, that you don’t value these things to the point of
being troubled if you should lose them.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.27
“The founder of the universe, who assigned to us the laws of life,
provided that we should live well, but not in luxury. Everything
needed for our well-being is right before us, whereas what luxury
requires is gathered by many miseries and anxieties. Let us use
this gift of nature and count it among the greatest things.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 119.15b
“It is easy to praise providence for anything that may happen if you
have two qualities: a complete view of what has actually hap­
pened in each instance and a sense of gratitude. Without gratitude
what is the point of seeing, and without seeing what is the object
of gratitude?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.6.1-2

PRACTICE TRUE JOY

"T"he Stoics held joy (chara) to be one of the good passions, worthy of
I practice in everyday life. But Stoic joy isn’t about the delights of
the senses or material pleasure. To Marcus, joy was being kind to oth­
ers. To Seneca, it was freedom from fear of suffering and death. Let’s
laugh with Democritus, as Seneca says, and engage in our “proper
human work” with joy. Consider in your writing this week where you
might find joy and what good you might do with it.
“Joy for human beings lies in proper human work. And proper
human work consists in: acts of kindness to other human beings,
disdain for the stirrings of the senses, identifying trustworthy
impressions, and contemplating the natural order and all that
happens in keeping with it.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.26

“Trust me, real joy is a serious thing. Do you think someone can,
in the charming expression, blithely dismiss death with an easy
disposition? Or swing open the door to poverty, keep pleasures
in check, or meditate on the endurance of suffering? The one who
is comfortable with turning these thoughts over is truly full of joy,
but hardly cheerful. It’s exactly such a joy that I would wish for
you to possess, for it will never run dry once you’ve laid claim to
its source.”
—Seneca, Moral LETTERSy 23.4

“Heraclitus would shed tears whenever he went out in public—
Democritus laughed. One saw the whole as a parade of miseries,
the other of follies. And so, we should take a lighter view of things
and bear them with an easy spirit, for it is more human to laugh
at life than to lament it.”
—Seneca, On Tranquility OFMiNDy 15.2

THE VIEW FROM ABOVE

"T"he way to escape petty concerns and worries of daily existence
I requires taking some time out and getting what Stoics like to call
“the view from above.” This was something Marcus Aurelius reminded
himself to do regularly. He had learned from Heraclitus that everything
in the world was constantly changing and that remembering this can
eliminate so many stresses and concerns. This week don’t just look at
what you’re dealing with in your life up close; try to see it from far
away, too. Try to describe what another, larger perspective would look
like—of your problems, of your worries, of your obsessions.
“How beautifully Plato put it. Whenever you want to talk about
people, it’s best to take a bird’s-eye view and see everything all at
once—of gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births
and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign peo­
ple, holidays, memorials, markets—all blended together and
arranged in a pairing of opposites.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.48
“Watch the stars in their courses and imagine yourself running
alongside them. Think constantly on the changes of the elements
into each other, for such thoughts wash away the dust of earthly
life.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.47
“The cosmic order—the same for everyone—wasn’t made by any
god or human, but always was and always will be. An eternal fire,
kindled in measures, and extinguished in measures.”
—Heraclitus (as quoted by Clement of Alexandria)

ROLE MODELS

A doption was a widespread practice in Roman society, especially in
#\the senatorial class and as a provision for imperial succession.
Marcus Aurelius himself was the adopted son of Emperor Antoninus
Pius, who himself was adopted by the Emperor Hadrian so that Mar­
cus would one day succeed them both to the purple. While Seneca was
never adopted, his brother Novatus was, becoming Gallio who in the
New Testament refused to press charges on Saint Paul. But Seneca liked
to look at the phenomenon of adoption the other way around, saying
we can always choose whose children we want to be. For him, Cato,
the towering, resolute Stoic who railed against Julius Caesar in defense
of the Republic, was always standing by in his mind. The first book in
Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is a catalog of all the people he had
learned from and the lessons he had taken from their lives. Use this
week to think of models that you can follow, wise and admirable peo­
ple you can measure yourself against.
“We like to say that we don’t get to choose our parents, that they
were given by chance—yet we can truly choose whose children
we’d like to be.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 15.3a

“We can remove most sins if we have a witness standing by as we
are about to go wrong. The soul should have someone it can
respect, by whose example it can make its inner sanctum more
inviolable. Happy is the person who can improve others, not only
when present, but even when in their thoughts!”

TRY THE OTHER HANDLE

IJ^ pictetus offered a powerful tool in his handbook, the Enchiridion,
t. which Stoics use as an exercise in decision-making about difficult
events. Everything, Epictetus said, has two interpretations, or handles
by which they can be grabbed: one that will make it harder, one that
will make it easier. Do you take offense? Or do you focus on common
ground? Do you focus on all that has gone wrong? Or what has gone
right? Ask yourself these questions about everything you see and feel
this week. Make sure you are using the right handle.

i

“Every event has two handles—one by which it can be carried, and
one by which it can’t. If your brother does you wrong, don’t grab
it by his wronging, because this is the handle incapable of lifting
it. Instead, use the other—that he is your brother, that you were
raised together, and then you will have hold of the handle that
carries.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 43
“No, it is events that give rise to fear—when another has power over
them or can prevent them, that person becomes able to inspire
fear. How is the fortress destroyed? Not by iron or fire, but by
judgments . . . here is where we must begin, and it is from this
front that we must seize the fortress and throw out the tyrants.”

TAKE A WALK

Q eneca believed we should take frequent wandering walks, because
w constant work will fracture our minds. (As a writer he must have
agreed with the novelist Helen Dunmore, “A problem with a piece of
writing often clarifies itself if you go for a long walk.”) Take some good
walks this week and watch the dullness and feebleness depart. Enjoy
the scenery, enjoy being away from your work. Make them part of your
morning and evening writing routine. Return with a stimulated mind
that’s ready to journal about and follow the philosophy you know. You
think that it’s taking a “break,” but really you end up smarter and
clearer than you were when you left.
“We should take wandering outdoor walks, so that the mind might
be nourished and refreshed by the open air and deep breathing.”
—Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 17.8

“Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and
come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive
might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to
the tree that gave it growth.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.48.2

“The mind must be given relaxation—it will rise improved and
sharper after a good break. Just as rich fields must not be forced—
for they will quickly lose their fertility if never given a break—so
constant work on the anvil will fracture the force of the mind. But
it regains its powers if it is set free and relaxed for a while. Con­
stant work gives rise to a certain kind of dullness and feebleness
in the rational soul.”
—Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 17.5

WHAT’S IN YOUR WAY IS THE WAY

bstacles are a fact of life. Even the most powerful and lucky of us
are not exempt from this reality, but we have a superpower at our
hands through Stoic philosophy in that our purposes, intentions, and
attitudes can adapt to any conditions to find a way forward. The Stoics
had a word for this, hupexhairesis, meaning acting with a kind of
“reserve-clause” or “reverse-clause” that allows us to reconsider and
set a new course of action as needed. Marcus Aurelius tells us that any
obstacle can actually become the raw material for a new purpose! How
might the obstacles you’re facing reveal a new path?
“While it’s true that someone can impede our actions, they can’t
impede our intentions and our attitudes, which have the power of
being conditional and adaptable. For the mind adapts and con­
verts any obstacle to its action into a means of achieving it. That
which is an impediment to action is turned to advance action. The
obstacle on the path becomes the way.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.20
“. . . just as nature turns to its own purpose any obstacle or any
opposition, sets its place in the destined order, and co-opts it, so
every rational person can convert any obstacle into the raw mate­
rial for their own purpose.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.35
“You must build up your life action by action, and be content if
each one achieves its goal as far as possible—and no one can keep
you from this. But there will be some external obstacle! Perhaps,
but no obstacle to acting with justice, self-control, and wisdom.
But what if some other area of my action is thwarted? Well, gladly
accept the obstacle for what it is and shift your attention to what
is given, and another action will immediately take its place, one
that better fits the life you are building.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.32

PROTECT YOUR OWN GOOD

M

usonius Rufus, one of Epictetus’s teachers, taught that human
beings are all born with an innate goodness, or, as he put it, with
an inclination to virtue. It’s our choices that decide whether that good­
ness comes out or not. We’re not bad people, essentially, though we
might sometimes do bad things. The purpose of Stoicism then is to
remind us of that goodness and to help us work hard to protect it.
Spend some time writing about the choices you can make this week—
the actions you can take—to do just that.
“Protect your own good in all that you do, and as concerns every­
thing else take what is given as far as you can make reasoned use
of it. If you don’t, you’ll be unlucky, prone to failure, hindered,
and stymied.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.11

“Dig deep within yourself, for there is a fountain of goodness ever
ready to flow if you will keep digging.”

WEEK XXVIII
DON’T LOOK FOR THE THIRD THING

T

he Stoics teach us that doing well is its own reward. To do the
right thing, and to see someone helped by it, is enough. To go
around expecting thanks—what Marcus Aurelius described as the
“third thing”—on top of it? That’s being greedy. Keeping score not
only misses the purpose of being good, it’s foolish. It sets you up for
disappointment. If you are going to do some accounting, look at it from
the other direction. How many people have helped us—and what do
we owe them in return? Think about clearing your debts this week, and
consider forgiving any notion of others owing you.
“One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the
expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still consid­
ers the person a debtor and knows the favor. A third kind of
person acts as if not conscious of the deed, rather like a vine
producing a cluster of grapes without making further demands,
like a horse after its race, or a dog after its walk, or a bee after
making its honey. Such a person, having done a good deed, won’t
go shouting from rooftops but simply moves on to the next deed
just like the vine produces another bunch of grapes in the right
season.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.6

“When you’ve done well and another has benefited by it, why like
a fool do you look for a third thing on top—credit for the good
deed or a favor in return?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.73

PRACTICE GENTLENESS INSTEAD OF ANGER

I t’s easy to imagine Marcus Aurelius losing his temper. His responsiI bilities were vast and his job required him to work with many frus­
trating, difficult people. As such, he had an acute sense of the problem
of anger, knowing just how counterproductive it can be and how mis­
erable it can make its users. He often repeated a simple exercise designed
to preserve goodwill for others by simply replacing anger with gentle­
ness. We can’t allow ourselves to desert our goodwill, and we must
remind ourselves that no one makes a mistake willingly. Each time you
feel anger this week, remember Marcus and see how you might replace
it with gentleness—and write these examples down.
“As you move forward along the path of reason, people will stand
in your way. They will never be able to keep you from doing what’s
sound, so don’t let them knock out your goodwill for them. Keep
a steady watch on both fronts, not only for well-based judgments
and actions, but also for gentleness with those who would obstruct
our path or create other difficulties. For getting angry is also a
weakness, just as much as abandoning the task or surrendering
under panic.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.9

“As Plato said, every soul is deprived of truth against its will. The
same holds true for justice, self-control, goodwill to others, and
every similar virtue. It’s essential to constantly keep this in your
mind, for it will make you more gentle to all.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.63

“Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on—
it isn’t manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are
more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn’t give way
to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage,
and endurance....”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5b

KEEPING “THE NEWS” IN CHECK

PJJ ven the ancients felt inundated with gossip and news. This week you
L-will face a barrage like they couldn’t have imagined—from texts,
calls, e-mails to the incessant grind of the 24/7 news machine. Instead
of responding to every status update, urgent call, or the latest trending
incendiary news story, take a moment to remember three ways the
Stoics used to keep their focus on their purpose and duty in the present
moment: (1) Step away from the noise. (2) Remember that no news can
throw you off the purpose of your present choices. (3) Don’t add some­
thing negative (or positive) to what is being reported.
“Are you distracted by breaking news? Then take some leisure time
to learn something good, and stop bouncing around. But when
you do, keep in mind the other mistake, to be so distracted by
getting control that you wear yourself out and lose a purpose by
which you can direct your impulses and thoughts.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.7
“Whenever disturbing news is delivered to you, bear in mind that
no news can ever be relevant to your reasoned choice. Can any­
one break news to you that your assumptions or desires are
wrong? No way! But they can tell you someone died—even so,
what is that to you?”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.18.1-2
“Don’t tell yourself anything more than what the initial impres­
sions report. It’s been reported to you that someone is speaking
badly about you. This is the report—the report wasn’t that you’ve
been harmed. I see that my son is sick—but not that his life is at
risk. So always stay within your first impressions, and don’t add
to them in your head—this way nothing can happen to you.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.49

A WEEK WITHOUT COMPLAINING

□ pictetus spoke often to his students about the need to give up blamE— ing and complaining—in fact, he saw it as one of the primary mea­
suring sticks of progress in the art of living. How much of life is wasted
pointing fingers? Has complaining ever solved a single problem? Mar­
cus Aurelius would say, “Blame yourself—or no one.” This week, try
constructive feedback over complaining and responsibility over blame.
And if something goes wrong, spend some time reflecting on what the
true causes were. Don’t waste a minute with complaints—in this jour­
nal or out loud.
“You must stop blaming God, and not blame any person. You must
completely control your desire and shift your avoidance to what
lies within your reasoned choice. You must no longer feel anger,
resentment, envy, or regret.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.22.13

“For nothing outside my reasoned choice can hinder or harm it—
my reasoned choice alone can do this to itself. If we would lean
this way whenever we fail, and would blame only ourselves and
remember that nothing but opinion is the cause of a troubled
mind and uneasiness, then by God, I swear we would be making
progress.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.19.2-3

“But if you deem as your own only what is yours, and what belongs
to others as truly not yours, then no one will ever be able to coerce
or to stop you, you will find no one to blame or accuse, you will
do nothing against your will, you will have no enemy, no one will
harm you, because no harm can affect you.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 1.3

WHAT LITTLE WINS CAN YOU FIND?

"yTeno of Citium, the Phoenician merchant who founded the Stoic
^-school on the painted porch (stoa poikile) of the Agora after a
shipwreck, said that happiness was a matter of small steps. While the
Stoics believed in the perfectibility of human beings, they knew much
stood in the way of realizing that potential. So they would be skeptical
of the so-called epic wins and quantum leaps that our culture obsesses
over today. Instead, they would urge you to focus on your daily duties,
on making incremental progress. Spend your writing time this week
thinking about the small wins you can rack up, what little gains can be
had from this improvement or that one, a decision here or a decision
there. Be satisfied with each small step. Keep moving and don’t give up.
“Do now what nature demands of you. Get right to it if that’s in
your power. Don’t look around to see if people will know about
it. Don’t await the perfection of Plato’s Republic, but be satisfied
with even the smallest step forward and regard the outcome as a
small thing.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.29
“We don’t abandon our pursuits because we despair of ever per­
fecting them.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.2.37b
“Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing.”
—Zeno, Quoted in Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.26

ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION

uch of what we do and say during the course of a week is completely
i I unnecessary. Meetings, material possessions, confrontations,
pursuits—pointless distractions and problems. They take us away
from tranquility and purpose. A Stoic cuts through these temptations
and obligations by asking this question, a question that you should lead
your journaling with this week. Try it. Before speaking, acting, or
buying something, ask simply: “Is this one of the necessary things?”
“It is said that if you would have peace of mind, busy yourself with
little. But wouldn’t a better saying be do what you must and as
required of a rational being created for public life? For this brings
not only the peace of mind of doing few things, but the greater
peace of doing them well. Since the vast majority of our words
and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abun­
dance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn’t forget
at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things? But
we must corral not only unnecessary actions but unnecessary
thoughts, too, so needless acts don’t tag along after them.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.24

“I was shipwrecked before I even boarded ... the journey showed
me this—how much of what we have is unnecessary, and how
easily we can decide to rid ourselves of these things whenever it’s
necessary, never suffering the loss.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 87.1

WEEK XXXIV
JUST SAY NO TO FUTURE MISERY

.
;

II ow often we make ourselves miserable ... in advance. Out of fear
I I of this, out of desperate hope for that. When we focus on pining
for or avoiding a certain future, we make ourselves miserable here in
the present. Hecato of Rhodes, the great student of the great middleStoic scholar Panaetius, taught that this misery is always tied to hopes
or fears we give to imagined future outcomes. From this Seneca reminds
us this week to say no to both, because indulging them robs us of the
ability to enjoy the present. As you write, don’t think about the future—
what you hope will happen, what you fear might—just focus on right
now. What you’re doing and thinking right now.

i

'
!

“It’s ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and mis­
erable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things
it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul
will never be at rest—by longing for things to come it will lose the
ability to enjoy present things.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 98.5b-6a

“But there is no reason to live and no limit to our miseries if we let
our fears predominate.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 13.12b

“Hecato says, ‘Cease to hope and you will cease to fear.’. . . The
primary cause of both these ills is that instead of adapting our­
selves to present circumstances we send out thoughts too far
ahead.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 5.7b-8

A CURE FOR PROCRASTINATION

"T"o the Stoic, procrastination almost looks like a form of delusion
I and entitlement. Who is to say you’ll even be around next month
or next week to deal with it? If it’s important, they’d say, don’t wait.
Do it now. As Marcus says, if it needs to be done, do it with “courage
and promptness.” Procrastination seems like it makes things easier, but
it damns us to a low-grade, gnawing state of anxiety. Is that how you’d
want to spend this week? Any week? Your last week? Ask yourself:
What am I avoiding? What can I handle today instead of tomorrow?
What can I do promptly and bravely, right now?
“Anything that must yet be done, virtue can do with courage and
promptness. For anyone would call it a sign of foolishness for one
to undertake a task with a lazy and begrudging spirit, or to push
the body in one direction and the mind in another, to be torn
apart by wildly divergent impulses.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 31.B-32
“This is the mark of perfection of character—to spend each day as
if it were your last, without frenzy, laziness, or any pretending.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.69
“You get what you deserve. Instead of being a good person today,
you choose instead to become one tomorrow.”

A HARD WINTER TRAINING

^The art of living has three levels of discipline: study, practice, and
I hard training. Reading the Stoics, that’s study. Trying out the
lessons and reflecting on them in this journal, that’s practice. What’s
left is the hard training. Epictetus liked to use the analogy of the Roman
army’s practice of training hard in the off months of winter so they
would be prepared to meet any challenge when they returned to battle
in the spring. Seneca would spend time each month exposing himself
to tougher than usual conditions. He, too, used a military analogy,
pointing to the way soldiers are tasked with hard jobs so they would
be strong when the enemy eventually came. What are you doing this
week to push yourself beyond mere study and practice?
“We must undergo a hard winter training and not rush into things
for which we haven’t prepared.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.2.32
“Here’s a lesson to test your mind’s mettle: take part of a week in
which you have only the most meager and cheap food, dress
scantly in shabby clothes, and ask yourself if this is really the
worst that you feared. It is when times are good that you should
gird yourself for tougher times ahead, for when Fortune is kind
the soul can build defenses against her ravages. So it is that sol­
diers practice maneuvers in peacetime, erecting bunkers with no
enemies in sight and exhausting themselves under no attack so
that when it comes they won’t grow tired.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 18.5-6
“When a challenge confronts you, remember that God is matching
you with a younger sparring partner, as would a physical trainer.
Why? Becoming an Olympian takes sweat! I think no one has a
better challenge than yours, if only you would use it like an ath­
lete would that younger sparring partner.”

A NEW WAY TO PRAY

\ A Ae often pray for the things we desire and, in the process, excuse
V V ourselves from the equation. We’re hoping the heavens will mag­
ically gift us with the outcome we want—whether it’s for a promotion
or the speedy recovery of a loved one. The Stoics would urge you to
stop doing this. Marcus Aurelius reminded himself not to present the
gods with a list of demands for pleasures or comforts, but instead to
ask for help not needing those things. In a sense then, he was really
asking for inner strength. He was asking himself. Think about all the
things you want—that you’re praying or hoping for this week—and try
turning them around like that. See what you come up with instead.
“Try praying differently, and see what happens: Instead of asking
for ‘a way to sleep with her,’ try asking for ‘a way to stop desiring
to sleep with her.’ Instead of ‘a way to get rid of him,’ try asking for
‘a way to not crave his demise.’ Instead of ‘a way to not lose my
child,’ try asking for ‘a way to lose my fear of it.’”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.40.(6)

“We cry to God Almighty, how can we escape this agony? Fool,
don’t you have hands? Or could it be God forgot to give you a
pair? Sit and pray your nose doesn’t run! Or rather just wipe your
nose and stop seeking a scapegoat.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.16.13

“But I haven’t at any time been hindered in my will, nor forced
against it. And how is this possible? I have bound up my choice
to act with the will of God. God wills that I be sick, such is my
will. He wills that I should choose something, so do I. He wills
that I reach for something, or something be given to me—I wish
for the same. What God doesn’t will, I do not wish for.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.1.89

WEEK XXXVIII
ON HANDLING HATERS

■T"he Stoics taught that kindness trumps hate. They believed that
I those who engage in hate are prisoners to a destructive passion—
one that hurts the practitioner, not the intended target. There’s no
reason to hate a hater; they are already suffering enough. In fact, when
you see them this way, it makes it easier to be kind, good-natured,
genuine, and useful. Remember the line in the Bible about how loving
your enemies is like pouring hot coals on them, because it’s so unex­
pected? Who can you surprise like that this week? Whose enmity can
you meet with kindness and compassion? How much better do you feel
having done so?
“What if someone despises me? Let them see to it. But I will see to
it that I won’t be found doing or saying anything contemptible.
What if someone hates me? Let them see to that. But I will see to
it that I’m kind and good-natured to all, and prepared to show
even the hater where they went wrong. Not in a critical way, or
to show off my patience, but genuinely and usefully.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.13
“Kindness is invincible, but only when it’s sincere, with no hypoc­
risy or faking. For what can even the most malicious person do if
you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently
point out where they went wrong—right as they are trying to
harm you?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5.9a
“Keep in mind that it isn’t the one who has it in for you and takes
a swipe that harms you, but rather the harm comes from your
own belief about the abuse. So when someone arouses your anger,
know that it’s really your own opinion fueling it. Instead, make
it your first response not to be carried away by such impressions,
for with time and distance self-mastery is more easily achieved.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 20

PANIC IS SELF-INFLICTED HARM
I

K I ame one situation that is improved by panicking. Go ahead—
I X write it down if you’ve got one! Seneca mused often about the
problem of panic both in his letters and essays. It creates danger and
limits our ability to function effectively. It prevents us from finding
success and seeing objectively. Worse, it makes us weaker over time
because we’ve never truly faced the danger we are so worried about.
Meditate on the scary things that might make you panic. Think about
what is so overwhelming about them. Come to understand them. Get
familiar with them.
“For even peace itself will supply more reason for worry. Not even
safe circumstances will bring you confidence once your mind has
been shocked—once it gets in the habit of blind panic, it can’t
provide for its own safety. For it doesn’t really avoid danger, it just
runs away. Yet we are exposed to greater danger with our backs
turned.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 104.10b
“Success comes to the lowly and to the poorly talented, but the
special characteristic of a great person is to triumph over the
disasters and panics of human life.”
—Seneca, On Providence, 4.1
“The unprepared are panic-stricken by the smallest things.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 107.4

PRACTICE SILENCE

Q ocial media teaches us to have an opinion about everything. Silence
w beckons us to speak. We live in a loud culture and we try to keep up
by being louder in return. How much trouble does that cause us? How
much might we learn if we spent more time listening to others than we
do trying to sandwich our opinions in at every turn? How much of
what we say have we come to regret? The truly loud thing to say is
nothing. Write your thoughts down here this week, but see how many
of them you can keep to yourself. Be bold in your silence, in how much
you hold your tongue this week.
“Better to trip with the feet than with the tongue.”
—Zeno, Quoted in Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.26
“To the youngster talking nonsense Zeno said, ‘The reason why
we have two ears and only one mouth is so we might listen more
and talk less.’”
—Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.23
“Cato practiced the kind of public speech capable of moving the
masses, believing proper political philosophy takes care like any
great city to maintain the warlike element. But he was never seen
practicing in front of others, and no one ever heard him rehearse
a speech. When he was told that people blamed him for his silence,
he replied, ‘Better they not blame my life. I begin to speak only
when I’m certain what I’ll say isn’t better left unsaid.*”
—Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 4
“Silence is a lesson learned from the many sufferings of life.”

PRACTICE LOVE

The Stoic notion of sympatheia, that we all are part of an organic
I whole, connected by mutual interests and affinities, is greater than
the Golden Rule. Don’t treat others how you would like to be treated,
treat them like you treat yourself, because we are all one. Seneca said
that whenever he encountered another human being he saw an opportu­
nity for kindness. He had learned from Hecato that if you want to be
loved there is only one thing to do: love others. Who can you give love
to this week? What kindness can you expend? How can you show how
you feel—strangers, friends, and family? How can you show them that
you believe we are all part of the same whole?
“Hecato says, T can teach you a love potion made without any
drugs, herbs, or special spell—if you would be loved, love.’”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 9.6
“A benefit should be kept like a buried treasure, only to be dug up
in necessity. . . . Nature bids us to do well by all. . . . Wherever
there is a human being, we have an opportunity for kindness.”
—Seneca, On the Happy Life, 24.2-3
“Nature produced us as a family, since we all sprang from the same
source and toward the same end. Nature bestowed upon us
mutual love, and joined us together as friends.”

MAKE HONESTY YOUR ONLY POLICY

A s emperor, Marcus Aurelius did not see the best of humanity. At
/ \court there would have been backbiting, people who sold their
friends out when they saw an opportunity to advance themselves, ava­
rice, and deceit. But he especially didn’t like faux attempts at honesty.
His point: if you have to say “I’m going to be honest with you here,”
you’re casually saying that honesty is the exception and not the rule.
How sad is that? It’s time to think about what those little statements
say about us—and make sure that our default policy is honesty and
straightforwardness.
“How rotten and fraudulent when people say they intend to give it
to you straight. What are you up to, dear friend? It shouldn’t need
your announcement, but be readily seen, as if written on your
forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes—just
as the beloved sees it all in the lover’s glance. In short, the straight­
forward and good person should be like a smelly goat—you know
when they are in the room with you. A calculated ‘giving it to
you straight’ is like a dagger. There’s nothing worse than a wolf
befriending sheep. Avoid false friendship at all costs. If you are
good, straightforward, and well-meaning it should show in your
eyes and not escape notice.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.15
“It’s in keeping with Nature to show our friends affection and to
celebrate their advancement, as if it were our very own. For if we
don’t do this, virtue, which is strengthened only by exercising our
perceptions, will no longer endure in us.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 109.15

BUILD UP, DON’T TEAR DOWN

i

I

s there a worse environment to work in than one where bullying and
one-upmanship is the norm? Sometimes leaders seem to think that
that is part of the job description—that they are there to regulate and
keep people in line. In truth, tearing people down is incredibly coun­
terproductive. Pete Carroll, coach of the Seattle Seahawks, poses a
question: If self-confidence is so important for players, why would a
coach ever do anything to damage it? Marcus Aurelius, who had the
power to take down anyone at will, almost never did. Instead, he
reminded himself that it was better to build up—be community-minded,
modest, prepared, and tolerant of others. We are made for cooperation
(synergia) and to render works held in common (praxeis koinonikas
apodidonai). Let’s think about that going forward: How can we help
build the self-confidence of others? How can we find some of our own
in doing so?
“So someone’s good at taking down an opponent, but that doesn’t
make them more community-minded, or modest, or well-prepared
for any circumstance, or more tolerant of the faults of others.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.52
“Whenever you have trouble getting up in the morning, remind
yourself that you’ve been made by nature for the purpose of work­
ing with others___And it’s our own natural purpose that is more
fitting and more satisfying.”

ACCEPTING WHAT IS

Q einhold Niebuhr’s Serenity Prayer is a mantra for many: “God
Ivgrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage
to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.” The
Stoics wanted to push past simply “accepting” what is—they wanted
to be grateful and happy with what it is. Epictetus taught that we get
a well-flowing life when we wish for what is going to happen not what
we want to happen, and Marcus added that we should meet anything
that comes our way with gratitude. Not “I wish this was different, but
I’ll tolerate it”; instead “I am glad it happened this way. It is for the
best.” Try that on for size this week.
“Don’t seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but
rather wish that everything happens as it actually will—then your
life will flow well.”
—Epictetus, Enchiridion, 8

“To be truly educated means this—learning to wish that each thing
happens exactly as it does.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 1.12.15

“All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present
moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and
an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that

THE REAL POWER YOU HAVE

"There is fleeting power and there is real power. Fleeting power can
I be taken away, while real power is in our minds and our bones.
The former tends to be along the lines of wealth, fame, high position,
and the leverage all those things give us over others. The Stoics thought
this kind of power was inferior to the real power that each person
possesses—the power of our minds to reason and make judgments and
choices based on the real worth of things. You can have both kinds of
power, too, but only if you keep the first kind of power subject to the
kind of power the Stoics cared about.
“This is the very thing which makes up the virtue of the happy
person and a well-flowing life—when the affairs of life are in
every way tuned to the harmony between the individual divine
spirit and the will of the director of the universe.”
—Chrysippus, Quoted in Diogenes Laertius,
Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, 7.1.88
“Don’t trust in your reputation, money, or position, but in the
strength that is yours—namely, your judgments about the things
that you control and don’t control. For this alone is what makes
us free and unfettered, that picks us up by the neck from the
depths and lifts us eye to eye with the rich and powerful.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.26.34-35
“Understand at last that you have something in you more powerful
and divine than what causes the bodily passions and pulls you like
a mere puppet. What thoughts now occupy my mind? Is it not
fear, suspicion, desire, or something like that?”

JUDGE YOURSELF, NOT OTHERS

"inhere is nothing less philosophical than being a know-it-all. This is
I especially true of those who use their knowledge to scold others
for their mistakes while proclaiming the superiority of their knowledge
or insight. The Stoics taught that behaving this way was to miss the
entire purpose of philosophy—as a tool for self-correction, medicine
for our own souls, not a weapon for putting others down. Seneca’s
letters twice employ the metaphor of scrubbing down or scraping off
our faults. We need to see ourselves as “in the care of philosophy’s
principles,” or, as Epictetus put it later when referring to the philoso­
pher’s lecture hall, we need to see it as a hospital for our own therapy.
Don’t let yourself write down a single complaint or problem of another
person in this journal this week—focus on what ails you.
“When philosophy is wielded with arrogance and stubbornly, it is
the cause for the ruin of many. Let philosophy scrape off your own
faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 103.4b-5a

“Some people with exceptional minds quickly grasp virtue or pro­
duce it within themselves. But other dim and lazy types, hindered
by bad habits, must have their rusty souls constantly scrubbed
down. . . . The weaker sorts will be helped and lifted from their
bad opinions if we put them in the care of philosophy’s princi­
ples.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 95.36-37

“Men, the philosopher’s lecture-hall is a hospital—you shouldn’t
walk out of it feeling pleasure, but pain, for you aren’t well when
you enter it.”

PRACTICE LETTING GO

\ A/e suffer when we lose things we love, and we suffer most when
Y Y we lose people we love—a natural and unavoidable part of life.
The Stoics say this suffering is increased by our belief that we possess
the objects of our love—that they are, as we like to say, “a part of us.”
This belief doesn’t increase our love and care for them, but rather is a
form of clinging that ignores the simple fact that we don’t control what
will happen, not to our own bodies, let alone to the ones we love. Epic­
tetus taught a powerful exercise that every time you wish a dear child,
family member, or friend good night, remember that these people are
like a precious breakable glass, and remember how dramatically things
could change while you sleep. Marcus, too, struggled to practice this
with his own family as he tucked them in at night. The point isn’t to be
morbid but to create a sense of appreciation and a kind of humility.
Don’t take anyone—especially someone you love—for granted this week.
“Whenever you experience the pangs of losing something, don’t
treat it like a part of yourself but as a breakable glass, so when it
falls you will remember that and won’t be troubled. So, too,
whenever you kiss your child, sibling, or friend, don’t layer on top
of the experience all the things you might wish, but hold them
back and stop them, just as those who ride behind triumphant
generals remind them they are mortal. In the same way, remind
yourself that your precious one isn’t one of your possessions, but
something given for now, not forever.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24.84-86a
“But the wise person can lose nothing. Such a person has every­
thing stored up for themselves, leaving nothing to Fortune, their
own goods are held firm, bound in virtue, which requires nothing
from chance, and therefore can’t be either increased or dimin­
ished.”

BALANCE THE BOOKS OF LIFE DAILY

\ A Ae journal as a way of gathering up life’s experiences, insights,
▼ Y frustrations, unexpected struggles and triumphs, and more. In
all of this we are making a reckoning of our progress on life’s way.
Seneca, whose father-in-law was in charge of keeping the books on
Rome’s granary, liked the metaphor of balancing life’s books each day.
Rather than postpone, our impulse each day should be to bring things,
as much as possible, to completion. Why? Because we never know what
tomorrow might bring. Epictetus, too, would tell his students that the
important thing was that they had begun: begun to practice, learn, get
better. Give yourself credit this week for the journey you are on—and
reflect on how far you have come (and how far there is left to go).
“Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life.
Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day.
Life’s greatest flaw is that it’s always imperfect, and a certain
portion of it is postponed. The one who puts the finishing touches
on their life each day is never short of time.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 101.7b-8a

“Believe me, it’s better to produce the balance-sheet of your own
life than that of the grain market.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 18.3b

“I am your teacher and you are learning in my school. My aim is
to bring you to completion, unhindered, free from compulsive
behavior, unrestrained, without shame, free, flourishing, and
happy, looking to God in things great and small—your aim is to
learn and diligently practice all these things. Why then don’t you
complete the work, if you have the right aim and I have both the
right aim and right preparation? What is missing?... The work
is quite feasible, and is the only thing in our power-----Let go of
the past. We must only begin. Believe me and you will see.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 2.19.29-34

WEEK XLIX
BE STINGY WITH TIME

o

ne of the most common sayings we hear is “life is short.” It is—
but as Seneca remarked, it’s also plenty long if you know how to
use it. The first step to that? Not giving so much of it away to other
people. Becoming miserly about our time is a powerful exercise, which
can keep us from squandering this nonrenewable resource. What in
your life consumes a lot of time for no good purpose? What amuse­
ments and desires consume our time without giving us any good return?
As you review that list, make a commitment to doing something about
it. Life is short, after all; you don’t have too much to spare.
“Were all the geniuses of history to focus on this single theme, they
could never fully express their bafflement at the darkness of the
human mind. No person would give up even an inch of their
estate, and the slightest dispute with a neighbor can mean hell to
pay; yet we easily let others encroach on our lives—worse, we
often pave the way for those who will take it over. No person
hands out their money to passersby, but to how many do each of
us hand out our lives! We’re tight-fisted with property and money,
yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we
should all be the toughest misers.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 3.1-2
“It’s not at all that we have too short a time to live, but that we
squander a great deal of it. Life is long enough, and it’s given in
sufficient measure to do many great things if we spend it well. But
when it’s poured down the drain of luxury and neglect, when it’s
employed to no good end, we’re finally driven to see that it has
passed by before we even recognized it passing. And so it is—we
don’t receive a short life, we make it so.”
—Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 1.3-4a

KEEP THE RHYTHM

arcus Aurelius must have known that as emperor he was part of a
I I grand and great history. As a philosopher, he also knew that all
people are part of a rhythm pulsing through both history and their own
lives, and he liked to remind himself to not lose that beat. Return to
your philosophy, he would tell himself when he drifted. Don’t give in to
the distractions. In fact, he tried constantly to return to it. That kind of
awareness (prosoche, paying special attention) is something he learned
from reading Epictetus, who told his students that while none of us can
be perfect, we can catch ourselves when we begin to slide, when we drift
from where we should be. Can you feel that rhythm this week? Can you
point to examples of when you really felt locked into it?
“Walk the long gallery of the past, of empires and kingdoms suc­
ceeding each other without number. And you can also see the
future, for surely it will be exactly the same, unable to deviate
from the present rhythm. It’s all one whether we’ve experienced
forty years or an aeon. What more is there to see?”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 7.49

“When forced, as it seems, by circumstances into utter confusion,
get a hold of yourself quickly. Don’t be locked out of the rhythm
any longer than necessary. You’ll be able to keep the beat if you
are constantly returning to it.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.11

“When you let your attention slide for a bit, don’t think you will
get back a grip on it whenever you wish—instead, bear in mind
that because of today’s mistake everything that follows will be
necessarily worse.... Is it possible to be free from error? Not by
any means, but it is possible to be a person always stretching to
avoid error. For we must be content to at least escape a few mis­
takes by never letting our attention slide.”
—Epictetus, Discourses, 4.12.1; 19

STAKE YOUR CLAIM

w

e like to collect the sayings of great writers or of leaders we
admire—they often become mantras for us on the path of life,
providing guidance and assurance. But as Seneca reminds us, truth
hasn’t been monopolized. We need to spend some time and effort each
week formulating our own wisdom, staking our own claims based on
our study, practice, and training. That’s what this journal is about.
Reflecting on the Stoic wisdom and adding our own to it. Seneca urged
us to blaze our own trail and to take charge and stake our own claim.
Well, let’s do it. Let these pages reflect the insights you have learned by
your own experiences. Let the inspiration you’ve taken from the Stoics
create your own exercises, reminders, and perspectives.
“For it’s disgraceful for an old person, or one in sight of old age, to
have only the knowledge carried in their notebooks. Zeno said
this... what do you say? Cleanthes said that... what do you say?
How long will you be compelled by the claims of another? Take
charge and stake your own claim—something posterity will carry
in its notebook.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 33.7
“Won’t you be walking in your predecessors’ footsteps? I surely
will use the older path, but if I find a shorter and smoother way,
I’ll blaze a trail there. The ones who pioneered these paths aren’t
our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone, it
hasn’t been monopolized.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 33.11
“Don’t act grudgingly, selfishly, without due diligence, or to be a
contrarian. Don’t overdress your thought in fine language. Don’t
be a person of too many words and too many deeds---- Be cheer­
ful, not wanting outside help or the relief others might bring. A
person needs to stand on their own, not be propped up.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 3

TURN WORDS INTO WORKS

arcus spent a great deal of time on his journals, yet within their
I I pages we find him admonishing himself to throw them away, to
never read their pages. Why? Because he didn’t want them to be an
excuse from the essential tasks at hand. The art of living will never be
found anywhere but in our own efforts to be a good person. Never
forget that is the aim of this journal. It is not to fill up pages with pretty
thoughts but to inspire you to take action, to turn the words, as Seneca
said, into works. In that we have the perfect place to end this year, with
the ultimate Stoic prompt: Get active in your own rescue.
“Stop wandering about! You aren’t likely to read your own note­
books, or ancient histories, or the anthologies you’ve collected to
enjoy in your old age. Get busy with life’s purpose, toss aside
empty hopes, get active in your own rescue—if you care for your­
self at all—and do it while you can.”
—marcus aurelius, Meditations, 3.14
“You have proof in the extent of your wanderings that you never
found the art of living anywhere—not in logic, nor in wealth,
fame, or in any indulgence. Nowhere. Where is it then? In doing
what human nature demands. How is a person to do this? By
having principles be the source of desire and action. What prin­
ciples? Those to do with good and evil, indeed in the belief that
there is no good for a human being except what creates justice,
self-control, courage, and freedom, and nothing evil except what
destroys these things.”
—MARCUS AURELIUS, Meditations, 8.1.(5)
“All study of philosophy and reading should be for the purpose of
living a happy life ... we should seek precepts to help us, noble
and courageous words that can become facts... we should learn
them in a way that words become works.”
—Seneca, Moral Letters, 108.35

\ A /hile this journal was designed to be the ultimate companion for
Y Y The Daily Stoic, and The Daily Stoic was designed to be read as
many times as a reader would like, you might well be looking for even
more prompts and Stoic readings, especially if this is your second go
around with the journal. That is something we are happy to provide.
First, we send out a free e-mail every single day of Stoic wisdom at
DailyStoic.com. If you haven’t signed up yet, you absolutely should!
Second, if you’re looking for some classic and modern Stoic texts to
journal along to, we have some recommendations:
• Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (we strongly recommend the
Gregory Hays translation for Modern Library)
• Letters of a Stoic by Seneca (the abridged Penguin Classics edi­
tion is wonderful and there is also a full—and free—e-book edi­
tion put out by Tim Ferriss)
• Discourses and Selected Writings by Epictetus (again, hard to do
better than Penguin Classics)
• The Inner Citadel: The Meditations ofMarcus Aurelius by Pierre
Hadot (this is a wonderful deep dive into Marcus Aurelius’s phi­
losophy and what makes him tick)
• The Moral Sayings of Publilius Syrus: A Roman Slave by Publilius
Syrus (another slave turned philosopher whose pithy epigrams
will give you something to write about each day)
If you want to learn more about Stoic exercises and practices, and
their purpose, we like the following sources:
• Chapter 3 in Pierre Hadot’s Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiri­
tual Exercises from Socrates to Foucault (Wiley-Blackwell,
1995)
• Chapters 15-16 in Richard Sorabji’s Emotion and Peace of

Acknowledgments

It takes more than an author to make a book. Allow me, therefore, to thank some of those who contributed to the realization of this work.
Thanks, to begin with, to Wright State University for
providing the professional development leave during which
the bulk of this book was written. Thanks also to my department for allowing me to teach, in the fall of 2005
2005, a course on
Hellenistic philosophy in which I was able to try out an early
version of this book.
Thanks to those who (in most cases unwittingly) played
a signiﬁcant role in my “program of voluntary discomfort,”
including Jim McCutcheon of McCutcheon Music, Debbie
Stirsman of Inner Dance Yoga Center, and my buddies at
Greater Dayton Rowing Association, with a special thanks
going to those who had the courage to row one seat behind
me: Judy Dryer, Chris Luhn, and Michael McCarty. Thanks
also to Michael for helping me explore the world of discomfort provided by the erg and for making valuable suggestions
concerning the terminology used in chapter 7.

xii Acknowledgments

Thanks to Cynthia King, who read and commented on my
manuscript. Thanks also to Bill King, who, although unwilling
to admit allegiance to the Stoic credo, has nevertheless been an
inspiration to this Stoic.
Thanks to numerous anonymous readers who helped me
sharpen the argument of this book. Thanks also to Cybele
Tom at Oxford University Press for being such a patient and
persevering literary midwife.
The biggest thanks, though, goes to my wife, Jamie, for
giving me the time and especially the space in which to write
this book.

Introduction
A Plan for Living

What do you want out of life? You might answer this question
by saying that you want a caring spouse, a good job, and a nice
house, but these are really just some of the things you want in
life. In asking what you want out of life, I am asking the question in its broadest sense. I am asking not for the goals you form
as you go about your daily activities but for your grand goal in
living. In other words, of the things in life you might pursue,
which is the thing you believe to be most valuable?
Many people will have trouble naming this goal. They
know what they want minute by minute or even decade by
decade during their life, but they have never paused to consider
their grand goal in living. It is perhaps understandable that
they haven’t. Our culture doesn’t encourage people to think
about such things; indeed, it provides them with an endless
stream of distractions so they won’t ever have to. But a grand
goal in living is the ﬁrst component of a philosophy of life.
This means that if you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a
coherent philosophy of life.
Why is it important to have such a philosophy? Because
without one, there is a danger that you will mislive—that

2 Introduction

despite all your activity, despite all the pleasant diversions you
might have enjoyed while alive, you will end up living a bad life.
There is, in other words, a danger that when you are on your
deathbed, you will look back and realize that you wasted your
one chance at living. Instead of spending your life pursuing
something genuinely valuable, you squandered it because you
allowed yourself to be distracted by the various baubles life
has to offer.
Suppose you can identify your grand goal in living. Suppose,
too, that you can explain why this goal is worth attaining. Even
then, there is a danger that you will mislive. In particular, if you
lack an effective strategy for attaining your goal, it is unlikely
that you will attain it. Thus, the second component of a philosophy of life is a strategy for attaining your grand goal in living.
This strategy will specify what you must do, as you go about
your daily activities, to maximize your chances of gaining the
thing in life that you take to be ultimately valuable.
If we want to take steps to avoid wasting our wealth, we can
easily ﬁnd experts to help us. Looking in the phone book, we
will ﬁnd any number of certiﬁed ﬁnancial planners. These individuals can help us clarify our ﬁnancial goals: How much, for
example, should we be saving for retirement? And having clariﬁed these goals, they can advise us on how to achieve them.
Suppose, however, that we want to take steps to avoid
wasting not our wealth but our life. We might seek an expert
to guide us: a philosopher of life. This individual would help
us think about our goals in living and about which of these
goals are in fact worth pursuing. She would remind us that

Introduction 3

because goals can come into conﬂict, we need to decide which
of our goals should take precedence when conﬂicts arise. She
will therefore help us sort through our goals and place them
into a hierarchy. The goal at the pinnacle of this hierarchy will
be what I have called our grand goal in living: It is the goal that
we should be unwilling to sacriﬁce to attain other goals. And
after helping us select this goal, a philosopher of life will help
us devise a strategy for attaining it.
The obvious place to look for a philosopher of life is in the
philosophy department of the local university. Visiting the
faculty ofﬁces there, we will ﬁnd philosophers specializing in
metaphysics, logic, politics, science, religion, and ethics. We
might also ﬁnd philosophers specializing in the philosophy of
sport, the philosophy of feminism, and even the philosophy
of philosophy. But unless we are at an unusual university, we
will ﬁnd no philosophers of life in the sense I have in mind.
It hasn’t always been this way. Many ancient Greek and
Roman philosophers, for example, not only thought philosophies of life were worth contemplating but thought the raison
d’être of philosophy was to develop them. These philosophers
typically had an interest in other areas of philosophy as well—
in logic, for example—but only because they thought pursuing
that interest would help them develop a philosophy of life.
Furthermore, these ancient philosophers did not keep their
discoveries to themselves or share them only with their fellow
philosophers. Rather, they formed schools and welcomed as
their pupils anyone wishing to acquire a philosophy of life.
Different schools offered different advice on what people must
do in order to have a good life. Antisthenes, a pupil of Socrates,

founded the Cynic school of philosophy, which advocated an
ascetic lifestyle. Aristippus, another pupil of Socrates, founded
the Cyrenaic school, which advocated a hedonistic lifestyle. In
between these extremes, we ﬁnd, among many other schools,
the Epicurean school, the Skeptic school, and, of most interest
to us here, the Stoic school, founded by Zeno of Citium.
The philosophers associated with these schools were
unapologetic about their interest in philosophies of life.
According to Epicurus, for example, “Vain is the word of a
philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man. For just
as there is no proﬁt in medicine if it does not expel the diseases
of the body, so there is no proﬁt in philosophy either, if it does
not expel the suffering of the mind.”1 And according to the
Stoic philosopher Seneca, about whom I will have much to
say in this book, “He who studies with a philosopher should
take away with him some one good thing every day: he should
daily return home a sounder man, or on the way to become
sounder.”2
This book is written for those seeking a philosophy of life. In
the pages that follow, I focus my attention on a philosophy that
I have found useful and that I suspect many readers will also
ﬁnd useful. It is the philosophy of the ancient Stoics. The Stoic
philosophy of life may be old, but it merits the attention of any
modern individual who wishes to have a life that is both meaningful and fulﬁlling—who wishes, that is, to have a good life.
In other words, this book offers advice on how people
should live. More precisely, I will act as a conduit for the advice
offered by Stoic philosophers two thousand years ago. This

Introduction 5

is something my fellow philosophers are generally loath to
do, but then again, their interest in philosophy is primarily
“academic”; their research, that is to say, is primarily theoretical or historical. My interest in Stoicism, by way of contrast, is
resolutely practical: My goal is to put this philosophy to work
in my life and to encourage others to put it to work in theirs.
The ancient Stoics, I think, would have encouraged both sorts
of endeavor, but they also would have insisted that the primary
reason to study Stoicism is so we can put it into practice.
Another thing to realize is that although Stoicism is a philosophy, it has a signiﬁcant psychological component. The Stoics
realized that a life plagued with negative emotions—including
anger, anxiety, fear, grief, and envy—will not be a good life.
They therefore became acute observers of the workings of
the human mind and as a result became some of the most
insightful psychologists of the ancient world. They went on
to develop techniques for preventing the onset of negative
emotions and for extinguishing them when attempts at prevention failed. Even those readers who are leery of philosophical
speculation should take an interest in these techniques. Who
among us, after all, would not like to reduce the number of
negative emotions experienced in daily living?
Although I have been studying philosophy for all my adult
life, I was, until recently, woefully ignorant of Stoicism. My
teachers in college and graduate school never asked me to
read the Stoics, and although I am an avid reader, I saw no
need to read them on my own. More generally, I saw no need
to ponder a philosophy of life. I instead felt comfortable with

6 Introduction

what is, for almost everyone, the default philosophy of life: to
spend one’s days seeking an interesting mix of afﬂuence, social
status, and pleasure. My philosophy of life, in other words,
was what might charitably be called an enlightened form of
hedonism.
In my ﬁfth decade of life, though, events conspired to introduce me to Stoicism. The ﬁrst of these was the 1998 publication by the author Tom Wolfe of A Man in Full. In this novel,
one character accidentally discovers the Stoic philosopher
Epictetus and then starts spouting his philosophy. I found this
to be simultaneously intriguing and puzzling.
Two years later I started doing research for a book about
desire. As part of this research, I examined the advice that has
been given over the millennia on mastering desire. I started
out by seeing what religions, including Christianity, Hinduism,
Taoism, Sufism, and Buddhism (and in particular, Zen
Buddhism), had to say about desire. I went on to examine the
advice on mastering desire offered by philosophers but found
that only a relative handful of them had offered such advice.
Prominent among those who had were the Hellenistic philosophers: the Epicureans, Skeptics, and Stoics.
In conducting my research on desire, I had an ulterior
motive. I had long been intrigued by Zen Buddhism and imagined that on taking a closer look at it in connection with my
research, I would become a full-ﬂedged convert. But what
I found, much to my surprise, was that Stoicism and Zen have
certain things in common. They both, for example, stress the
importance of contemplating the transitory nature of the
world around us and the importance of mastering desire, to

Introduction 7

the extent that it is possible to do so. They also advise us to
pursue tranquility and give us advice on how to attain and
maintain it. Furthermore, I came to realize that Stoicism was
better suited to my analytical nature than Buddhism was. As
a result, I found myself, much to my amazement, toying with
the idea of becoming, instead of a practicing Zen Buddhist, a
practicing Stoic.
Before I began my research on desire, Stoicism had been, for
me, a nonstarter as a philosophy of life, but as I read the Stoics,
I discovered that almost everything I thought I knew about
them was wrong. To begin with, I knew that the dictionary
deﬁnes a stoic as “one who is seemingly indifferent to or unaffected by joy, grief, pleasure, or pain.”3 I therefore expected
that the uppercase-S Stoics would be lowercase-s stoical—that
they would be emotionally repressed individuals. I discovered,
though, that the goal of the Stoics was not to banish emotion
from life but to banish negative emotions.
When I read the works of the Stoics, I encountered individuals who were cheerful and optimistic about life (even
though they made it a point to spend time thinking about all
the bad things that could happen to them) and who were fully
capable of enjoying life’s pleasures (while at the same time
being careful not to be enslaved by those pleasures). I also
encountered, much to my surprise, individuals who valued
joy; indeed, according to Seneca, what Stoics seek to discover
“is how the mind may always pursue a steady and favourable
course, may be well-disposed towards itself, and may view its
conditions with joy.”4 He also asserts that someone who practices Stoic principles “must, whether he wills or not, necessarily

8 Introduction

be attended by constant cheerfulness and a joy that is deep
and issues from deep within, since he ﬁnds delight in his own
resources, and desires no joys greater than his inner joys.”5
Along similar lines, the Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus tells
us that if we live in accordance with Stoic principles, “a cheerful
disposition and secure joy” will automatically follow.6
Rather than being passive individuals who were grimly
resigned to being on the receiving end of the world’s abuse
and injustice, the Stoics were fully engaged in life and worked
hard to make the world a better place. Consider, for example,
Cato the Younger. (Although he did not contribute to the literature of Stoicism, Cato was a practicing Stoic; indeed, Seneca
refers to him as the perfect Stoic.)7 His Stoicism did not prevent
Cato from ﬁghting bravely to restore the Roman republic.
Likewise, Seneca seems to have been remarkably energetic:
Besides being a philosopher, he was a successful playwright,
an advisor to an emperor, and the ﬁrst-century equivalent of
an investment banker. And Marcus Aurelius, besides being a
philosopher, was a Roman emperor—indeed, arguably one
of the greatest Roman emperors. As I read about the Stoics,
I found myself ﬁlled with admiration for them. They were
courageous, temperate, reasonable, and self-disciplined—traits
I would like to possess. They also thought it important for us to
fulﬁll our obligations and to help our fellow humans—values
I happen to share.
In my research on desire, I discovered nearly unanimous
agreement among thoughtful people that we are unlikely to
have a good and meaningful life unless we can overcome our
insatiability. There was also agreement that one wonderful

Introduction 9

way to tame our tendency to always want more is to persuade
ourselves to want the things we already have. This seemed to
be an important insight, but it left open the question of how,
exactly, we could accomplish this. The Stoics, I was delighted to
discover, had an answer to this question. They developed a fairly
simple technique that, if practiced, can make us glad, if only for
a time, to be the person we are, living the life we happen to be
living, almost regardless of what that life might be.
The more I studied the Stoics, the more I found myself
drawn to their philosophy. But when I tried to share with
others my newfound enthusiasm for Stoicism, I quickly discovered that I had not been alone in misconceiving the philosophy.
Friends, relatives, and even my colleagues at the university
seemed to think the Stoics were individuals whose goal was to
suppress all emotion and who therefore led grim and passive
lives. It dawned on me that the Stoics were the victims of a
bum rap, one that I myself had only recently helped promote.
This realization alone might have been sufﬁcient to motivate me to write a book about the Stoics—a book that would
set the record straight—but as it happens, I came to have a
second motivation even stronger than this. After learning about
Stoicism, I started, in a low-key, experimental fashion, giving it
a try as my philosophy of life. The experiment has thus far been
sufﬁciently successful that I feel compelled to report my ﬁndings to the world at large, in the belief that others might beneﬁt
from studying the Stoics and adopting their philosophy of life.
Readers will naturally be curious about what is involved
in the practice of Stoicism. In ancient Greece and Rome, a

10 Introduction

would-be Stoic could have learned how to practice Stoicism
by attending a Stoic school, but this is no longer possible.
A modern would-be Stoic might, as an alternative, consult
the works of the ancient Stoics, but what she will discover on
attempting to do so is that many of these works—in particular, those of the Greek Stoics—have been lost. Furthermore,
if she reads the works that have survived, she will discover that
although they discuss Stoicism at length, they don’t offer a
lesson plan, as it were, for novice Stoics. The challenge I faced
in writing this book was to construct such a plan from clues
scattered throughout Stoic writings.
Although the remainder of this book provides detailed
guidelines for would-be Stoics, let me describe here, in a
preliminary fashion, some of the things we will want to do if
we adopt Stoicism as our philosophy of life.
We will reconsider our goals in living. In particular, we will
take to heart the Stoic claim that many of the things we desire—
most notably, fame and fortune—are not worth pursuing. We
will instead turn our attention to the pursuit of tranquility and
what the Stoics called virtue. We will discover that Stoic virtue
has very little in common with what people today mean by
the word. We will also discover that the tranquility the Stoics
sought is not the kind of tranquility that might be brought on
by the ingestion of a tranquilizer; it is not, in other words, a
zombie-like state. It is instead a state marked by the absence of
negative emotions such as anger, grief, anxiety, and fear, and
the presence of positive emotions—in particular, joy.
We will study the various psychological techniques developed by the Stoics for attaining and maintaining tranquility,

Introduction 11

and we will employ these techniques in daily living. We will,
for example, take care to distinguish between things we can
control and things we can’t, so that we will no longer worry
about the things we can’t control and will instead focus our
attention on the things we can control. We will also recognize
how easy it is for other people to disturb our tranquility, and
we will therefore practice Stoic strategies to prevent them
from upsetting us.
Finally, we will become a more thoughtful observer of our
own life. We will watch ourselves as we go about our daily
business and will later reﬂect on what we saw, trying to identify the sources of distress in our life and thinking about how
to avoid that distress.
Practicing Stoicism will obviously take effort, but this is
true of all genuine philosophies of life. Indeed, even “enlightened hedonism” takes effort. The enlightened hedonist’s grand
goal in living is to maximize the pleasure he experiences in
the course of a lifetime. To practice this philosophy of life,
he will spend time discovering, exploring, and ranking sources
of pleasure and investigating any untoward side effects they
might have. The enlightened hedonist will then devise strategies for maximizing the amount of pleasure he experiences.
(Unenlightened hedonism, in which a person thoughtlessly
seeks short-term gratiﬁcation, is not, I think, a coherent philosophy of life.)
The effort required to practice Stoicism will probably be
greater than that required to practice enlightened hedonism
but less than that required to practice, say, Zen Buddhism.

12 Introduction

A Zen Buddhist will have to meditate, a practice that is both
time-consuming and (in some of its forms) physically and
mentally challenging. The practice of Stoicism, in contrast,
doesn’t require us to set aside blocks of time in which to “do
Stoicism.” It does require us periodically to reﬂect on our life,
but these periods of reﬂection can generally be squeezed into
odd moments of the day, such as when we are stuck in trafﬁc
or—this was Seneca’s recommendation—when we are lying in
bed waiting for sleep to come.
When assessing the “costs” associated with practicing
Stoicism or any other philosophy of life, readers should realize
that there are costs associated with not having a philosophy of
life. I have already mentioned one such cost: the danger that
you will spend your days pursuing valueless things and will
therefore waste your life.
Some readers might, at this point, wonder whether the
practice of Stoicism is compatible with their religious beliefs.
In the case of most religions, I think it is. Christians in particular will ﬁnd that Stoic doctrines resonate with their religious
views. They will, for example, share the Stoics’ desire to attain
tranquility, although Christians might call it peace. They will
appreciate Marcus Aurelius’s injunction to “love mankind.”8
And when they encounter Epictetus’s observation that some
things are up to us and some things are not, and that if we
have any sense at all, we will focus our energies on the things
that are up to us, Christians will be reminded of the “Serenity
Prayer,” often attributed to the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.
Having said this, I should add that it is also possible for someone simultaneously to be an agnostic and a practicing Stoic.

Introduction 13

The remainder of this book is divided into four parts. In part
1, I describe the birth of philosophy. Although modern philosophers tend to spend their days debating esoteric topics, the
primary goal of most ancient philosophers was to help ordinary people live better lives. Stoicism, as we shall see, was one
of the most popular and successful of the ancient schools of
philosophy.
In parts 2 and 3, I explain what we must do in order to practice Stoicism. I start by describing the psychological techniques
the Stoics developed to attain and subsequently maintain tranquility. I then describe Stoic advice on how best to deal with the
stresses of everyday life: How, for example, should we respond
when someone insults us? Although much has changed in the
past two millennia, human psychology has changed little. This
is why those of us living in the twenty-ﬁrst century can beneﬁt
from the advice that philosophers such as Seneca offered to
ﬁrst-century Romans.
Finally, in part 4 of this book, I defend Stoicism against various
criticisms, and I reevaluate Stoic psychology in light of modern
scientiﬁc ﬁndings. I end the book by relating the insights I have
gained in my own practice of Stoicism.
My fellow academics might have an interest in this book;
they might, for example, be curious about my interpretation of
various Stoic utterances. The audience I am most interested in
reaching, though, is ordinary individuals who worry that they
might be misliving. This includes those who have come to the
realization that they lack a coherent philosophy of life and as a
result are ﬂoundering in their daily activities: what they work
to accomplish one day only undoes what they accomplished

14 Introduction

the day before. It also includes those who have a philosophy of
life but worry that it is somehow defective.
I wrote this book with the following question in mind: If
the ancient Stoics had taken it upon themselves to write a
guidebook for twenty-ﬁrst-century individuals—a book that
would tell us how to have a good life—what might that book
have looked like? The pages that follow are my answer to this
question.

Philosophy Takes an
Interest in Life
There have probably always been philosophers, in some
sense of the word. They were those individuals who not
only asked questions—such as Where did the world come
from? Where did people come from? and Why are there rainbows?—but more important, went on to ask follow-up questions. When told, for example, that the world was created by
the gods, these proto-philosophers would have realized that
this answer didn’t get to the bottom of things. They would
have gone on to ask why the gods made the world, how they
made it, and—most vexatiously to those trying to answer their
questions—who made the gods.
However and whenever it may have started, philosophical
thinking took a giant leap forward in the sixth century bc.
We ﬁnd Pythagoras (570–500 bc) philosophizing in Italy; Thales
(636–546 bc), Anaximander (641–547 bc), and Heracleitus (535–
475 bc) in Greece; Confucius (551–479 bc) in China; and Buddha
(563–483 bc) in India. It isn’t clear whether these individuals
discovered philosophy independently of one another; nor is
it clear which direction philosophical inﬂuence ﬂowed, if it
indeed ﬂowed.

18 The Rise of Stoicism

The Greek biographer Diogenes Laertius, from the vantage
point of the third century ad, offered an eminently readable
(but not entirely reliable) history of early philosophy. According
to Diogenes, early Western philosophy had two separate
branches.1 One branch—he calls it the Italian branch—began
with Pythagoras. If we follow through the various successors
of Pythagoras, we ultimately come to Epicurus, whose own
school of philosophy was a major rival to the Stoic school. The
other branch—Diogenes calls it the Ionian branch—started
with Anaximander, who (intellectually, pedagogically) begat
Anaximenes, who begat Anaxagoras, who begat Archelaus,
who, ﬁnally, begat Socrates (469–399 bc).
Socrates lived a remarkable life. He also died a remarkable
death: He had been tried for corrupting the youth of Athens
and other alleged misdeeds, found guilty by his fellow citizens, and sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. He
could have avoided this punishment by throwing himself on
the mercy of the court or by running away after the sentence
had been handed down. His philosophical principles, though,
would not let him do these things. After his death, Socrates’
many followers not only continued to do philosophy but
attracted followers of their own. Plato, the best-known of
his students, founded the school of philosophy known as the
Academy, Aristippus founded the Cyrenaic school, Euclides
founded the Megarian school, Phaedo founded the Elian
school, and Antisthenes founded the Cynic school. What had
been a trickle of philosophical activity before Socrates became,
after his death, a veritable torrent.

Philosophy Takes an Interest in Life 19

Why did this explosion of interest in philosophy take place?
In part because Socrates changed the focus of philosophical
inquiry. Before Socrates, philosophers were primarily interested in explaining the world around them and the phenomena
of that world—in doing what we would now call science.
Although Socrates studied science as a young man, he abandoned it to focus his attention on the human condition. As
the Roman orator, politician, and philosopher Cicero put
it, Socrates was “the ﬁrst to call philosophy down from the
heavens and set her in the cities of men and bring her also
into their homes and compel her to ask questions about life
and morality and things good and evil.”2 The classicist Francis
MacDonald Cornford describes Socrates’ philosophical signiﬁcance in similar terms: “Pre-Socratic philosophy begins . . . with
the discovery of Nature; Socratic philosophy begins with the
discovery of man’s soul.”3
Why does Socrates remain an impressive ﬁgure twenty-four
centuries after his death? It isn’t because of his philosophical
discoveries; his philosophical conclusions, after all, were basically negative: He showed us what we don’t know. Rather, it
was the extent to which he allowed his way of life to be affected
by his philosophical speculations. Indeed, according to the
philosopher Luis E. Navia, “in [Socrates], perhaps more than
in any other major philosopher, we come upon the example
of a man who was able to integrate in his life theoretical and
speculative concerns into the context of his daily activities.”
Navia describes him as “a veritable paradigm of philosophical
activity both in thought and in deed.”4

20 The Rise of Stoicism

Presumably, some of those drawn to Socrates were impressed
primarily by his theorizing, while others were most impressed by
his lifestyle. Plato belonged to the former group; in his Academy,
Plato was more interested in exploring philosophical theory than
in dispensing lifestyle advice. Antisthenes, in contrast, was most
impressed with Socrates’ lifestyle; the Cynic school he founded
eschewed philosophical theorizing and focused instead on
advising people about what they must do to have a good life.
It is as if Socrates, on his death, had ﬁssioned into Plato and
Antisthenes, with Plato inheriting Socrates’ interest in theory
and Antisthenes inheriting his concern with living a good life.
It would have been wonderful if these two sides of philosophy
had ﬂourished in subsequent millennia, inasmuch as people
beneﬁt from both philosophical theorizing and the application
of philosophy to their own life. Unfortunately, although the
theoretical side of philosophy has ﬂourished, the practical side
has withered away.
Under a despotic government such as that of ancient Persia,
the ability to write, read, and do arithmetic was important
for government ofﬁcials, but the ability to persuade others
wasn’t. Ofﬁcials needed only give orders, which those under
their power would unhesitatingly obey. In Greece and Rome,
however, the rise of democracy meant that those who were
able to persuade others were most likely to have successful
careers in politics or law. It was in part for this reason that
afﬂuent Greek and Roman parents, after a child’s secondary
education was completed, sought teachers who could develop
their child’s persuasive ability.

Philosophy Takes an Interest in Life 21

These parents might have sought the services of a sophist,
whose goal was to teach pupils to win arguments. To achieve
this goal, sophists taught various techniques of persuasion,
including both appeals to reason and appeals to emotion. In
particular, they taught students that it was possible to argue for
or against any proposition whatsoever. Along with developing
pupils’ argumentative skills, sophists developed their speaking
skills, so they could effectively communicate the arguments
they devised.
Alternatively, parents might have sought the services of
a philosopher. Like sophists, philosophers taught persuasive techniques, but unlike sophists, they eschewed appeals
to emotion. Also unlike sophists, philosophers thought that
besides teaching their pupils how to persuade, they should
teach them how to live well. Consequently, according to the
historian H. I. Marrou, in their teaching they emphasized “the
moral aspect of education, the development of the personality
and the inner life.”5 In the course of doing this, many philosophers provided their pupils with a philosophy of life: They
taught them what things in life were worth pursuing and how
best to pursue them.
Some of the parents who wanted a philosophical education for their child hired a philosopher to act as live-in tutor;
Aristotle, for example, was hired by King Philip of Macedon
to tutor Alexander, who subsequently became “the Great.”
Parents who could not afford a private tutor would have sent
their sons—but probably not their daughters—to a school of
philosophy. After the death of Socrates, these schools became a
prominent feature of Athenian culture, and when, in the second

22 The Rise of Stoicism

century bc, Rome came under the spell of Athenian culture,
schools of philosophy started appearing in Rome as well.
There are no longer schools of philosophy, and this is a
shame. It is true that philosophy is still done within schools—
more precisely, within the philosophy departments of universities—but the cultural role played by philosophy departments
is quite unlike the role played by the ancient philosophical
schools. For one thing, those who sign up for the philosophy
classes offered by universities are rarely motivated to do so by a
desire to acquire a philosophy of life; instead, they take classes
because their advisor tells them that if they don’t, they can’t
graduate. And if they do seek a philosophy of life, they would,
in most universities, have a hard time ﬁnding a class that would
offer them one.
But even though schools of philosophy are a thing of the
past, people are in as much need of a philosophy of life as they
ever were. The question is, Where can they go to obtain one?
If they go to the philosophy department of the local university, they will, as I have explained, probably be disappointed.
What if they instead turn to their local church? Their pastor
might tell them what they must do to be a good person, that
is, what they must do to be morally upstanding. They might be
instructed, for example, not to steal or tell lies or (in some religions) have an abortion. Their pastor will also probably explain
what they must do to have a good afterlife: They should come
to services regularly and pray and (in some religions) tithe. But
their pastor will probably have relatively little to say on what
they must do to have a good life. Indeed, most religions, after

Philosophy Takes an Interest in Life 23

telling adherents what they must do to be morally upstanding
and get into heaven, leave it to them to determine what
things in life are and aren’t worth pursuing. These religions
see nothing wrong with an adherent working hard so he can
afford a huge mansion and an expensive sports car, as long as
he doesn’t break any laws doing so; nor do they see anything
wrong with the adherent forsaking the mansion for a hut and
forsaking the car for a bicycle.
And if religions do offer adherents advice on what things
in life are and aren’t worth pursuing, they tend to offer the
advice in such a low-key manner that adherents might regard
it as a suggestion rather than a directive about how to live and
might therefore ignore the advice. This, one imagines, is why
the adherents of the various religions, despite the differences
in their religious beliefs, end up with the same impromptu
philosophy of life, namely, a form of enlightened hedonism.
Thus, although Lutherans, Baptists, Jews, Mormons, and
Catholics hold different religious views, they are remarkably
alike when encountered outside of church or synagogue. They
hold similar jobs and have similar career ambitions. They live
in similar homes, furnished in a similar manner. And they
lust to the same degree for whatever consumer products are
currently in vogue.
It is clearly possible for a religion to require its adherents to
adopt a particular philosophy of life. Consider, by way of illustration, the Hutterite religion, which teaches its adherents that
one of the most valuable things in life is a sense of community.
Hutterites are therefore forbidden to own private property, the
rationale being that such ownership would give rise to feelings

24 The Rise of Stoicism

of envy, which in turn would disrupt the sense of community
the Hutterites value. (We can, of course, question whether this
is a sound philosophy of life.)
Most religions, however, don’t require their adherents to adopt
a particular philosophy of life. As long as adherents don’t harm
others and don’t do things to anger God, they are free to live their
life as they will. Indeed, if the Hutterite religion seems both extreme and exotic to most people, it is because they can’t imagine belonging to a religion that tells them how to live their life.
What this means is that it is entirely possible these days for
someone to have been raised in a religion and to have taken
philosophy courses in college but still to be lacking a philosophy
of life. (Indeed, this is the situation in which most of my students
ﬁnd themselves.) What, then, should those seeking a philosophy
of life do? Perhaps their best option is to create for themselves a
virtual school of philosophy by reading the works of the philosophers who ran the ancient schools. This, at any rate, is what, in
the following pages, I will be encouraging readers to do.
In ancient Greece, when schools of philosophy were still
prominent features of the cultural landscape, there were any
number of schools to which parents could send their children. Suppose we could travel back in time to 300 bc and take
a thinking person’s walking tour of Athens. We could begin
our tour in the Agora, where Socrates a century earlier had
philosophized with the citizens of Athens. On the northern
side of the Agora we would see the Stoa Poikile, or Painted
Porch, and holding forth there might be Zeno of Citium, the
founder of the Stoic school of philosophy. This “porch” was
actually a colonnade decorated with murals.

Philosophy Takes an Interest in Life 25

As we walked through Athens, we might come across the
Cynic philosopher Crates, whose school of philosophy Zeno
had once attended. Although the ﬁrst Cynics met near the
gymnasium of Cynosarges—hence their name—they could
be found anywhere in Athens, attempting to draw (or drag,
if need be) ordinary people into philosophical discussions.
Furthermore, whereas parents might have willingly sent their
children to study with Zeno, it is unlikely that they encouraged them to become Cynics, inasmuch as Cynic doctrines, if
successfully internalized, would guarantee their child a life of
ignominious poverty.
Heading northwest and leaving the city by Dipylon Gate,
we would come to the Garden of the Epicureans, presided
over by Epicurus himself. Whereas the Painted Porch was in
an urban setting, with Stoic lectures periodically interrupted,
one imagines, by noise from the street or the comments of
passers-by, Epicurus’s Garden had a distinctly rural feel. The
Garden was in fact a working garden in which the Epicureans
grew their own vegetables.
Continuing toward the northwest, about a mile from the
Agora, we would come to the Academy, the school of philosophy founded by Plato in 387 bc, a bit more than a decade after
the death of Socrates. Like Epicurus’s Garden, the Academy
would have been a striking place in which to philosophize. It
was a parklike retreat, furnished with walks and fountains.
On the Academy grounds were buildings, paid for by Plato
and his friends. Holding forth there in 300 bc might have been
Polemo, who had inherited the position of master of the
school. (The Stoic philosopher Zeno, as we shall see, attended
Polemo’s school for a time.)

26 The Rise of Stoicism

Doubling back, going through the city again, and exiting
the city gates into the eastern suburbs of Athens, we would
have come to the Lyceum. In this wooded area, near a shrine
to Apollo Lykeios, we could see the Peripatetics, disciples of
Aristotle, walking and talking, and at the head of the group
might be Theophrastus.
But this is only the beginning of the educational options
open to ancient parents. Besides the schools mentioned in
connection with our walking tour, there were the Cyrenaic,
Skeptic, Megarian, and Elian schools mentioned earlier, to
which we can add several other schools mentioned by Diogenes
Laertius, including the Eretrian, Annicerean, and Theodorean
schools, along with the schools run by the Eudaemonists, the
Truth-lovers, the Refutationists, the Reasoners from Analogy,
the Physicists, the Moralists, and the Dialecticians.6
As it so happens, young men (and, rarely, young women)
weren’t the only ones to attend schools of philosophy.
Sometimes fathers studied alongside their sons. In other cases,
adults attended a school’s lectures by themselves. Some of
these adults were simply interested in philosophy; perhaps they
had attended a school as a youth and now sought “continuing
education” in the philosophy of life taught by that school.
Other adults, though never having belonged to a school, might
have attended its lectures as guests. Their motives were probably very much like the motives modern individuals have in
attending a public lecture: They sought to be enlightened and
entertained.
Yet other adults had an ulterior motive for attending
schools of philosophy: They wanted to start their own school

Philosophy Takes an Interest in Life 27

and listened to the lectures of heads of successful schools in
order to borrow philosophical ideas they could use in their
own teaching. Zeno of Citium was accused of doing just this:
Polemo complained that Zeno’s motive for attending lectures
at the Academy was to steal his doctrines.7
The rival schools of philosophy differed in the subjects
they taught. The early Stoics, for example, were interested not
only in a philosophy of life, but in physics and logic as well,
for the simple reason that they thought these areas of study
were inherently entwined. The Epicureans shared the Stoics’
interest in physics (although they had different views about the
physical world than the Stoics did) but did not likewise share
their interest in logic. The Cyrenaics and Cynics were interested in neither physics nor logic; at their schools, all one was
taught was a philosophy of life.
Those schools that offered students a philosophy of life
differed in the philosophy they recommended. The Cyrenaics,
for example, thought the grand goal in living was the experience of pleasure and therefore advocated taking advantage
of every opportunity to experience it. The Cynics advocated
an ascetic lifestyle: If you want a good life, they argued, you
must learn to want next to nothing. The Stoics fell somewhere
between the Cyrenaics and the Cynics: They thought people
should enjoy the good things life has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good
things. Indeed, they thought we should periodically interrupt
our enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating the loss of whatever it is we are enjoying.

28 The Rise of Stoicism

Afﬁliating oneself with a school of philosophy was a serious
business. According to the historian Simon Price, “Adherence
to a philosophical sect was not simply a matter for the mind, or
the result of mere intellectual fashion. Those who took their
philosophy seriously attempted to live that philosophy from
day to day.”8 And just as a modern individual’s religion can
become the key element of his personal identity—think of a
born-again Christian—an ancient Greek’s or Roman’s philosophical association became an important part of who he was.
According to the historian Paul Veyne, “To truly be a philosopher was to live out the sect’s doctrine, conform one’s conduct
(and even one’s attire) to it, and if need be, to die for it.”9
Readers of this book should therefore keep in mind that
although I am advocating Stoicism as a philosophy of life, it
isn’t the only option available to those seeking such a philosophy. Furthermore, although the Stoics thought they could
prove that theirs was the correct philosophy of life, I don’t
(as we shall see in chapter 21) think such a proof is possible.
Instead, I think that which philosophy of life a person should
choose depends on her personality and circumstances.
But having made this admission, let me add that I think
there are very many people whose personality and circumstances make them wonderful candidates for the practice of
Stoicism. Furthermore, whatever philosophy of life a person
ends up adopting, she will probably have a better life than if
she tried to live—as many people do—without a coherent
philosophy of life.

T WO

The First Stoics

Zeno (333–261 bc) was the ﬁrst Stoic. (And by Zeno, I mean
Zeno of Citium, not to be confused with Zeno of Elea, who is
famous for a paradox involving Achilles and a tortoise, or with
any of the seven other Zenos mentioned by Diogenes Laertius
in his biographical sketches.) Zeno’s father was a merchant
of purple dye and used to come home from his travels with
books for Zeno to read. Among them were philosophy books
purchased in Athens. These books aroused Zeno’s interest in
both philosophy and Athens.
As the result of a shipwreck, Zeno found himself in Athens,
and while there, he decided to take advantage of the philosophical resources the city had to offer. He went to a bookseller’s shop and asked where men like Socrates could be found.
Just then, Crates the Cynic was walking by. The bookseller
pointed to him and said, “Follow yonder man.” And so it was,
we are told, that Zeno became Crates’ pupil. Looking back on
this time in his life, Zeno commented, “I made a prosperous
voyage when I suffered shipwreck.”1
The Cynics had little interest in philosophical theorizing.
They instead advocated a rather extreme philosophical lifestyle.

30 The Rise of Stoicism

They were ascetics. Socially speaking, they were the ancient
equivalent of what we today call the homeless: They lived in the
streets and slept on the ground. They owned only the clothing on
their backs, typically one poor cloak, what the ancients refer to as
“Cynic garb.” Theirs was a day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence.
When someone told Epictetus—who, although himself a Stoic,
was familiar with Cynicism—that he was contemplating joining
the Cynic school, Epictetus explained what becoming a Cynic
would entail: “You must utterly put away the will to get, and must
will to avoid only what lies within the sphere of your will: you
must harbour no anger, wrath, envy, pity: a fair maid, a fair name,
favourites, or sweet cakes, must mean nothing to you.” A Cynic,
he explained, “must have the spirit of patience in such measure
as to seem to the multitude as unfeeling as a stone. Reviling or
blows or insults are nothing to him.”2 Few people, one imagines,
had the courage and endurance to live the life of a Cynic.
The Cynics were renowned for their wit and wisdom.
When, for example, someone asked what sort of woman a
man should marry, Antisthenes replied that no matter what
woman he chose for his wife, he would live to regret marrying:
“If she’s beautiful, you’ll not have her to yourself; if she’s ugly,
you’ll pay for it dearly.” Concerning our dealings with other
people, he commented that “it is better to fall in with crows
than with flatterers; for in the one case you are devoured
when dead, in the other case while alive.” He also advised his
listeners to “pay attention to your enemies, for they are the
ﬁrst to discover your mistakes.” Despite, or perhaps because
of, his sharp wit, Antisthenes was described as being “the most
agreeable of men in conversation.”3

The First Stoics 31

Diogenes of Sinope (not to be confused with Diogenes
Laertius, who wrote a biographical sketch of him and other
philosophers) was a student of Antisthenes and went on to
become the most famous Cynic. In defense of simple living,
Diogenes observed that “the gods had given to men the means
of living easily, but this had been put out of sight, because we
require honeyed cakes, unguents and the like.” Such is the
madness of men, he said, that they choose to be miserable
when they have it in their power to be content. The problem is
that “bad men obey their lusts as servants obey their masters,”
and because they cannot control their desires, they can never
ﬁnd contentment.4
Men’s values, Diogenes insisted, had been corrupted. He
pointed out, by way of illustration, that a statue, the only
function of which is to please the eye, might cost three thousand drachmas, while a quart of barley ﬂour, which when
consumed can keep us alive, can be bought for only two
copper coins.5 He believed hunger to be the best appetizer,
and because he waited until he was hungry or thirsty before
he ate or drank, “he used to partake of a barley cake with
greater pleasure than others did of the costliest of foods, and
enjoyed a drink from a stream of running water more than
others did their Thasian wine.”6 When asked about his lack
of an abode, Diogenes would reply that he had access to the
greatest houses in every city—to their temples and gymnasia,
that is. And when asked what he had learned from philosophy,
Diogenes replied, “To be prepared for every fortune.”7 This
reply, as we shall see, anticipates one important theme of
Stoicism.

32 The Rise of Stoicism

The Cynics plied their trade not in a suburban setting,
as Epicurus and Plato did, but on the streets of Athens, as
Socrates had done. And like Socrates, the Cynics sought to
instruct not only those who offered themselves as pupils but
anyone at all, including those who were reluctant to be taught.
Indeed, the Cynic Crates—who, as we have seen, was the
Stoic philosopher Zeno’s ﬁrst philosophical teacher—wasn’t
content simply with badgering the people he encountered
on the street; he also entered people’s homes uninvited to
admonish those within. For this habit, he became known as
“the Door Opener.”8
After studying with Crates for a time, Zeno decided that he
was more interested in theory than Crates was. He therefore
came up with the idea of focusing not just on a philosophical
lifestyle or a philosophical theory, but combining lifestyle with
theory, the way Socrates had done.9 The nineteenth-century
German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer summed up the
relationship between Cynicism and Stoicism by observing
that the Stoic philosophers proceeded from the Cynics “by
changing the practical into the theoretical.”10
Zeno therefore set out to learn philosophical theory. He
went off to study with Stilpo, of the Megarian school. (Crates
responded by physically trying to drag him away.) He also
studied with Polemo at the Academy, and in around 300 bc,
he started his own school of philosophy. In his teaching, he
appears to have mixed the lifestyle advice of Crates with the
theoretical philosophy of Polemo. (According to Polemo,
Zeno did little more than give the doctrines of the Academy

The First Stoics 33

“a Phoenician make-up.”)11 Into this mix he incorporated the
Megarian school’s interest in logic and paradoxes.
Zeno’s school of philosophy enjoyed immediate success.12
His followers were initially called Zenonians, but because he
was in the habit of giving his lectures in the Stoa Poikile, they
subsequently became known as the Stoics—as, by the way, had
been the poets who had formerly been in the habit of hanging
out there.13
One thing that made Stoicism attractive was its abandonment of Cynic asceticism: The Stoics favored a lifestyle that,
although simple, allowed creature comforts. The Stoics
defended this abandonment by arguing that if they avoided the
“good things,” as the Cynics did, they thereby demonstrated
that the things in question really were good—were things that,
if they did not hide them from themselves, they would crave.
The Stoics enjoyed whatever “good things” happened to be
available, but even as they did so, they prepared themselves to
give up the things in question.
Zeno’s philosophy had ethical, physical, and logical components. Those who studied Stoicism under him started with
logic, moved on to physics, and ended with ethics.14
Although the Stoics were not the ﬁrst to do logic—Aristotle,
for example, had done it before them, as had the Megarians—
Stoic logic showed an unprecedented degree of sophistication.
The Stoics’ interest in logic is a natural consequence of their
belief that man’s distinguishing feature is his rationality. Logic
is, after all, the study of the proper use of reasoning. The Stoics
became experts on argument forms, such as “If A, then B; but

34 The Rise of Stoicism

A, therefore B” or “Either A or B; but not A, therefore B.” These
argument forms, which are called modus ponens and modus
tollendo ponens, respectively, are still used by logicians.
To understand the Stoics’ interest in logic, it helps to
remember that parents sent their children to schools of
philosophy not just so they could learn how to live well but
so they could sharpen their skills of persuasion. By teaching
their students logic, the Stoics were helping them develop
these skills: Students who knew logic could detect the fallacies committed by others and thereby prevail over them in
arguments.
Physics was the second component of Zeno’s Stoicism.
Living, as they did, in a time without science, Zeno’s students
doubtless appreciated explanations of the world around them.
And besides providing explanations of natural phenomena, as
modern physics does, Stoic physics was concerned with what
we would call theology. Zeno, for example, tried to explain
such things as the existence and nature of the gods, why the
gods created our universe and its inhabitants, the role the gods
play in determining the outcome of events, and the proper
relationship between people and the gods.
Ethics was the third and most important component of
Zeno’s Stoicism. The Stoic conception of ethics, readers
should realize, differs from our modern conception. We think
of ethics as the study of moral right and wrong. A modernday ethicist might wonder, for example, whether abortion is
morally permissible, and if so, under what circumstances. Stoic
ethics, in contrast, is what is called eudaemonistic ethics, from
the Greek eu meaning “good” and daimon meaning “spirit.”

The First Stoics 35

It is concerned not with moral right and wrong but with
having a “good spirit,” that is, with living a good, happy life or
with what is sometimes called moral wisdom.15 As the philosopher Lawrence C. Becker puts it, “Stoic ethics is a species of
eudaimonism. Its central, organizing concern is about what we
ought to do or be to live well—to ﬂourish.”16 In the words of
the historian Paul Veyne, “Stoicism is not so much an ethic as
it is a paradoxical recipe for happiness.”17
It is easy for modern readers to misconstrue what the Stoics
had in mind by “a good life.” Indeed, many readers will equate
having a good life with making a good living—with, that is,
having a high-paying job. The Stoics, however, thought it
entirely possible for someone to have a bad life despite making
a very good living. Suppose, for example, that he hates his
high-paying job, or suppose that the job creates conﬂict within
him by requiring him to do things he knows to be wrong.
What, then, must a person do to have what the Stoics would
call a good life? Be virtuous! But again, “virtue” is a word that
invites misunderstanding. Tell a modern reader that the Stoics
advocate that she live in a virtuous manner, and she might roll
her eyes; indeed, to this reader, nuns would be prime examples
of virtuous individuals, and what makes them virtuous are
their chastity, humility, and kindheartedness. Are the Stoics,
then, advocating that we live like nuns?
In fact, this isn’t at all what the Stoics have in mind when
they talk about virtue. For the Stoics, a person’s virtue does
not depend, for example, on her sexual history. Instead, it
depends on her excellence as a human being—on how well she

36 The Rise of Stoicism

performs the function for which humans were designed. In the
same way that a “virtuous” (or excellent) hammer is one that
performs well the function for which it was designed—namely,
to drive nails—a virtuous individual is one who performs well
the function for which humans were designed. To be virtuous,
then, is to live as we were designed to live; it is to live, as Zeno
put it, in accordance with nature.18 The Stoics would add that
if we do this, we will have a good life.
And for what function were people designed? To answer this
question, the Stoics thought, we need only examine ourselves.
On doing this, we will discover that we have certain instincts,
as do all animals. We experience hunger; this is nature’s way
of getting us to nourish ourselves. We also experience lust; this
is nature’s way of getting us to reproduce. But we differ from
other animals in one important respect: We have the ability to
reason. From this we can conclude, Zeno would assert, that
we were designed to be reasonable.
And if we use our reason, we will further conclude that
we were designed to do certain things, that we have certain
duties. Most signiﬁcantly, since nature intended us to be social
creatures, we have duties to our fellow men. We should, for
example, honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends, and be
concerned with the interests of our countrymen.19 It was this
sense of social duty that led the Stoic Cato to be an active player
in Roman politics, even though doing so cost him his life.
Although, as I have said, the primary concern of the Stoics
was with ethics—with living virtuously and thereby having a
good life—they were also interested in logic and physics. By
studying logic, they hoped to perform well one of the functions

The First Stoics 37

for which we were designed; namely, to behave in a rational
manner. And by studying physics, they hoped to gain insight
into the purpose for which we were designed. The Stoics came
up with various metaphors to explain the relationship between
the three components of their philosophy. They asserted, for
example, that Stoic philosophy is like a fertile ﬁeld, with “Logic
being the encircling fence, Ethics the crop, Physics the soil.”20
This metaphor makes clear the central role played by ethics in
their philosophy: Why worry about the soil and why build a
fence unless a crop will result?
If we lived in perfect accordance with nature—if, that is,
we were perfect in our practice of Stoicism—we would be
what the Stoics refer to as a wise man or sage. A Stoic sage,
according to Diogenes Laertius, is “free from vanity; for he is
indifferent to good or evil report.” He never feels grief, since
he realizes that grief is an “irrational contraction of the soul.”
His conduct is exemplary. He doesn’t let anything stop him
from doing his duty. Although he drinks wine, he doesn’t do so
in order to get drunk. The Stoic sage is, in short, “godlike.”21
Such godlikeness, the Stoics will be the ﬁrst to admit, is
exceedingly rare. For the Stoics, however, the near impossibility of becoming a sage is not a problem. They talk about
sages primarily so they will have a model to guide them in
their practice of Stoicism. The sage is a target for them to aim
at, even though they will probably fail to hit it. The sage, in
other words, is to Stoicism as Buddha is to Buddhism. Most
Buddhists can never hope to become as enlightened as Buddha,
but nevertheless, reﬂecting on Buddha’s perfection can help
them gain a degree of enlightenment.

38

The Rise of Stoicism

Cleanthes (331–232 bc) was a pupil in Zeno’s Stoic school,
and when Zeno died, he inherited leadership of the school.
When Cleanthes grew old, though, he started losing students
to other schools, and the future of Stoicism looked bleak.
When he died, leadership of the Stoic school was passed on to
his pupil Chrysippus (c. 282–206 bc), under whose leadership
the school regained its former prominence.
After the death of Chrysippus, the Stoic school continued
to prosper under a succession of leaders, including Panaetius
of Rhodes, who is remembered in the annals of Stoicism not
as an innovator but as an exporter of the philosophy. When
Panaetius traveled to Rome in around 140 bc, he took Stoicism
with him. He befriended Scipio Africanus and other Roman
gentlemen, got them interested in philosophy, and thereby
became the founder of Roman Stoicism.
After importing Stoicism, the Romans adapted the doctrine
to suit their needs. For one thing, they showed less interest in
logic and physics than the Greeks had. Indeed, by the time of
Marcus Aurelius, the last of the great Roman Stoics, logic and
physics had essentially been abandoned: In the Meditations, we
ﬁnd Marcus congratulating himself for not having wasted time
studying these subjects.22
The Romans also made subtle changes in the Greek Stoics’
ethical program. As we have seen, the primary ethical goal of
the Greek Stoics was the attainment of virtue. The Roman
Stoics retained this goal, but we ﬁnd them also repeatedly
advancing a second goal: the attainment of tranquility. And by
tranquility they did not have in mind a zombie-like state. (To
advocate that kind of tranquility, after all, would be a rejection

The First Stoics 39

of the rationality that the Stoics thought essential to virtuous
living.) Rather, Stoic tranquility was a psychological state
marked by the absence of negative emotions, such as grief,
anger, and anxiety, and the presence of positive emotions, such
as joy.
For the Roman Stoics, the goals of attaining tranquility and
attaining virtue were connected, and for this reason, when
they discuss virtue, they are likely to discuss tranquility as
well. In particular, they are likely to point out that one beneﬁt
of attaining virtue is that we will thereupon experience tranquility. Thus, early in his Discourses, Epictetus advises us to
pursue virtue but immediately reminds us that virtue “holds
out the promise . . . to create happiness and calm and serenity”
and that “progress toward virtue is progress toward each of
these states of mind.” Indeed, he goes so far as to identify
serenity as the result at which virtue aims.23
Because the Roman Stoics spent so much time discussing
tranquility (as a by-product of virtuous living), they create the
impression that they were disinterested in virtue. Consider, for
example, Epictetus’s Handbook, also known as his Manual or
Encheiridion. Arrian (one of Epictetus’s students) compiled
this work with the goal of providing second-century Roman
audiences with an easily accessible introduction to Stoicism.
Although the Handbook is ﬁlled with advice on what, according
to Epictetus, we must do if we wish to gain and maintain tranquility, Arrian saw no need to mention virtue.
One last comment is in order on the connection for the
Roman Stoics between the goal of attaining virtue and the
goal of attaining tranquility. Besides asserting that the pursuit

40 The Rise of Stoicism

of virtue will bring us tranquility, I think the Roman Stoics
would argue that the attainment of tranquility will help us
pursue virtue. Someone who is not tranquil—someone, that
is, who is distracted by negative emotions such as anger or
grief—might ﬁnd it difﬁcult to do what his reason tells him to
do: His emotions will triumph over his intellect. This person
might therefore become confused about what things are really
good, consequently might fail to pursue them, and might, as
a result, fail to attain virtue. Thus, for the Roman Stoics, the
pursuit of virtue and the pursuit of tranquility are components of a virtuous circle—indeed, a doubly virtuous circle:
The pursuit of virtue results in a degree of tranquility, which
in turn makes it easier for us to pursue virtue.
Why did the Roman Stoics give the attainment of tranquility
a more prominent role than their Greek predecessors did? Part
of the answer to this question, I think, is that the Roman Stoics
had less confidence than the Greeks in the power of pure
reason to motivate people. The Greek Stoics thought that the
best way to get people to pursue virtue was to make them
understand what things were good: If a person understood
what the truly good things were, he, being rational, would
necessarily pursue them and thereby become virtuous. The
Greek Stoics therefore saw little need to mention the beneﬁcial
by-products of the pursuit of virtue, including, most signiﬁcantly, the attainment of tranquility.
The Roman Stoics, in contrast, apparently thought it
wouldn’t be obvious to their fellow Romans why they should
pursue virtue. They also recognized that ordinary Romans

The First Stoics 41

would instinctively value tranquility and would consequently
be receptive to strategies for attaining it. The Roman Stoics
therefore seem to have concluded that by sugarcoating
virtue with tranquility—more precisely, by pointing to the
tranquility people would gain by pursuing virtue—they
would make Stoic doctrines more attractive to ordinary
Romans.
Furthermore, Stoic teachers such as Musonius Rufus and
Epictetus had another reason for highlighting tranquility: By
doing so, they made their school more attractive to potential
students. In the ancient world, we should remember, schools
of philosophy were in direct competition with each other. If
a school taught a philosophy that people found attractive, it
gained “market share,” but if a school’s philosophy fell out of
favor with potential students, the school might have sunk into
oblivion—which, as we have seen, almost happened to the
Stoic school under Cleanthes.
To gain and retain students, schools were willing to be ﬂexible in the philosophical doctrines they taught. It has been
suggested, for example, that in the middle of the third century
bc, the Academic and Stoic schools of philosophy, because they
were losing students to the rival Epicurean school, decided to
join into a philosophical alliance and modify their doctrines
accordingly, with the common purpose of attracting students
away from the Epicureans.24 Along similar lines, it is conceivable that the Roman Stoics, by accentuating tranquility in their
philosophy, might have been trying to attract students away
from the Epicureans, who also dangled the prospect of tranquility before their students.

42 The Rise of Stoicism

If it seems implausible that ancient philosophers would
“bend” philosophical doctrines in an attempt to attract
students, we should remember that this is precisely how many
ancient schools of philosophy got started. For example, when
Potamo of Alexandria decided to start a school of philosophy,
he had a stroke of marketing genius: He decided that the best
way to draw students was to cherry-pick from the philosophical doctrines of competing schools.25 Those who joined his
so-called Eclectic school could, he argued, gain the best that
each of the competing schools had to offer. More to the point,
we should remember that Zeno himself, to concoct Greek
Stoicism, bent and blended the doctrines of (at least) three
different philosophical schools: the Cynics, the Megarians, and
the Academy.
By highlighting tranquility in their philosophy, the Stoics
not only made it more attractive to ancient Romans but made
it, I think, more attractive to modern individuals as well. It is
unusual, after all, for modern individuals to have an interest in
becoming more virtuous, in the ancient sense of the word. (We
probably should be interested in becoming more virtuous, but
the brutal truth of the matter is that most of us aren’t.) Thus,
tell someone that you possess and are willing to share with him
an ancient strategy for attaining virtue, and you will likely be
met with a yawn. Tell him that you possess and are willing to
share an ancient strategy for attaining tranquility, though, and
his ears are likely to perk up; in most cases, people don’t need
to be convinced of the value of tranquility. Indeed, if asked, he
might go on at length about how his life has been blighted by
tranquility-disrupting negative emotions.

The First Stoics 43

It is for this reason that in the following pages I focus my
attention on the Roman rather than the Greek Stoics, and it
is for this reason that the primary focus of my examination of
the Roman Stoics is not their advice on how to attain virtue but
their advice on how to attain and maintain tranquility. Having
said this, I should add that readers who follow Roman Stoic
advice on attaining tranquility might thereby attain virtue as
well. Should this happen, so much the better!

T HREE

Roman Stoicism

The most important of the Roman Stoics—and the Stoics from
whom, I think, modern individuals have the most to gain—were
Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius.1 The
contributions these four made to Roman Stoicism were nicely
complementary. Seneca was the best writer of the bunch, and
his essays and letters to Lucilius form a quite accessible introduction to Roman Stoicism. Musonius is notable for his pragmatism: He offered detailed advice on how practicing Stoics
should eat, what they should wear, how they should behave
toward their parents, and even how they should conduct their
sex life. Epictetus’s specialty was analysis: He explained, among
other things, why practicing Stoicism can bring us tranquility.
Finally, in Marcus’s Meditations, written as a kind of diary, we
are privy to the thoughts of a practicing Stoic: We watch as he
searches for Stoic solutions to the problems of daily life as well
as the problems he encountered as emperor of Rome.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca, also known as Seneca the Younger,
was born sometime between 4 and 1 bc in Corduba, Spain.
Although we have more of his philosophical writings than we

Roman Stoicism 45

have of any other Stoic, he wasn’t the most proliﬁc of the Stoics.
(Chrysippus was remarkably proliﬁc, but his works have not
survived.) Nor was he particularly original. Nevertheless, his
Stoic writings are quite wonderful. His essays and letters are full
of insight into the human condition. In these writings, Seneca
talks about the things that typically make people unhappy—such
as grief, anger, old age, and social anxieties—and about what we
can do to make our life not just tolerable but joyful.
Seneca, like the other Roman Stoics I will discuss, was not
stoically resigned to life; he was instead an active participant
in it. And like these other Stoics, he was a complex individual.
Indeed, even if Seneca had never written a word of philosophy,
he would have made it into the history books for three other
reasons. He would be remembered as a successful playwright.
He would be remembered for his ﬁnancial undertakings: He
appears to have been a prototypical investment banker who
became enormously wealthy in large part because of his ﬁnancial acumen. And ﬁnally, he would be remembered for the role
he played in the politics of ﬁrst-century Rome; besides being
a senator, he was a tutor and subsequently a principal advisor
to Emperor Nero.
Seneca’s involvement with the imperial court got him into
trouble. When Claudius became emperor, he condemned Seneca
to death for (allegedly) committing adultery with Claudius’s
niece Julia Livilla. The sentence was commuted to banishment
and conﬁscation of all property, and so in the year 41, Seneca,
then in his forties, was sent off to the “barren and thorny rock”
that we call Corsica.2 During this time, he read, wrote, made a
study of the island—and presumably practiced his Stoicism.

46 The Rise of Stoicism

In 49, Agrippina married Claudius and talked him into
recalling Seneca from banishment so he could act as tutor for
her son Nero, who was then eleven or twelve. Thus it was that
after eight years of banishment, Seneca returned to Rome.
Again ensconced in Roman society, he became, we are told,
“the most renowned citizen of his time: the greatest living
writer in prose and verse, the greatest name in literature since
the golden age at the beginning of the century, and the favorite
of the imperious empress.”3 Seneca was as surprised as anyone
by his success in life: “Is it I,” he asked, “born in the station of
a simple knight and a provincial, who am numbered with the
magnates of the realm?”4
When Nero became emperor, Seneca was promoted to
the job of counselor. Indeed, he and Sextus Afranius Burrus,
the prefect of the Praetorian guard, became Nero’s inner
circle. At ﬁrst, Seneca and Burrus did a good job of keeping
Nero’s licentious tendencies in check, and the Roman empire
enjoyed ﬁve years of good government. Seneca also ﬂourished during this period: He became incredibly wealthy. This
wealth has given rise to the charge that Seneca was a hypocrite, that he advocated Stoic restraint while living a life of
extreme afﬂuence. Readers need to keep in mind, though,
that unlike Cynicism, Stoicism does not require its adherents to adopt an ascetic lifestyle. To the contrary, the Stoics
thought there is nothing wrong with enjoying the good
things life has to offer, as long as we are careful in the manner
in which we enjoy them. In particular, we must be ready to
give up the good things without regret if our circumstances
should change.

Roman Stoicism 47

After the death of Agrippina in 59—Nero had her killed—
Nero began to chafe at the guidance of Seneca and Burrus. In
62, Burrus died, either from illness or as the result of being
poisoned. Seneca realized that his days at court were numbered,
and he attempted to retire from politics, pleading ill health and
old age. Nero ﬁnally agreed to let him retire, but the retirement was short-lived. The counselors who replaced Seneca
convinced Nero that Seneca had been involved in a conspiracy
against him, and in 65, Nero ordered Seneca’s death.
When the friends who were present at his execution wept
over his fate, Seneca chastised them. What, he asked, had
become of their Stoicism? He then embraced his wife. The
arteries in his arms were slit, but because of age and inﬁrmity,
he bled slowly, so the arteries of his legs and knees were also
severed. Still he did not die. He asked a friend to bring poison,
which he drank but without fatal consequences. He was then
carried into a bath, the steam of which suffocated him.5
Seneca’s essay “On the Happy Life” was written for his elder
brother Gallio—the same Gallio, by the way, as is mentioned
in Acts 18:12–16 of the New Testament for his refusal to
try St. Paul in Corinth. In this essay, Seneca explains how
best to pursue tranquility. Basically, we need to use our
reasoning ability to drive away “all that excites or affrights
us.” If we can do this, there will ensue “unbroken tranquility
and enduring freedom,” and we will experience “a boundless joy that is ﬁrm and unalterable.” Indeed, he claims (as
we have seen) that someone who practices Stoic principles
“must, whether he wills or not, necessarily be attended by

48 The Rise of Stoicism

constant cheerfulness and a joy that is deep and issues from
deep within, since he ﬁnds delight in his own resources, and
desires no joys greater than his inner joys.” Furthermore,
compared to these joys, pleasures of the ﬂesh are “paltry and
trivial and ﬂeeting.”6
Elsewhere, we ﬁnd Seneca telling his friend Lucilius that if
he wishes to practice Stoicism, he will have to make it his business to “learn how to feel joy.” He adds that one of the reasons
he wants Lucilius to practice Stoicism is because he does not
wish Lucilius “ever to be deprived of gladness.”7 Those who
are accustomed to thinking of the Stoics as a glum bunch
might be surprised by such comments, but these and other
remarks make it clear that the phrase “joyful Stoic” is not an
oxymoron.8
Gaius Musonius Rufus, the least well-known of the four
great Roman Stoics, was born in around 30 ad. Because of
his family’s standing, Musonius could have gone far in politics, but instead he started a school of philosophy. We know
little about Musonius in part because he, like Socrates, didn’t
bother to write down his philosophical thoughts. Fortunately,
Musonius had a pupil, Lucius, who took notes during lectures.
In these notes, Lucius often begins by talking about what
“he,” Musonius, said in response to some question. It therefore seems likely that the lectures Musonius gave in his school
weren’t monologues; rather, he carried on a two-way Socratic
conversation with his students. It is also likely that Musonius
used these conversations both to instruct his students and to
assess their philosophical progress.

Roman Stoicism 49

Musonius was at the height of his fame and inﬂuence at
the time of Emperor Nero. He apparently aligned himself
with Nero’s enemies—or rather, with people Nero took to be
enemies. Nero had him imprisoned and subsequently banished
him. (According to Tacitus, the real reason Nero banished
Musonius was his envy of Musonius’s fame as a philosopher.)9
Musonius’s banishment was particularly brutal, as banishments go. In 65 ad, he was sent to the island of Gyara (or
Gyaros) in the Cyclades, a group of islands in the Aegean Sea
southeast of Greece. The island was desolate, bleak, rocky, and
nearly waterless. The Greek geographer and historian Strabo
describes it as “worthless,”10 and Seneca mentions it in his list
of the worst places on which to be exiled.11 (This island, interestingly, was still being used as a place of banishment in the
twentieth century; it is where the Greek generals sent their
political opponents in the early 1970s.)12
On being exiled, though, Musonius did not fall into despair.
He instead took an interest in Gyara and its inhabitants,
mostly ﬁshermen. He soon discovered a spring on the island
and thereby made it more habitable. And whatever loneliness
he might have experienced there was relieved by an inﬂux of
philosophical disciples.
After Nero’s death, Musonius returned to Rome. Not long
thereafter, Emperor Vespasian banished all philosophers from
Rome but seems to have exempted Musonius.13 Later, though,
Musonius was again exiled. He died in around 100 ad.
According to Musonius, we should study philosophy, since
how otherwise could we hope to live well?14 Furthermore, he

50 The Rise of Stoicism

says that studying philosophy should affect us personally and
profoundly; indeed, when a philosopher lectures, his words
should make those in his audience shudder and feel ashamed,
and when he is done speaking, they should, rather than
applauding him, have been reduced to silence.15 According to
Epictetus, Musonius himself apparently possessed the ability to
reduce his audiences to silence, for when he spoke, his listeners
felt as if he had discovered and laid before them those traits of
which they were secretly ashamed.16
Musonius also thought the practice of philosophy required
one not to withdraw from the world, as the Epicureans advised,
but to be a vigorous participant in public affairs. Musonius
therefore taught his students how to retain their Stoic tranquility while participating.
Besides thinking that philosophy should be practical,
Musonius thought the study of philosophy should be universal.
Indeed, he argued that both women and men “have received
from the gods the same reasoning power.” Consequently,
women, like men, can beneﬁt from education and the study
of philosophy.17 Because he held these views when he did,
Musonius has been applauded by modern feminists.
Epictetus, the most famous of Musonius’s students, was
born into slavery sometime between 50 and 60 ad. He was
subsequently acquired by Epaphroditus, secretary to Emperor
Nero and later to Domitian. This must have given Epictetus
exposure to the imperial court.18 It also meant that Epictetus,
although a slave, was a “white-collar” slave. Romans valued
those slaves who showed signs of intelligence and initiative.

Roman Stoicism 51

They trained them so they could make the best use of their
gifts, and they subsequently put their slaves to work as teachers,
counselors, and administrators.
Epictetus appears to have developed an interest in philosophy early in life. As a youth, we are told, he went around
asking people whether their souls were healthy. If they ignored
him, he persisted in questioning them until they threatened to
beat him.19 This behavior, to be sure, suggests that Epictetus
had initially been drawn to Cynicism rather than Stoicism;
the Cynics, as we have seen, proselytized in a manner that
the Stoics did not. Even in his mature philosophy, we can ﬁnd
evidence of his respect for the Cynics.
After the death of Nero, Epictetus apparently gained
freedom. He started a school of philosophy but was subsequently banished, along with all the other philosophers in
Rome, by Domitian. He moved his school to Nicopolis, in what
is now western Greece. After the assassination of Domitian,
Stoicism regained its respectability and even became fashionable among Romans. Epictetus was by then the leading
Stoic teacher. He could have moved back to Rome but chose
instead to remain in Nicopolis. His school, despite its location,
attracted students from around the Roman Empire.
According to the classicist Anthony A. Long, Epictetus
expected his pupils to satisfy two conditions: “(1) wanting to
beneﬁt from philosophy and (2) understanding what a commitment to philosophy entails.”20 Epictetus knew that his words
would be wasted on students who didn’t yet recognize their
own inadequacies or who weren’t willing to take the steps
necessary to deal with them. He describes his ideal pupil as

52 The Rise of Stoicism

someone who will be satisﬁed if he can “live untrammelled
and untroubled,” as someone who seeks to be “tranquil and
free from turmoil.”21
What these students could expect at one of Epictetus’s
lectures was not a one-way communication, from Epictetus
to his students, about esoteric philosophical theories. To the
contrary, he wanted his students to take his lectures personally.
He wanted his remarks to strike close to home. He therefore
told his students that a Stoic school should be like a physician’s
consulting room and that patients should leave feeling bad
rather than feeling good,22 the idea being that any treatment
likely to cure a patient is also likely to cause him discomfort.
His lectures were therefore, according to Long, “dialectical
lessons—invitations to his audience to examine themselves.”23
According to Epictetus, the primary concern of philosophy
should be the art of living: Just as wood is the medium of the
carpenter and bronze is the medium of the sculptor, your
life is the medium on which you practice the art of living.24
Furthermore, much as a master carpenter teaches an apprentice by showing him techniques that can be used to build things
out of wood, Epictetus taught his students the art of life by
showing them techniques that could be used to make something of their life. The techniques in question were quite practical and completely applicable to students’ everyday lives. He
taught them, among other things, how to respond to insults,
how to deal with incompetent servants, how to deal with
an angry brother, how to deal with the loss of a loved one,
and how to deal with exile. If they could master these techniques, Epictetus promised, they would experience a life that

Roman Stoicism 53

was ﬁlled with purpose and dignity, and more important, they
would attain tranquility. Furthermore, they would retain their
dignity and tranquility regardless of the hardships life might
subsequently inﬂict on them.
Those who read Epictetus cannot help but notice his frequent
mention of religion. Indeed, Zeus is mentioned more than
anyone except Socrates. To better understand the role Zeus
plays in Stoicism, consider the situation of a prospective pupil
at Epictetus’s school. If this person asked what one must do
to practice Stoicism, Epictetus might describe the various
techniques Stoics advocate. If he asked why he should practice these techniques, Epictetus might reply that doing so will
enable him to attain tranquility.
So far, so good, but suppose this student had looked at other
schools of philosophy and wondered why Epictetus’s school was
better than they were. Suppose, more precisely, he asked Epictetus
what reason there was to think that the techniques advocated by
the Stoics would enable him to attain tranquility. In his response
to this question, Epictetus would start talking about Zeus.
We were, he would tell the student, created by Zeus. His
student was likely to accept this claim, inasmuch as atheism
appears to have been a rarity in ancient Rome. (Then again,
what Epictetus had in mind when he referred to Zeus is probably
different from what most Romans had in mind. In particular, it
is possible that Epictetus identiﬁed Zeus with Nature.)25 Epictetus
would go on to explain that Zeus made us different from other
animals in one important respect: We are rational, as are the gods.
We are therefore a curious hybrid, half-animal and half-god.

54 The Rise of Stoicism

Zeus, as it so happens, is a thoughtful, kind, and loving
god, and when he created us, he had our best interests in
mind. But sadly, he appears not to have been omnipotent, so
in creating us, there were limits to what he could do. In his
Discourses, Epictetus imagines having a conversation with
Zeus, in which Zeus explains his predicament in the following
terms: “Epictetus, had it been possible I should have made
both this paltry body and this small estate of thine free and
unhampered. . . . Yet since I could not give thee this, we have
given thee a certain portion of ourself, this faculty of choice
and refusal, of desire and aversion.” He adds that if Epictetus
learns to make proper use of this faculty, he will never feel frustrated or dissatisﬁed.26 He will, in other words, retain his tranquility—and even experience joy—despite the blows Fortune
might deal him.
Elsewhere in the Discourses, Epictetus suggests that even
if Zeus could have made us “free and unhampered,” he would
have chosen not to do so. Epictetus presents us with the image
of Zeus as an athletic coach: “It is difﬁculties that show what men
are. Consequently, when a difﬁculty befalls, remember that God,
like a physical trainer, has matched you with a rugged young
man.” Why do this? To toughen and strengthen you, so you can
become “an Olympic victor”27—in other words, so you can have
the best life possible. Seneca, by the way, argued along similar
lines: God, he said, “does not make a spoiled pet of a good man;
he tests him, hardens him, and ﬁts him for his own service.” In
particular, the adversities we experience count as “mere training,”
and “those things which we all shudder and tremble at are for the
good of the persons themselves to whom they come.”28

Roman Stoicism 55

Epictetus would then tell the prospective student that if he
wishes to have a good life, he must consider his nature and the
purpose for which God created him and live accordingly; he
must, as Zeno put it, live in accordance with nature. The person
who does this won’t simply pursue pleasure, as an animal might;
instead, he will use his reasoning ability to reﬂect on the human
condition. He will then discover the reason we were created and
the role we play in the cosmic scheme. He will realize that to have
a good life, he needs to perform well the function of a human
being, the function Zeus designed him to fulﬁll. He will therefore
pursue virtue, in the ancient sense of the word, meaning that
he will strive to become an excellent human being. He will also
come to realize that if he lives in accordance with nature, he will
be rewarded with the tranquility that Zeus promised us.
This explanation might have satisﬁed people in Epictetus’s
time, but it is likely to be off-putting to modern individuals,
almost none of whom believe in the existence of Zeus, and
many of whom don’t believe we were created by a divine being
who wanted what was best for us. Many readers will therefore, at this point, be thinking, “If I have to believe in Zeus and
divine creation to practice Stoicism, then Stoicism is for me a
nonstarter.” Readers should therefore realize that it is entirely
possible to practice Stoicism—and in particular, to employ
Stoic strategies for attaining tranquility—without believing in
Zeus or, for that matter, in divine creation. In chapter 20 I will
have more to say about how this can be done.
“Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting
with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and

56 The Rise of Stoicism

selﬁshness—all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of
what is good or evil.”29 These words were written not by a slave
like Epictetus, whom we would naturally expect to encounter
insolence and ill will; they were written by the person who
was at the time the most powerful man in the world: Marcus
Aurelius, emperor of Rome.
Because he was someone important, we know more about
Marcus than about any of the other Roman Stoics. We also
have an unusual degree of insight into his inner thoughts,
thanks to the correspondence he carried on with his tutor
Cornelius Fronto and thanks, also, to his Meditations, in which
he reﬂects on life and his response to it.
Marcus was born in 121. He appears to have taken an interest
in philosophy at an early age. One biographer describes him
as a “solemn child” and relates that “as soon as he passed
beyond the age when children are brought up under the
care of nurses, he was handed over to advanced instructors
and attained to a knowledge of philosophy.”30 At age twelve
Marcus was taught by the painter and philosopher Diognetus,
and he started experimenting with what sounds like Cynicism:
He wore crude clothing and started sleeping on the ground.31
His mother subsequently talked him into sleeping instead on a
couch strewn with skins.32
As a teenager, Marcus studied with the Stoic philosopher Apollonius of Chalcedon. According to Marcus, it was
Apollonius who impressed on him the need to be decisive and
reasonable, taught him how to combine days full of intense
activity with periods of relaxation, and taught him how,
“with the same unaltered composure,” to withstand sickness

Roman Stoicism 57

and pain—and in particular, Marcus notes, how to withstand
the mental anguish he later experienced on losing a son.
Another important inﬂuence on Marcus was Quintus Junius
Rusticus, who, signiﬁcantly, lent Marcus a copy of Epictetus’s
Discourses.33 Epictetus subsequently became the single most
important inﬂuence on Marcus.
Like Epictetus, Marcus was far more interested in Stoic
ethics—in, that is, its philosophy of life—than in Stoic physics
or logic. Indeed, in the Meditations he asserts that it is possible
to achieve “freedom, self-respect, unselﬁshness, and obedience
to the will of God” even though we have not mastered logic
and physics.34
When Marcus was sixteen, Emperor Hadrian adopted
Marcus’s maternal uncle, Antoninus, who in turn adopted
Marcus. (Marcus’s father had died when Marcus was quite
young.) From the time Marcus entered palace life, he had
political power, and when Antoninus became emperor, Marcus
served as virtual co-emperor. He didn’t let this power go to his
head, though; during the thirteen years he acted as Antoninus’s
chief lieutenant, he did not give people the impression that
he longed for sole rule.35 Furthermore, when Antoninus died
and Marcus gained power, he appointed Lucius Verus joint
emperor. This was the ﬁrst time the Roman Empire had two
emperors.36
As Roman emperors go, Marcus was exceptionally good.
For one thing, he exercised great restraint in his use of
power. No emperor, we are told, showed more respect to the
Senate than Marcus did. He took care not to waste public

58 The Rise of Stoicism

money.37 And although he didn’t need to ask the Senate for
permission to spend money, he routinely did so, and in one
speech reminded them that the imperial palace in which he
lived was not his but theirs.38 To ﬁnance wars, he auctioned
off imperial possessions, including statues, paintings, gold
vases, and some of his wife’s jewelry and clothing rather than
raise taxes.39
Marcus, wrote the historian Edward Gibbon, was the last of
the Five Good Emperors (the other four being Nerva, Trajan,
Hadrian, and Antoninus) who ruled from 96–180 and brought
about “the period in the history of the world during which
the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous.”40 This period, writes the nineteenth-century historian
W. E. H. Lecky, “exhibits a uniformity of good government
which no other despotic monarchy has equalled. Each of the
ﬁve emperors who then reigned deserves to be placed among
the best rulers who have ever lived.”41 Marcus is, in other
words, a rare example of a philosopher king and perhaps the
only example of a philosopher whom subjects wanted to have
as their king.
Like the other Roman Stoics, Marcus didn’t feel compelled
to prove that tranquility was worth pursuing. To the contrary,
he thought its value was obvious. And if someone had told
Marcus that he thought mortal life could offer something better
than “peace of mind,” Marcus would not have attempted to
persuade him otherwise; instead he would have advised this
individual to turn to the thing in question “with your whole
soul, and rejoice in the prize you have found.”42

Roman Stoicism 59

As an adult, Marcus was in great need of the tranquility
Stoicism could offer. He was sick, possibly with an ulcer.
His family life was a source of distress: His wife appears to
have been unfaithful to him, and of the at least fourteen
children she bore him, only six survived. Added to this were
the stresses that came with ruling an empire. During his
reign, there were numerous frontier uprisings, and Marcus
often went personally to oversee campaigns against upstart
tribes. His own ofﬁcials—most notably, Avidius Cassius, the
governor of Syria—rebelled against him.43 His subordinates
were insolent to him, which insolence he bore with “an
unrufﬂed temper.”44 Citizens told jokes at his expense and
were not punished for doing so. During his reign, the empire
also experienced plague, famine, and natural disasters such as
the earthquake at Smyrna.45 It is therefore with good reason
that Marcus observed, in his Meditations, that “the art of
living is more like wrestling than dancing.”46
The Roman historian Cassius Dio summarized Marcus’s
plight as follows: “He did not meet with the good fortune that
he deserved, for he was not strong in body and was involved
in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire
reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very
reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difﬁculties he
both survived himself and preserved the empire.” Dio adds
that from his ﬁrst days as counselor to Antoninus to his last
days as emperor, “he remained the same and did not change
in the least.”47
In 180, Marcus became seriously ill. He refused to eat or
drink in an attempt to hurry death.48 He died on March 17 of

60

The Rise of Stoicism

that year, at age ﬁfty-eight. His death provoked an outburst of
public grief. His soldiers in particular were deeply moved by his
passing.49
In much the same way as Roman Emperor Constantine’s
conversion was a boon for Christianity, Marcus’s Stoicism
could have been a boon for that philosophy. Marcus, however,
did not preach Stoicism. He did not lecture his fellow Romans
on the beneﬁts of practicing Stoicism; nor did he expose them
to his philosophical writings. (The Meditations was a private
journal—the original title was To Himself—and was published
only after Marcus’s death.) And although Marcus’s interest in
Stoicism seems to have led many Romans to self-identify as
Stoics, presumably to curry favor with him,50 it did not trigger a
widespread interest in the philosophy. In a sense, then, Marcus
represents the high-water mark of Stoicism.
That Stoicism has seen better days is obvious. Have you, in
the course of your life, encountered even one practicing Stoic?
It is tempting to attribute this decline in popularity to some
ﬂaw in the Stoic philosophy. I would like to suggest, though,
that the unpopularity of Stoicism is due not to a defect in the
philosophy but to other factors. For one thing, modern individuals rarely see the need to adopt a philosophy of life. They
instead tend to spend their days working hard to be able to
afford the latest consumer gadget, in the resolute belief that
if only they buy enough stuff, they will have a life that is both
meaningful and maximally fulﬁlling. Furthermore, even if it
dawns on these individuals that there is more to life than shopping, they are unlikely, in their pursuit of a philosophy of life,
to turn to Stoicism. Either they have no idea at all what they

Roman Stoicism 61

would have to do to practice Stoicism, or—more likely—they
have the wrong idea.
Allow me, therefore, as part of my attempt to reanimate
Stoicism, to explain, in the chapters that follow, what, exactly,
is involved in the practice of this philosophy.

Negative Visualization
What’s the Worst That Can Happen?

Any thoughtful person will periodically contemplate the
bad things that can happen to him. The obvious reason for
doing this is to prevent those things from happening. Someone
might, for example, spend time thinking about ways people
could break into his home so he can prevent them from doing
so. Or he might spend time thinking about the diseases that
might afﬂict him so he can take preventive measures.
But no matter how hard we try to prevent bad things from
happening to us, some will happen anyway. Seneca therefore
points to a second reason for contemplating the bad things that
can happen to us. If we think about these things, we will lessen
their impact on us when, despite our efforts at prevention, they
happen: “He robs present ills of their power who has perceived
their coming beforehand.”1 Misfortune weighs most heavily, he
says, on those who “expect nothing but good fortune.”2 Epictetus
echoes this advice: We should keep in mind that “all things everywhere are perishable.” If we fail to recognize this and instead go
around assuming that we will always be able to enjoy the things
we value, we will likely ﬁnd ourselves subject to considerable
distress when the things we value are taken from us.3

66

Stoic Psychological Techniques

Besides these reasons for contemplating the bad things that
can happen to us, there is a third and arguably much more
important reason. We humans are unhappy in large part
because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we
want, we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire.
Rather than feeling satisﬁed, we feel a bit bored, and in response
to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires.
The psychologists Shane Frederick and George Loewenstein
have studied this phenomenon and given it a name: hedonic
adaptation. To illustrate the adaptation process, they point to
studies of lottery winners. Winning a lottery typically allows
someone to live the life of his dreams. It turns out, though,
that after an initial period of exhilaration, lottery winners end
up about as happy as they previously were.4 They start taking
their new Ferrari and mansion for granted, the way they previously took their rusted-out pickup and cramped apartment for
granted.
Another, less dramatic form of hedonic adaptation takes
place when we make consumer purchases. Initially, we
delight in the wide-screen television or ﬁne leather handbag
we bought. After a time, though, we come to despise them
and ﬁnd ourselves longing for an even wider-screen television
or an even more extravagant handbag. Likewise, we experience hedonic adaptation in our career. We might once have
dreamed of getting a certain job. We might consequently have
worked hard in college and maybe graduate school as well
to get on the proper career path, and on that path, we might
have spent years making slow but steady progress toward our
career goal. On ﬁnally landing the job of our dreams, we will

Negative Visualization 67

be delighted, but before long we are likely to grow dissatisﬁed.
We will grumble about our pay, our coworkers, and the failure
of our boss to recognize our talents.
We also experience hedonic adaptation in our relationships.
We meet the man or woman of our dreams, and after a tumultuous courtship succeed in marrying this person. We start out
in a state of wedded bliss, but before long we ﬁnd ourselves
contemplating our spouse’s flaws and, not long after that,
fantasizing about starting a relationship with someone new.
As a result of the adaptation process, people ﬁnd themselves
on a satisfaction treadmill. They are unhappy when they detect
an unfulﬁlled desire within them. They work hard to fulﬁll this
desire, in the belief that on fulﬁlling it, they will gain satisfaction. The problem, though, is that once they fulﬁll a desire for
something, they adapt to its presence in their life and as a result
stop desiring it—or at any rate, don’t ﬁnd it as desirable as they
once did. They end up just as dissatisﬁed as they were before
fulﬁlling the desire.
One key to happiness, then, is to forestall the adaptation
process: We need to take steps to prevent ourselves from taking
for granted, once we get them, the things we worked so hard
to get. And because we have probably failed to take such steps
in the past, there are doubtless many things in our life to which
we have adapted, things that we once dreamed of having but
that we now take for granted, including, perhaps, our spouse,
our children, our house, our car, and our job.
This means that besides ﬁnding a way to forestall the adaptation process, we need to ﬁnd a way to reverse it. In other words,
we need a technique for creating in ourselves a desire for the

68

Stoic Psychological Techniques

things we already have. Around the world and throughout the
millennia, those who have thought carefully about the workings of desire have recognized this—that the easiest way for us
to gain happiness is to learn how to want the things we already
have. This advice is easy to state and is doubtless true; the trick
is in putting it into practice in our life. How, after all, can we
convince ourselves to want the things we already have?
The stoics thought they had an answer to this question.
They recommended that we spend time imagining that we
have lost the things we value—that our wife has left us, our car
was stolen, or we lost our job. Doing this, the Stoics thought,
will make us value our wife, our car, and our job more than we
otherwise would. This technique—let us refer to it as negative
visualization—was employed by the Stoics at least as far back
as Chrysippus.5 It is, I think, the single most valuable technique
in the Stoics’ psychological tool kit.
Seneca describes the negative visualization technique in the
consolation he wrote to Marcia, a woman who, three years
after the death of her son, was as grief-stricken as on the day
she buried him. In this consolation, besides telling Marcia how
to overcome her current grief, Seneca offers advice on how
she can avoid falling victim to such grief in the future: What
she needs to do is anticipate the events that can cause her to
grieve. In particular, he says, she should remember that all we
have is “on loan” from Fortune, which can reclaim it without
our permission—indeed, without even advance notice. Thus,
“we should love all of our dear ones . . . , but always with the
thought that we have no promise that we may keep them

Negative Visualization 69

forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for
long.”6 While enjoying the companionship of loved ones, then,
we should periodically stop to reﬂect on the possibility that
this enjoyment will come to an end. If nothing else, our own
death will end it.
Epictetus also advocates negative visualization. He counsels
us, for example, when we kiss our child, to remember that she
is mortal and not something we own—that she has been given
to us “for the present, not inseparably nor for ever.” His advice:
In the very act of kissing the child, we should silently reﬂect on
the possibility that she will die tomorrow.7 In his Meditations,
by the way, Marcus Aurelius approvingly quotes this advice.8
To see how imagining the death of a child can make us
appreciate her, consider two fathers. The ﬁrst takes Epictetus’s
advice to heart and periodically reﬂects on his child’s mortality.
The second refuses to entertain such gloomy thoughts. He
instead assumes that his child will outlive him and that she will
always be around for him to enjoy. The ﬁrst father will almost
certainly be more attentive and loving than the second. When
he sees his daughter ﬁrst thing in the morning, he will be glad
that she is still a part of his life, and during the day he will
take full advantage of opportunities to interact with her. The
second father, in contrast, will be unlikely to experience a rush
of delight on encountering his child in the morning. Indeed, he
might not even look up from the newspaper to acknowledge
her presence in the room. During the day, he will fail to take
advantage of opportunities to interact with her in the belief
that such interactions can be postponed until tomorrow. And
when he ﬁnally does get around to interacting with her, the

70

Stoic Psychological Techniques

delight he derives from her company will not be as profound,
one supposes, as the delight the ﬁrst father experiences from
such interactions.
Besides contemplating the death of relatives, the Stoics
think we should spend time contemplating the loss of friends,
to death, perhaps, or to a falling-out. Thus, Epictetus counsels that when we say good-bye to a friend, we should silently
remind ourselves that this might be our ﬁnal parting.9 If we do
this, we will be less likely to take our friends for granted, and as
a result, we will probably derive far more pleasure from friendships than we otherwise would.
Among the deaths we should contemplate, says Epictetus,
is our own.10 Along similar lines, Seneca advises his friend
Lucilius to live each day as if it were his last. Indeed, Seneca
takes things even further than this: We should live as if this
very moment were our last.11
What does it mean to live each day as if it were our last?
Some people assume that it means living wildly and engaging
in all sorts of hedonistic excess. After all, if this day is our
last, we will not pay any price for our riotous living. We can
use drugs without fear of becoming addicted. We can likewise spend money with reckless abandon without having to
worry about how we will pay the bills that will come to us
tomorrow.
This, however, is not what the Stoics had in mind when
they advise us to live as if today were our last day. To them,
living as if each day were our last is simply an extension of
the negative visualization technique: As we go about our day,

Negative Visualization 71

we should periodically pause to reﬂect on the fact that we will
not live forever and therefore that this day could be our last.
Such reﬂection, rather than converting us into hedonists, will
make us appreciate how wonderful it is that we are alive and
have the opportunity to ﬁll this day with activity. This in turn
will make it less likely that we will squander our days. In other
words, when the Stoics counsel us to live each day as if it were
our last, their goal is not to change our activities but to change
our state of mind as we carry out those activities. In particular, they don’t want us to stop thinking about or planning for
tomorrow; instead they want us, as we think about and plan
for tomorrow, to remember to appreciate today.
Why, then, do the Stoics want us to contemplate our own
death? Because doing so can dramatically enhance our enjoyment of life.
And besides contemplating the loss of our life, say the
Stoics, we should contemplate the loss of our possessions.
Most of us spend our idle moments thinking about the things
we want but don’t have. We would be much better off, Marcus
says, to spend this time thinking of all the things we have and
reﬂecting on how much we would miss them if they were not
ours.12 Along these lines, we should think about how we would
feel if we lost our material possessions, including our house,
car, clothing, pets, and bank balance; how we would feel if we
lost our abilities, including our ability to speak, hear, walk,
breathe, and swallow; and how we would feel if we lost our
freedom.
Most of us are “living the dream”—living, that is, the dream
we once had for ourselves. We might be married to the person

72

Stoic Psychological Techniques

we once dreamed of marrying, have the children and job we
once dreamed of having, and own the car we once dreamed of
buying. But thanks to hedonic adaptation, as soon as we ﬁnd
ourselves living the life of our dreams, we start taking that life
for granted. Instead of spending our days enjoying our good
fortune, we spend them forming and pursuing new, grander
dreams for ourselves. As a result, we are never satisﬁed with
our life. Negative visualization can help us avoid this fate.
But what about those individuals who clearly aren’t living
the dream? What about a homeless person, for example? The
important thing to realize is that Stoicism is by no means a
rich person’s philosophy. Those who enjoy a comfortable and
afﬂuent life can beneﬁt from the practice of Stoicism, but so
can those who are impoverished. In particular, although their
poverty will prevent them from doing many things, it will not
preclude them from practicing negative visualization.
Consider the person who has been reduced to possession of
only a loincloth. His circumstances could be worse: He could
lose the loincloth. He would do well, say the Stoics, to reﬂect
on this possibility. Suppose, then, that he loses his loincloth. As
long as he retains his health, his circumstances could again be
worse—a point worth considering. And if his health deteriorates? He can be thankful that he is still alive.
It is hard to imagine a person who could not somehow be
worse off. It is therefore hard to imagine a person who could
not beneﬁt from the practice of negative visualization. The
claim is not that practicing it will make life as enjoyable for
those who have nothing as it is for those who have much. The

Negative Visualization 73

claim is merely that the practice of negative visualization—and
more generally, the adoption of Stoicism—can take some of
the sting out of having nothing and thereby make those who
have nothing less miserable than they would otherwise be.
Along these lines, consider the plight of James Stockdale. (If
the name rings a bell, it is probably because he was Ross Perot’s
running mate in the 1992 campaign for president of the United
States.) A navy pilot, Stockdale was shot down over Vietnam in
1965 and held as a prisoner of war until 1973. During that time,
he experienced poor health, primitive living conditions, and
the brutality of his jailers. And yet he not only survived but
emerged an unbroken man. How did he manage it? In large
part, he says, by practicing Stoicism.13
One other thing to realize: Although they offer downtrodden people advice on how to make their existence more
tolerable, the Stoics are by no means in favor of keeping these
people in their state of subjugation. The Stoics would work to
improve their external circumstances, but at the same time,
the Stoics would suggest things they could do to alleviate their
misery until those circumstances are improved.
One might imagine that the Stoics, because they go around
contemplating worst-case scenarios, would tend toward pessimism. What we ﬁnd, though, is that the regular practice of
negative visualization has the effect of transforming Stoics into
full-blown optimists. Allow me to explain.
We normally characterize an optimist as someone who sees
his glass as being half full rather than half empty. For a Stoic,
though, this degree of optimism would only be a starting

74 Stoic Psychological Techniques

point. After expressing his appreciation that his glass is half full
rather than being completely empty, he will go on to express
his delight in even having a glass: It could, after all, have been
broken or stolen. And if he is atop his Stoic game, he might go
on to comment about what an astonishing thing glass vessels
are: They are cheap and fairly durable, impart no taste to what
we put in them, and—miracle of miracles!—allow us to see
what they contain. This might sound a bit silly, but to someone
who has not lost his capacity for joy, the world is a wonderful
place. To such a person, glasses are amazing; to everyone else,
a glass is just a glass, and it is half empty to boot.
Hedonic adaptation has the power to extinguish our enjoyment of the world. Because of adaptation, we take our life
and what we have for granted rather than delighting in them.
Negative visualization, though, is a powerful antidote to hedonic
adaptation. By consciously thinking about the loss of what we
have, we can regain our appreciation of it, and with this regained
appreciation we can revitalize our capacity for joy.
One reason children are capable of joy is because they take
almost nothing for granted. To them, the world is wonderfully new and surprising. Not only that, but they aren’t yet
sure how the world works: Perhaps the things they have today
will mysteriously vanish tomorrow. It is hard for them to
take something for granted when they can’t even count on its
continued existence.
But as children grow older, they grow jaded. By the time
they are teenagers, they are likely to take almost everything
and everyone around them for granted. They might grumble
about having to live the life they are living, in the home they

Negative Visualization 75

happen to inhabit, with the parents and siblings they happen to
have. And in a frightening number of cases, these children grow
up to be adults who are not only unable to take delight in the
world around them but seem proud of this inability. They will,
at the drop of a hat, provide you with a long list of things about
themselves and their life that they dislike and wish they could
change, were it possible to do so, including their spouse, their
children, their house, their job, their car, their age, their bank
balance, their weight, the color of their hair, and the shape of
their navel. Ask them what they appreciate about the world—
ask them what, if anything, they are satisﬁed with—and they
might, after some thought, reluctantly name a thing or two.
Sometimes a catastrophe blasts these people out of their
jadedness. Suppose, for example, a tornado destroys their home.
Such events are tragic, of course, but at the same time they
potentially have a silver lining: Those who survive them might
come to appreciate whatever they still possess. More generally,
war, disease, and natural disasters are tragic, inasmuch as they
take from us the things we value, but they also have the power
to transform those who experience them. Before, these individuals might have been sleepwalking through life; now they are
joyously, thankfully alive—as alive as they have felt in decades.
Before, they might have been indifferent to the world around
them; now they are alert to the world’s beauty.
Catastrophe-induced personal transformations have drawbacks, though. The ﬁrst is that you can’t count on being struck
by a catastrophe. Indeed, many people have a catastrophefree—and as a consequence, joyless—life. (Ironically, it is

76

Stoic Psychological Techniques

these people’s misfortune to have a life that is blessedly free
of misfortune.) A second drawback is that catastrophes that
have the power to transform someone can also take his life.
Consider, for example, a passenger on an airliner, the engines
of which have just burst into ﬂames. This turn of events is
likely to cause the passenger to reassess his life, and as a
result, he might ﬁnally gain some insight into what things in
life are truly valuable and what things are not. Unfortunately,
moments after this epiphany he might be dead.
The third drawback to catastrophe-induced transformations is that the states of joy they trigger tend to wear off.
Those who come close to dying but subsequently revive typically regain their zest for living. They might, for example,
feel motivated to contemplate the sunsets they had previously ignored or to engage in heartfelt conversations with the
spouse they had previously taken for granted. They do this for
a time, but then, in all too many cases, apathy returns: They
might ignore the gorgeous sunset that is blazing outside their
window in order to complain bitterly to their spouse that there
is nothing worth watching on television.
Negative visualization does not have these drawbacks. We
don’t have to wait to engage in negative visualization the way
we have to wait to be struck by a catastrophe. Being struck
by a catastrophe can easily kill us; engaging in negative visualization can’t. And because negative visualization can be
done repeatedly, its beneﬁcial effects, unlike those of a catastrophe, can last indeﬁnitely. Negative visualization is therefore
a wonderful way to regain our appreciation of life and with it
our capacity for joy.

Negative Visualization 77

The Stoics are not alone in harnessing the power of negative
visualization. Consider, for example, those individuals who say
grace before a meal. Some presumably say it because they are
simply in the habit of doing so. Others might say it because
they fear that God will punish them if they don’t. But understood properly, saying grace—and for that matter, offering any
prayer of thanks—is a form of negative visualization. Before
eating a meal, those saying grace pause for a moment to reﬂect
on the fact that this food might not have been available to
them, in which case they would have gone hungry. And even
if the food were available, they might not have been able to
share it with the people now at their dinner table. Said with
these thoughts in mind, grace has the ability to transform an
ordinary meal into a cause for celebration.
Some people don’t need the Stoics or a priest to tell them
that the key to a cheerful disposition is periodically to entertain negative thoughts; they ﬁgured it out on their own. In the
course of my life, I have met many such people. They analyze
their circumstances not in terms of what they are lacking but
in terms of how much they have and how much they would
miss it were they to lose it. Many of them have been quite
unlucky, objectively speaking, in their life; nevertheless, they
will tell you at length how lucky they are—to be alive, to be
able to walk, to be living where they live, and so forth. It is
instructive to compare these people with those who, objectively speaking, “have it all,” but who, because they appreciate
none of what they have, are utterly miserable.
Earlier I mentioned that there are people who seem proud
of their inability to take delight in the world around them.

78

Stoic Psychological Techniques

They have somehow gotten the idea that by refusing to take
delight in the world, they are demonstrating their emotional
maturity: To take delight in things, they think, is childish. Or
maybe they have decided that it is fashionable to refuse to take
delight in the world, the way it is fashionable to refuse to wear
white after Labor Day, and they feel compelled to obey the
dictates of fashion. To refuse to take delight in the world, in
other words, is evidence of sophistication.
If you ask these malcontents for their opinion of the
cheerful people just described—or even worse, of those Stoic
optimists who go on at length about what a wonderful thing
glass is—they are likely to respond with disparaging remarks:
“Such people are clearly fools. They shouldn’t be satisﬁed
with so little. They should want more and not rest content
until they get it.” I would argue, though, that what is really
foolish is to spend your life in a state of self-induced dissatisfaction when satisfaction lies within your grasp, if only you
will change your mental outlook. To be able to be satisﬁed
with little is not a failing, it is a blessing—if, at any rate, what
you seek is satisfaction. And if you seek something other than
satisfaction, I would inquire (with astonishment) into what
it is that you ﬁnd more desirable than satisfaction. What,
I would ask, could possibly be worth sacriﬁcing satisfaction
in order to obtain?
If we have an active imagination, it will be easy for us
to engage in negative visualization; it will be easy for us to
imagine, for example, that our house has burned to the ground,
our boss has ﬁred us, or we have gone blind. If we have trouble

Negative Visualization 79

imagining such things, though, we can practice negative visualization by paying attention to the bad things that happen to
other people and reﬂecting on the fact that these things might
instead have happened to us.14 Alternatively, we can do some
historical research to see how our ancestors lived. We will
quickly discover that we are living in what to them would have
been a dream world—that we tend to take for granted things
that our ancestors had to live without, including antibiotics, air
conditioning, toilet paper(!), cell phones, television, windows,
eyeglasses, and fresh fruit in January. Upon coming to this
realization, we can breathe a sigh of relief that we aren’t our
ancestors, the way our descendants will presumably someday
breathe a sigh of relief that they aren’t us!
The negative visualization technique, by the way, can also
be used in reverse: Besides imagining that the bad things that
happened to others happen to us, we can imagine that the bad
things that happen to us happened instead to others. In his
Handbook, Epictetus advocates this sort of “projective visualization.” Suppose, he says, that our servant breaks a cup.15
We are likely to get angry and have our tranquility disrupted
by the incident. One way to avert this anger is to think about
how we would feel if the incident had happened to someone
else instead. If we were at someone’s house and his servant
broke a cup, we would be unlikely to get angry; indeed, we
might try to calm our host by saying “It’s just a cup; these
things happen.” Engaging in projective visualization, Epictetus
believes, will make us appreciate the relative insigniﬁcance of
the bad things that happen to us and will therefore prevent
them from disrupting our tranquility.

80

Stoic Psychological Techniques

At this point, a non-Stoic might raise the following objection.
The Stoics, as we have seen, advise us to pursue tranquility, and
as part of their strategy for attaining it they advise us to engage
in negative visualization. But isn’t this contradictory advice?
Suppose, for example, that a Stoic is invited to a picnic. While the
other picnickers are enjoying themselves, the Stoic will sit there,
quietly contemplating ways the picnic could be ruined: “Maybe
the potato salad is spoiled, and people will get food poisoning.
Maybe someone will break an ankle playing softball. Maybe there
will be a violent thunderstorm that will scatter the picnickers.
Maybe I will be struck by lightning and die.” This sounds like no
fun at all. But more to the point, it seems unlikely that a Stoic
will gain tranquility as a result of entertaining such thoughts.
To the contrary, he is likely to end up glum and anxiety-ridden.
In response to this objection, let me point out that it is a
mistake to think Stoics will spend all their time contemplating
potential catastrophes. It is instead something they will do
periodically: A few times each day or a few times each week
a Stoic will pause in his enjoyment of life to think about how
all this, all these things he enjoys, could be taken from him.
Furthermore, there is a difference between contemplating something bad happening and worrying about it.
Contemplation is an intellectual exercise, and it is possible for
us to conduct such exercises without its affecting our emotions.
It is possible, for example, for a meteorologist to spend her
days contemplating tornadoes without subsequently living in
dread of being killed by one. In similar fashion, it is possible
for a Stoic to contemplate bad things that can happen without
becoming anxiety-ridden as a result.

Negative Visualization 81

Finally, negative visualization, rather than making people
glum, will increase the extent to which they enjoy the world
around them, inasmuch as it will prevent them from taking that
world for granted. Despite—or rather, because of—his (occasional) gloomy thoughts, the Stoic will likely enjoy the picnic
far more than the other picnickers who refuse to entertain similarly gloomy thoughts; he will take delight in being part of an
event that, he fully realizes, might not have taken place.
The critic of Stoicism might now raise another concern.
If you don’t appreciate something, you won’t mind losing it.
But thanks to their ongoing practice of negative visualization,
the Stoics will be remarkably appreciative of the people and
things around them. Haven’t they thereby set themselves up
for heartache? Won’t they be deeply pained when life snatches
these people and things away, as it sometimes surely will?
Consider, by way of illustration, the two fathers mentioned
earlier. The ﬁrst father periodically contemplates the loss of
his child and therefore does not take her for granted; to the
contrary, he appreciates her very much. The second father
assumes that his child will always be there for him and therefore takes her for granted. It might be suggested that because
the second father does not appreciate his child, he will respond
to her death with a shrug of his shoulders, whereas the ﬁrst
father, because he deeply appreciates his child, has set himself
up for heartache if she dies.
Stoics, I think, would respond to this criticism by pointing out
that the second father almost certainly will grieve the loss of his
child: He will be full of regret for having taken her for granted.

82 Stoic Psychological Techniques

In particular, he is likely to be racked with “if only” thoughts: “If
only I had spent more time playing with her! If only I had told
her more bedtime stories! If only I had gone to her violin recitals
instead of going golﬁng!” The ﬁrst father, however, will not have
similar regrets; because he appreciated his daughter he will have
taken full advantage of opportunities to interact with her.
Make no mistake: The ﬁrst father will grieve the death of
his child. As we shall see, the Stoics think periodic episodes of
grief are part of the human condition. But at least this father
can take consolation in the knowledge that he spent well
what little time he had with his child. The second father will
have no such consolation and as a result might ﬁnd that his
feelings of grief are compounded by feelings of guilt. It is the
second father, I think, who has set himself up for heartache.
The Stoics would also respond to the above criticism by
observing that at the same time as the practice of negative visualization is helping us appreciate the world, it is preparing us for
changes in that world. To practice negative visualization, after
all, is to contemplate the impermanence of the world around us.
Thus, a father who practices negative visualization, if he does it
correctly, will come away with two conclusions: He is lucky to
have a child, and because he cannot be certain of her continued
presence in his life, he should be prepared to lose her.
This is why Marcus, immediately after advising readers
to spend time thinking about how much they would miss
their possessions if these possessions were lost, warns them
to “beware lest delight in them leads you to cherish them so
dearly that their loss would destroy your peace of mind.”16
Along similar lines, Seneca, after advising us to enjoy life,

Negative Visualization 83

cautions us not to develop “over-much love” for the things we
enjoy. To the contrary, we must take care to be “the user, but
not the slave, of the gifts of Fortune.”17
Negative visualization, in other words, teaches us to embrace
whatever life we happen to be living and to extract every bit
of delight we can from it. But it simultaneously teaches us to
prepare ourselves for changes that will deprive us of the things
that delight us. It teaches us, in other words, to enjoy what we
have without clinging to it. This in turn means that by practicing
negative visualization, we can not only increase our chances of
experiencing joy but increase the chance that the joy we experience will be durable, that it will survive changes in our circumstances. Thus, by practicing negative visualization, we can hope
to gain what Seneca took to be a primary beneﬁt of Stoicism,
namely, “a boundless joy that is ﬁrm and unalterable.”18
I mentioned in the introduction that some of the things
that attracted me to Buddhism could also be found in Stoicism.
Like Buddhists, Stoics advise us to contemplate the world’s
impermanence. “All things human,” Seneca reminds us, “are
short-lived and perishable.”19 Marcus likewise reminds us that
the things we treasure are like the leaves on a tree, ready to
drop when a breeze blows. He also argues that the “ﬂux and
change” of the world around us are not an accident but an
essential part of our universe.20
We need to keep ﬁrmly in mind that everything we value
and the people we love will someday be lost to us. If nothing
else, our own death will deprive us of them. More generally,
we should keep in mind that any human activity that cannot

84 Stoic Psychological Techniques

be carried on indeﬁnitely must have a ﬁnal occurrence. There
will be—or already has been!—a last time in your life that you
brush your teeth, cut your hair, drive a car, mow the lawn, or
play hopscotch. There will be a last time you hear the sound
of snow falling, watch the moon rise, smell popcorn, feel the
warmth of a child falling asleep in your arms, or make love.
You will someday eat your last meal, and soon thereafter you
will take your last breath.
Sometimes the world gives us advance notice that we are
about to do something for the last time. We might, for example,
eat at a favorite restaurant the night before it is scheduled to close,
orwe might kiss a lover who is forced by circumstances to move
to a distant part of the globe, presumably forever. Previously,
when we thought we could repeat them at will, a meal at this
restaurant or a kiss shared with our lover might have been unremarkable. But now that we know they cannot be repeated, they
will likely become extraordinary events: The meal will be the best
we ever had at the restaurant, and the parting kiss will be one of
the most intensely bittersweet experiences life has to offer.
By contemplating the impermanence of everything in
the world, we are forced to recognize that every time we do
something could be the last time we do it, and this recognition can invest the things we do with a significance and
intensity that would otherwise be absent. We will no longer
sleepwalk through our life. Some people, I realize, will ﬁnd
it depressing or even morbid to contemplate impermanence.
I am nevertheless convinced that the only way we can be truly
alive is if we make it our business periodically to entertain such
thoughts.

FIVE

The Dichotomy of Control
On Becoming Invincible

Our most important choice in life, according to Epictetus,
is whether to concern ourselves with things external to us or
things internal. Most people choose the former because they
think harms and benefits come from outside themselves.
According to Epictetus, though, a philosopher—by which he
means someone who has an understanding of Stoic philosophy—will do just the opposite. He will look “for all beneﬁt
and harm to come from himself.”1 In particular, he will give
up the rewards the external world has to offer in order to gain
“tranquility, freedom, and calm.”2
In offering this advice, Epictetus is turning the normal logic
of desire fulﬁllment on its head. If you ask most people how
to gain contentment, they will tell you that you must work
to get it: You must devise strategies by which to fulﬁll your
desires and then implement those strategies. But as Epictetus
points out, “It is impossible that happiness, and yearning for
what is not present, should ever be united.”3 A better strategy
for getting what you want, he says, is to make it your goal
to want only those things that are easy to obtain—and ideally to
want only those things that you can be certain of obtaining.

86

Stoic Psychological Techniques

While most people seek to gain contentment by changing
the world around them, Epictetus advises us to gain contentment by changing ourselves—more precisely, by changing
our desires. And he is not alone in giving this advice; indeed,
it is the advice offered by virtually every philosopher and
religious thinker who has reﬂected on human desire and the
causes of human dissatisfaction.4 They agree that if what
you seek is contentment, it is better and easier to change
yourself and what you want than it is to change the world
around you.
Your primary desire, says Epictetus, should be your desire
not to be frustrated by forming desires you won’t be able to
fulﬁll. Your other desires should conform to this desire, and if
they don’t, you should do your best to extinguish them. If you
succeed in doing this, you will no longer experience anxiety
about whether or not you will get what you want; nor will
you experience disappointment on not getting what you want.
Indeed, says Epictetus, you will become invincible: If you
refuse to enter contests that you are capable of losing, you will
never lose a contest.5
Epictetus’s Handbook opens, somewhat famously, with
the following assertion: “Some things are up to us and some
are not up to us.” He offers our opinions, impulses, desires,
and aversions as examples of things that are up to us, and our
possessions and reputation as examples of things that aren’t.6
From this assertion it follows that we are faced with a choice
in the desires we form: We can want things that are up to us,
or we can want things that are not up to us.

The Dichotomy of Control 87

If we want things that are not up to us, though, we will
sometimes fail to get what we want, and when this happens,
we will “meet misfortune” and feel “thwarted, miserable, and
upset.”7 In particular, Epictetus says, it is foolish for us to want
friends and relatives to live forever, since these are things that
aren’t up to us.8
Suppose we get lucky, and after wanting something that is
not up to us, we succeed in getting it. In this case, we will not
end up feeling “thwarted, miserable, and upset,” but during
the time we wanted the thing that is not up to us, we probably
experienced a degree of anxiety: Since the thing is not up to
us, there was a chance that we wouldn’t get it, and this probably worried us. Thus, wanting things that are not up to us
will disrupt our tranquility, even if we end up getting them. In
conclusion, whenever we desire something that is not up to us,
our tranquility will likely be disturbed: If we don’t get what we
want, we will be upset, and if we do get what we want, we will
experience anxiety in the process of getting it.
Consider again Epictetus’s “dichotomy of control”: He says
that some things are up to us and some things aren’t up to
us. The problem with this statement of the dichotomy is that
the phrase “some things aren’t up to us” is ambiguous: It can
be understood to mean either “There are things over which
we have no control at all ” or to mean “There are things over
which we don’t have complete control.” If we understand it in
the ﬁrst way, we can restate Epictetus’s dichotomy as follows:
There are things over which we have complete control and
things over which we have no control at all. But stated in this

88

Stoic Psychological Techniques

way, the dichotomy is a false dichotomy, since it ignores the
existence of things over which we have some but not complete
control.
Consider, for example, my winning a tennis match. This is
not something over which I have complete control: No matter
how much I practice and how hard I try, I might nevertheless
lose a match. Nor is it something over which I have no control
at all: Practicing a lot and trying hard may not guarantee that
I will win, but they will certainly affect my chances of winning.
My winning at tennis is therefore an example of something
over which I have some control but not complete control.
This suggests that we should understand the phrase “some
things aren’t up to us” in the second way: We should take it to
mean that there are things over which we don’t have complete
control. If we accept this interpretation, we will want to
restate Epictetus’s dichotomy of control as follows: There are
things over which we have complete control and things over
which we don’t have complete control. Stated in this way, the
dichotomy is a genuine dichotomy. Let us therefore assume
that this is what Epictetus meant in saying that “some things
are up to us and some things are not up to us.”
Now let us turn our attention to the second branch
of this dichotomy, to things over which we don’t have complete control. There are two ways we can fail to have complete
control over something: We might have no control at all over it,
or we might have some but not complete control. This means
that we can divide the category of things over which we don’t
have complete control into two subcategories: things over
which we have no control at all (such as whether the sun will

rise tomorrow) and things over which we have some but not
complete control (such as whether we win at tennis). This in
turn suggests the possibility of restating Epictetus’s dichotomy
of control as a trichotomy: There are things over which we
have complete control, things over which we have no control
at all, and things over which we have some but not complete
control. Each of the “things” we encounter in life will fall into
one and only one of these three categories.
In his statement of the dichotomy of control, Epictetus
suggests, quite sensibly, that we are behaving foolishly if
we spend time worrying about things that are not up to us;
because they are not up to us, worrying about them is futile.
We should instead concern ourselves with things that are up

90

Stoic Psychological Techniques

to us, since we can take steps either to bring them about or
prevent them from happening. On restating the dichotomy of
control as a trichotomy, though, we must restate his advice
regarding what is and isn’t sensible to worry about.
To begin with, it makes sense for us to spend time and
energy concerning ourselves with things over which we have
complete control. In these cases, our efforts will have guaranteed results. Notice, too, that because of the degree of control
we have over these things, it will generally require relatively
little time and energy for us to make sure they come about.
We would be foolish not to concern ourselves with them.
What are the things over which we have complete control?
In the passage quoted above, Epictetus says we have complete
control over our opinions, impulses, desires, and aversions.
I agree with Epictetus that we have complete control over
our opinions, as long as we properly construe the meaning of
opinion—more on this in a moment. I have qualms, though,
about including our impulses, desires, and aversions in the category of things over which we have complete control. I would
instead place them into the category of things over which we
have some but not complete control, or, in some cases, into the
category of things over which we have no control at all. Allow
me to explain why.
Suppose I am walking through a casino and, on passing a
roulette table, detect within me an impulse to place a bet that
the number 17 will come up on the next spin of the wheel.
I have a degree of control over whether I act on this impulse
but no control over whether it arises in me. (If something is
truly an impulse, we can’t preclude experiencing it.) The same

The Dichotomy of Control 91

can be said of many (but not all) of my desires. When I am on a
diet, for example, I might suddenly ﬁnd myself craving a bowl
of ice cream. I have a degree of control over whether I act on
this craving but no control over whether this craving spontaneously arises within me. Likewise, I can’t help it that I detect
within myself an aversion to spiders. I might, through an act
of sheer willpower, pick up and handle a tarantula despite this
aversion, but I can’t help it that I don’t like spiders.
These examples suggest that Epictetus is wrong to include
our impulses, desires, and aversions in the category of things
over which we have complete control. They belong instead
in the category of things over which we have some but not
complete control, or, in some instances, in the category of
things over which we have no control at all. But having said
this, I should add that it is possible that something important
has been lost in translation—that in speaking of impulses,
desires, and aversions, Epictetus had in mind something
different than we do.
What, then, are the things over which we have complete
control? To begin with, I think we have complete control over the
goals we set for ourselves. I have complete control, for example,
over whether my goal is to become the next pope, a millionaire,
or a monk in a Trappist monastery. Having said this, I should
add that although I have complete control over which of these
goals I set for myself, I obviously don’t have complete control
over whether I achieve any of them; my achieving the goals I
set for myself instead typically falls into the category of things
over which I have some but not complete control. Another thing

92 Stoic Psychological Techniques

I think we have complete control over is our values. We have
complete control, for example, over whether we value fame and
fortune, pleasure, or tranquility. Whether or not we live in accordance with our values is, of course, a different question: It is
something over which we have some but not complete control.
Epictetus, as we have seen, thinks we have complete control
over our opinions. If by opinions he has in mind our opinions
on what goals we should set for ourselves or our opinions on
the value of things, then I agree with him that our opinions
are “up to us.”
It will clearly make sense for us to spend time and energy
setting goals for ourselves and determining our values. Doing
this will take relatively little time and energy. Furthermore,
the reward for choosing our goals and values properly can be
enormous. Indeed, Marcus thinks the key to having a good
life is to value things that are genuinely valuable and be indifferent to things that lack value. He adds that because we have
it in our power to assign value to things, we have it in our
power to live a good life. More generally, Marcus thinks that by
forming opinions properly—by assigning things their correct
value—we can avoid much suffering, grief, and anxiety and can
thereby achieve the tranquility the Stoics seek.9
Besides having complete control over our goals and values,
Marcus points out that we have complete control over our
character. We are, he says, the only ones who can stop
ourselves from attaining goodness and integrity. We have it
entirely within our power, for example, to prevent viciousness and cupidity from ﬁnding a home in our soul. If we are
slow-witted, it might not be in our power to become a scholar,

The Dichotomy of Control 93

but there is nothing to stop us from cultivating a number of
other qualities, including sincerity, dignity, industriousness,
and sobriety; nor is there anything to stop us from taking
steps to curb our arrogance, to rise above pleasures and pains,
to stop lusting after popularity, and to control our temper.
Furthermore, we have it in our power to stop grumbling,
to be considerate and frank, to be temperate in manner and
speech, and to carry ourselves “with authority.” These qualities, Marcus observes, can be ours at this very moment—if we
choose for them to be.10
Now let us turn our attention back to the second branch of
the trichotomy of control, to things over which we have no
control at all, such as whether the sun will rise tomorrow. It is
obviously foolish for us to spend time and energy concerning
ourselves with such things. Because we have no control at all
over the things in question, any time and energy we spend will
have no effect on the outcome of events and will therefore be
wasted time and energy, and, as Marcus observes, “Nothing is
worth doing pointlessly.”11
This brings us to the third branch of the trichotomy of
control: those things over which we have some but not complete
control. Consider, for example, winning a tennis match. As we
have seen, although we can’t be certain of winning a match,
we can hope, through our actions, to affect the outcome; we
therefore have some but not complete control. Given that
this is so, will a practicing Stoic wish to concern himself with
tennis? In particular, should he spend time and energy trying
to win matches?

94 Stoic Psychological Techniques

We might think he shouldn’t. Because the Stoic doesn’t have
complete control over the outcome of a tennis match, there is
always a chance that he will lose, but if he loses, he will likely
be upset, and his tranquility will be disturbed. A safer course
of action for a Stoic, then, would seem to be to refrain from
playing tennis. By similar reasoning, if he values his tranquility,
it seems as though he should not want his wife to love him;
there is a chance that, regardless of what he does, she won’t,
and he will be heartbroken. Likewise, he shouldn’t want his
boss to give him a raise; there is again a chance that, regardless of what he does, she won’t, and he will be disappointed.
Indeed, taking this line of thought a step further, the Stoic
shouldn’t even have asked his wife to marry him or his boss to
hire him, since they might have turned him down.
One might conclude, in other words, that Stoics will
refuse to concern themselves with things over which they
have some but not complete control. But because most of
the things that come up in daily living are things over which
we have some but not complete control, it would follow that
Stoics will not concern themselves with many aspects of
everyday life. They will instead be passive, withdrawn underachievers. Indeed, they will resemble depressed individuals
who might not even be able to rouse themselves from bed
in the morning.
Before we succumb to this line of argument, though, we
should recall that the Stoics weren’t passive and withdrawn.
To the contrary, they were fully engaged in daily life. From
this, one of two conclusions follows: Either the Stoics were
hypocrites who did not act in accordance with their principles,

The Dichotomy of Control 95

or we have, in the above argument, somehow misinterpreted
Stoic principles. I shall now argue for this second alternative.
Remember that among the things over which we have
complete control are the goals we set for ourselves. I think
that when a Stoic concerns himself with things over which he
has some but not complete control, such as winning a tennis
match, he will be very careful about the goals he sets for
himself. In particular, he will be careful to set internal rather
than external goals. Thus, his goal in playing tennis will not
be to win a match (something external, over which he has
only partial control) but to play to the best of his ability in
the match (something internal, over which he has complete
control). By choosing this goal, he will spare himself frustration or disappointment should he lose the match: Since it was
not his goal to win the match, he will not have failed to attain
his goal, as long as he played his best. His tranquility will not
be disrupted.
It is worth noting at this point that playing to the best of
your ability in a tennis match and winning that match are
causally connected. In particular, what better way is there
to win a tennis match than by playing to the best of your
ability? The Stoics realized that our internal goals will affect
our external performance, but they also realized that the
goals we consciously set for ourselves can have a dramatic
impact on our subsequent emotional state. In particular, if
we consciously set winning a tennis match as our goal, we
arguably don’t increase our chances of winning that match.
In fact, we might even hurt our chances: If it starts looking,

96

Stoic Psychological Techniques

early on, as though we are going to lose the match, we might
become ﬂustered, and this might negatively affect our playing
in the remainder of the game, thereby hurting our chances
of winning. Furthermore, by having winning the match as
our goal, we dramatically increase our chances of being upset
by the outcome of the match. If, on the other hand, we set
playing our best in a match as our goal, we arguably don’t
lessen our chances of winning the match, but we do lessen
our chances of being upset by the outcome of the match.
Thus, internalizing our goals with respect to tennis would
appear to be a no-brainer: To set as our goal playing to the
best of our ability has an upside—reduced emotional anguish
in the future—with little or no downside.
When it comes to other, more signiﬁcant aspects of his life,
a Stoic will likewise be careful in the goals he sets for himself.
Stoics would recommend, for example, that I concern myself
with whether my wife loves me, even though this is something
over which I have some but not complete control. But when I do
concern myself with this, my goal should not be the external
goal of making her love me; no matter how hard I try, I could fail
to achieve this goal and would as a result be quite upset. Instead,
my goal should be an internal goal: to behave, to the best of
my ability, in a lovable manner. Similarly, my goal with respect
to my boss should be to do my job to the best of my ability.
These are goals I can achieve no matter how my wife and my
boss subsequently react to my efforts. By internalizing his goals
in daily life, the Stoic is able to preserve his tranquility while
dealing with things over which he has only partial control.

The trichotomy of control.

It is especially important, I think, for us to internalize our
goals if we are in a profession in which “external failure”
is commonplace. Think, for example, about an aspiring
novelist. To succeed in her chosen profession, she must ﬁght
and win two battles: She must master her craft, and she must
deal with rejection of her work—most novelists hear “No”
many, many times before hearing “Yes.” Of these two battles,
the second is, for most people, the hardest. How many
would-be novelists, one wonders, don’t submit the manuscript they have written because they dread hearing the word
“No”? And how many would-be novelists, on hearing “No”
once, are crushed by the experience and never resubmit the
manuscript?

98

Stoic Psychological Techniques

How can the aspiring novelist reduce the psychological
cost of rejection and thereby increase her chances of success?
By internalizing her goals with respect to novel writing. She
should have as her goal not something external over which
she has little control, such as getting her novel published, but
something internal over which she has considerable control,
such as how hard she works on the manuscript or how many
times she submits it in a given period of time. I don’t claim
that by internalizing her goals in this manner she can eliminate altogether the sting when she gets a rejection letter (or, as
often happens, when she fails to get any response at all to the
work she has submitted). It can, however, substantially reduce
this sting. Instead of moping for a year before resubmitting her
manuscript, she might get her moping period down to a week
or even a day, and this change will dramatically increase her
chance of getting the manuscript published.
Readers might complain that the process of internalizing our
goals is really little more than a mind game. The would-be novelist’s real goal is obviously to get her novel published—something
she knows full well—and in advising her to internalize her goals
with respect to the novel, I am doing little more than advising
her to pretend as if getting published weren’t her goal.
In response to this complaint, I would point out, to begin
with, that it might be possible for someone, by spending
enough time practicing goal internalization, to develop the
ability not to look beyond her internalized goals—in which
case they would become her “real” goals. Furthermore, even
if the internalization process is a mind game, it is a useful mind

The Dichotomy of Control 99

game. Fear of failure is a psychological trait, so it is hardly
surprising that by altering our psychological attitude toward
“failure” (by carefully choosing our goals), we can affect the
degree to which we fear it.
The Stoics, as I have explained, were very much interested
in human psychology and were not at all averse to using
psychological “tricks” to overcome certain aspects of human
psychology, such as the presence in us of negative emotions.
Indeed, the negative visualization technique described in the
previous chapter is really little more than a psychological trick:
By thinking about how things could be worse, we forestall
or reverse the hedonic adaptation process. It is nevertheless a
singularly effective trick, if our goal is to appreciate what we
have rather than taking it for granted, and if our goal is to experience joy rather than becoming jaded with respect to the life
we happen to be living and the world we happen to inhabit.
Having said all this about the internalization of goals, let
me pause here to offer a confession. In my studies of Epictetus
and the other Stoics, I found little evidence that they advocate
internalizing goals in the manner I have described, which raises
questions about whether the Stoics in fact made use of the
internalization technique. Nevertheless, I have attributed the
technique to them, inasmuch as internalizing one’s goals is the
obvious thing to do if one wishes, as the Stoics did, to concern
oneself only with those things over which one has control and
if one wishes to retain one’s tranquility while undertaking
endeavors that might fail (in the external sense of the word).
In talking about the internalization of goals, then, I might be

100 Stoic Psychological Techniques

guilty of tampering with or improving on Stoicism. As I shall
explain in chapter 20, I have no qualms about doing this.
Now that we understand the technique of internalizing our
goals, we are in a position to explain what would otherwise
seem like paradoxical behavior on the part of Stoics. Although
they value tranquility, they feel duty-bound to be active participants in the society in which they live. But such participation
clearly puts their tranquility in jeopardy. One suspects, for
example, that Cato would have enjoyed a far more tranquil
life if he did not feel compelled to ﬁght the rise to power of
Julius Caesar—if he instead had spent his days, say, in a library,
reading the Stoics.
I would like to suggest, though, that Cato and the other
Stoics found a way to retain their tranquility despite their
involvement with the world around them: They internalized
their goals. Their goal was not to change the world, but to
do their best to bring about certain changes. Even if their
efforts proved to be ineffectual, they could nevertheless rest
easy knowing that they had accomplished their goal: They had
done what they could do.
A practicing Stoic will keep the trichotomy of control ﬁrmly
in mind as he goes about his daily affairs. He will perform a
kind of triage in which he sorts the elements of his life into
three categories: those over which he has complete control,
those over which he has no control at all, and those over
which he has some but not complete control. The things in
the second category—those over which he has no control at
all—he will set aside as not worth worrying about. In doing

The Dichotomy of Control 101

this, he will spare himself a great deal of needless anxiety.
He will instead concern himself with things over which he
has complete control and things over which he has some but
not complete control. And when he concerns himself with
things in this last category, he will be careful to set internal
rather than external goals for himself and will thereby avoid a
considerable amount of frustration and disappointment.

SIX

Fatalism
Letting Go of the Past . . . and the Present

One way to preserve our tranquility, the Stoics thought, is
to take a fatalistic attitude toward the things that happen to
us. According to Seneca, we should offer ourselves to fate,
inasmuch as “it is a great consolation that it is together with
the universe we are swept along.”1 According to Epictetus, we
should keep ﬁrmly in mind that we are merely actors in a play
written by someone else—more precisely, the Fates. We cannot
choose our role in this play, but regardless of the role we are
assigned, we must play it to the best of our ability. If we are
assigned by the Fates to play the role of beggar, we should play
the role well; likewise if we are assigned to play the role of
king. If we want our life to go well, Epictetus says, we should,
rather than wanting events to conform to our desires, make
our desires conform to events; we should, in other words, want
events “to happen as they do happen.”2
Marcus also advocates taking a fatalistic attitude toward
life. To do otherwise is to rebel against nature, and such rebellions are counterproductive, if what we seek is a good life. In
particular, if we reject the decrees of fate, Marcus says, we are
likely to experience tranquility-disrupting grief, anger, or fear.

Fatalism 103

To avoid this, we must learn to adapt ourselves to the environment into which fate has placed us and do our best to love
the people with whom fate has surrounded us. We must learn
to welcome whatever falls to our lot and persuade ourselves
that whatever happens to us is for the best. Indeed, according
to Marcus, a good man will welcome “every experience the
looms of fate may weave for him.”3
Like most ancient Romans, the Stoics took it for granted
that they had a fate. More precisely, they believed in the existence of three goddesses known as the Fates. Each of these
goddesses had a job: Clotho wove life, Lachesis measured it,
and Atropos cut it. Try as they might, people could not escape
the destiny chosen for them by the Fates.4
For ancient Romans, then, life was like a horse race that is
ﬁxed: The Fates already knew who would win and who would
lose life’s contests. A jockey would probably refuse to take part
in a race he knew to be ﬁxed; why bother racing when somebody somewhere already knows who will win? One might
likewise expect the ancient Romans to refuse to participate in
life’s contests; why bother, when the future has already been
determined? What is interesting is that despite their determinism, despite their belief that whatever happened had to
happen, the ancients were not fatalistic about the future. The
Stoics, for example, did not sit around apathetically, resigned
to whatever the future held in store; to the contrary, they spent
their days working to affect the outcome of future events.
Likewise, the soldiers of ancient Rome marched bravely off to
war and fought valiantly in battles, even though they believed
the outcomes of these battles were fated.

104 Stoic Psychological Techniques

This leaves us, of course, with a puzzle: Although the Stoics
advocate fatalism, they seem not to have practiced it. What
are we to make, then, of their advice that we take a fatalistic
attitude toward the things that happen to us?
To solve this puzzle, we need to distinguish between fatalism
with respect to the future and fatalism with respect to the past.
When a person is fatalistic with respect to the future, she will
keep ﬁrmly in mind, when deciding what to do, that her actions
can have no effect on future events. Such a person is unlikely to
spend time and energy thinking about the future or trying to
alter it. When a person is fatalistic with respect to the past, she
adopts this same attitude toward past events. She will keep ﬁrmly
in mind, when deciding what to do, that her actions can have no
effect on the past. Such a person is unlikely to spend time and
energy thinking about how the past might be different.
When the Stoics advocate fatalism, they are, I think, advocating a restricted form of the doctrine. More precisely, they
are advising us to be fatalistic with respect to the past, to
keep ﬁrmly in mind that the past cannot be changed. Thus,
the Stoics would not counsel a mother with a sick child to be
fatalistic with respect to the future; she should try to nurse
the child back to health (even though the Fates have already
decided whether the child lives or dies). But if the child dies,
they will counsel this woman to be fatalistic with respect to the
past. It is only natural, even for a Stoic, to experience grief after
the death of a child. But to dwell on that death is a waste of
time and emotions, inasmuch as the past cannot be changed.
Dwelling on the child’s death will therefore cause the woman
needless grief.

Fatalism 105

In saying that we shouldn’t dwell on the past, the Stoics
are not suggesting that we should never think about it. We
sometimes should think about the past to learn lessons that
can help us in our efforts to shape the future. The abovementioned mother, for example, should think about the
cause of her child’s death so that she may better protect
her other children. Thus, if the child died as the result of
eating poisonous berries, she should take steps to keep her
other children away from those berries and to teach them
that they are poisonous. But having done so, she should let
go of the past. In particular, she should not spend her days
with a head full of “if only” thoughts: “If only I had known
she was eating the berries! If only I had taken her to a doctor
sooner!”
Fatalism with respect to the past will doubtless be far more
palatable to modern individuals than fatalism with respect to
the future. Most of us reject the notion that we are fated to
live a certain life; we think, to the contrary, that the future is
affected by our efforts. At the same time, we readily accept
that the past cannot be changed, so when we hear the Stoics
counseling us to be fatalistic with respect to the past, we will
be unlikely to challenge the advice.
Besides recommending that we be fatalistic with respect to
the past, the Stoics, I think, advocate fatalism with respect
to the present. It is clear, after all, that we cannot, through
our actions, affect the present, if by the present we mean
this very moment. It may be possible for me to act in a
way that affects what happens in a decade, a day, a minute,

106 Stoic Psychological Techniques

or even a half-second from now; it is impossible, however, for
me to act in a way that alters what is happening right now,
since as soon as I act to affect what is happening right now, that
moment in time will have slipped into the past and therefore
cannot be affected.
In their advocacy of fatalism, then, the Stoics were advising
us to be fatalistic, not with respect to the future but with
respect to the past and present. In support of this interpretation of Stoic fatalism, it is useful to reconsider some of the
Stoic advice quoted above. When Epictetus advises us to want
events “to happen as they do happen,” he is giving us advice
regarding events that do happen—that either have happened or
are happening—not advice regarding events that will happen.
He is, in other words, advising us to behave fatalistically with
respect to the past and present. Likewise, just as you cannot
welcome a visitor until he arrives, Marcus’s good man cannot
welcome the experiences the looms of fate weave for him until
those experiences have arrived.
How can fatalism with respect to the present cause our life
to go well? The Stoics, as I have said, argued that the best way
to gain satisfaction is not by working to satisfy whatever desires
we ﬁnd within us but by learning to be satisﬁed with our life
as it is—by learning to be happy with whatever we’ve got. We
can spend our days wishing our circumstances were different,
but if we allow ourselves to do this, we will spend our days in
a state of dissatisfaction. Alternatively, if we can learn to want
whatever it is we already have, we won’t have to work to fulﬁll
our desires in order to gain satisfaction; they will already have
been fulﬁlled.

Fatalism 107

One of the things we’ve got, though, is this very moment,
and we have an important choice with respect to it: We can
either spend this moment wishing it could be different, or we
can embrace this moment. If we habitually do the former,
we will spend much of our life in a state of dissatisfaction;
if we habitually do the latter, we will enjoy our life. This,
I think, is why the Stoics recommend that we be fatalistic with
respect to the present. It is why Marcus reminds us that all we
own is the present moment and why he advises us to live in
“this ﬂeeting instant.”5 (This last advice, of course, echoes the
Buddhist advice that we should try to live in the moment—
another interesting parallel between Stoicism and Buddhism.)
Notice that the advice that we be fatalistic with respect to
the past and the present is consistent with the advice, offered
in the preceding chapter, that we not concern ourselves with
things over which we have no control. We have no control over
the past; nor do we have any control over the present, if by the
present we mean this very moment. Therefore, we are wasting
our time if we worry about past or present events.
Notice, too, that the advice that we be fatalistic with respect
to the past and present is connected, in a curious way, to the
advice that we practice negative visualization. In engaging in
negative visualization, we think of the ways our situation could
be worse, and our goal in doing so is to make us value whatever
we have. The fatalism advocated by the Stoics is in a sense the
reverse, or one might say the mirror image, of negative visualization: Instead of thinking about how our situation could
be worse, we refuse to think about how it could be better. In
behaving fatalistically with respect to the past and present, we

108 Stoic Psychological Techniques

refuse to compare our situation with alternative, preferable
situations in which we might have found or might now ﬁnd
ourselves. By doing this, the Stoics think, we will make our
current situation, whatever it may be, more tolerable.
My discussion of fatalism in this chapter and of negative
visualization in chapter 4 might make readers worry that the
practice of Stoicism will lead to complacency. Readers might
admit that the Stoics will be unusually satisﬁed with what they
have, whatever it may be—a blessing, to be sure. But won’t the
Stoics, as a result, be terribly unambitious?
In response to this concern, let me remind readers that
the Stoics we have been considering were notably ambitious.
Seneca, as we’ve seen, had an active life as a philosopher,
playwright, investor, and political advisor. Musonius Rufus
and Epictetus both ran successful schools of philosophy. And
Marcus, when he wasn’t philosophizing, was hard at work
ruling the Roman Empire. These individuals were, if anything,
overachievers. It is indeed curious: Although they would have
been satisﬁed with next to nothing, they nevertheless strove
for something.
Here is how Stoics would explain this seeming paradox.
Stoic philosophy, while teaching us to be satisﬁed with whatever we’ve got, also counsels us to seek certain things in life.
We should, for example, strive to become better people—to
become virtuous in the ancient sense of the word. We should
strive to practice Stoicism in our daily life. And we should, as
we shall see in chapter 9, strive to do our social duty: This is
why Seneca and Marcus felt compelled to participate in Roman

Fatalism 109

government and why Musonius and Epictetus felt compelled
to teach Stoicism. Furthermore, the Stoics see nothing wrong
with our taking steps to enjoy the circumstances in which we
ﬁnd ourselves; indeed, Seneca advises us to be “attentive to
all the advantages that adorn life.”6 We might, as a result, get
married and have children. We might also form and enjoy
friendships.
And what about worldly success? Will the Stoics seek fame
and fortune? They will not. The Stoics thought these things
had no real value and consequently thought it foolish to
pursue them, particularly if doing so disrupted our tranquility
or required us to act in an unvirtuous manner. This indifference to worldly success, I realize, will make them seem unmotivated to modern individuals who spend their days working
hard in an attempt to attain (a degree of ) fame and fortune.
But having said this, I should add that although the Stoics
didn’t seek worldly success, they often gained it anyway.
Indeed, the Stoics we have been considering would all have
counted as successful individuals in their time. Seneca and
Marcus were both wealthy and famous, and Musonius and
Epictetus, as heads of popular schools, would have enjoyed a
degree of renown and would presumably have been ﬁnancially
comfortable. They therefore found themselves in the curious
position of people who, though not seeking success, nevertheless gained it. In chapters 14 and 15 we will see how they dealt
with this predicament.

SEVEN

Self-Denial
On Dealing with the Dark Side of Pleasure

To engage in negative visualization is to contemplate the bad
things that can happen to us. Seneca recommends an extension
of this technique: Besides contemplating bad things happening,
we should sometimes live as if they had happened. In particular, instead of merely thinking about what it would be like
to lose our wealth, we should periodically “practice poverty”:
We should, that is, content ourselves with “the scantiest and
cheapest fare” and with “coarse and rough dress.”1
According to Seneca, Epicurus, a philosophical rival to the Stoics,
also practiced poverty.2 His goal in doing so, however, appears
to have been different from that of Seneca. Whereas Seneca
wanted to appreciate what he had, Epicurus wanted to examine
the things he thought he needed so he could determine which of
them he could in fact live without. He realized that in many cases,
we work hard to obtain something because we are convinced that
we would be miserable without it. The problem is that we can live
perfectly well without some of these things, but we won’t know
which they are if we don’t try living without them.
Musonius takes this technique one step further: He
thinks that besides living as if bad things had happened to us,

Self-Denial 111

we should sometimes cause them to happen. In particular, we
should periodically cause ourselves to experience discomfort
that we could easily have avoided. We might accomplish this by
underdressing for cold weather or going shoeless. Or we might
periodically allow ourselves to become thirsty or hungry, even
though water and food are at hand, and we might sleep on a
hard bed, even though a soft one is available.3
Many modern readers, on hearing this, will conclude that
Stoicism involves an element of masochism. Readers should
realize, though, that the Stoics didn’t go around ﬂogging
themselves. Indeed, the discomforts they inflicted upon
themselves were rather minor. Furthermore, they did not
inﬂict these discomforts to punish themselves; rather, they
did it to increase their enjoyment of life. And ﬁnally, it is
misleading to talk about the Stoics inﬂicting discomforts on
themselves. This creates the image of someone at odds with
himself, of someone forcing himself to do things he doesn’t
want to do. The Stoics, by way of contrast, welcomed a
degree of discomfort in their life. What the Stoics were advocating, then, is more appropriately described as a program
of voluntary discomfort than as a program of self-inﬂicted
discomfort.
Even this clariﬁcation of the Stoics’ attitude toward discomfort, though, will leave many modern readers puzzled: “Why
should we welcome even minor discomforts when it is possible
to enjoy perfect comfort?” they will ask. In response to this
question, Musonius would point to three beneﬁts to be derived
from acts of voluntary discomfort.

112 Stoic Psychological Techniques

To begin with, by undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort—
by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could
be warm and well fed—we harden ourselves against misfortunes
that might befall us in the future. If all we know is comfort, we
might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or
discomfort, as we someday almost surely will. In other words,
voluntary discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By
exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now,
we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a
debilitating illness in the future. Alternatively, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as an insurance premium which, if paid,
makes us eligible for beneﬁts: Should we later fall victim to a
misfortune, the discomfort we experience then will be substantially less than it otherwise would have been.
A second beneﬁt of undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort comes not in the future but immediately. A person who
periodically experiences minor discomforts will grow conﬁdent that he can withstand major discomforts as well, so the
prospect of experiencing such discomforts at some future
time will not, at present, be a source of anxiety for him. By
experiencing minor discomforts, he is, says Musonius, training
himself to be courageous.4 The person who, in contrast, is a
stranger to discomfort, who has never been cold or hungry,
might dread the possibility of someday being cold and hungry.
Even though he is now physically comfortable, he will likely
experience mental discomfort—namely, anxiety with respect
to what the future holds in store for him.
A third beneﬁt of undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort
is that it helps us appreciate what we already have. In particular,

Self-Denial 113

by purposely causing ourselves discomfort, we will better
appreciate whatever comfort we experience. It is, of course, nice
to be in a warm room when it is cold and blustery outside, but
if we really want to enjoy that warmth and sense of shelter, we
should go outside in the cold for a while and then come back in.
Likewise, we can (as Diogenes observed) greatly enhance our
appreciation of any meal by waiting until we are hungry before
we eat it and greatly enhance our appreciation of any beverage
by waiting until we are thirsty before we drink it.
It is instructive to contrast the advice that we periodically
undertake acts of voluntary discomfort with the advice that
might be offered by an unenlightened hedonist. Such a person
might suggest that the best way to maximize the comfort we
experience is to avoid discomfort at all costs. Musonius would
argue, to the contrary, that someone who tries to avoid all
discomfort is less likely to be comfortable than someone who
periodically embraces discomfort. The latter individual is likely
to have a much wider “comfort zone” than the former and will
therefore feel comfortable under circumstances that would
cause the former individual considerable distress. It would be
one thing if we could take steps to ensure that we will never
experience discomfort, but since we can’t, the strategy of
avoiding discomfort at all costs is counterproductive.
Besides periodically engaging in acts of voluntary discomfort, we should, say the Stoics, periodically forgo opportunities to experience pleasure. This is because pleasure has a dark
side. Indeed, pursuing pleasure, Seneca warns, is like pursuing
a wild beast: On being captured, it can turn on us and tear

114 Stoic Psychological Techniques

us to pieces. Or, changing the metaphor a bit, he tells us that
intense pleasures, when captured by us, become our captors,
meaning that the more pleasures a man captures, “the more
masters will he have to serve.”5
In mistrusting pleasure, the Stoics reveal their Cynic bloodlines. Thus, the Cynic philosopher Diogenes argues that the
most important battle any person has to ﬁght is the battle
against pleasure. The battle is particularly difficult to win
because pleasure “uses no open force but deceives and casts
a spell with baneful drugs, just as Homer says Circe drugged
the comrades of Odysseus.” Pleasure, he cautions, “hatches no
single plot but all kinds of plots, and aims to undo men through
sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch, with food too, and drink
and carnal lust, tempting the waking and the sleeping alike.”
And pleasure, “with a stroke of her wand . . . cooly drives her
victim into a sort of sty and pens him up, and now from that
time forth the man goes on living as a pig or a wolf.”6
There are some pleasures, the Stoics would argue, from
which we should always abstain. In particular, we should
abstain from those pleasures that can capture us in a single
encounter. This would include the pleasure to be derived from
certain drugs: Had crystal meth existed in the ancient world,
the Stoics would doubtless have counseled against its use.
Signiﬁcantly, though, the Stoics’ mistrust of pleasure doesn’t
end here. They also counsel us to make a point of sometimes
abstaining from other, relatively harmless pleasures. We might,
for example, make a point of passing up an opportunity to
drink wine—not because we fear becoming an alcoholic but
so we can learn self-control. For the Stoics—and, indeed,

Self-Denial 115

for anyone attempting to practice a philosophy of life—selfcontrol will be an important trait to acquire. After all, if we
lack self-control, we are likely to be distracted by the various
pleasures life has to offer, and in this distracted state we are
unlikely to attain the goals of our philosophy of life.
More generally, if we cannot resist pleasures, we will end up
playing, Marcus says, the role of slave, “twitching puppetwise
at every pull of self-interest,” and we will spend our life “ever
grumbling at today or lamenting over tomorrow.” To avoid
this fate, we must take care to prevent pains and pleasures from
overwhelming our rational capacity. We must learn, as Marcus
puts it, to “resist the murmurs of the ﬂesh.”7
As he goes about his daily business, then, the Stoic, besides
sometimes choosing to do things that would make him feel
bad (such as underdressing for the weather), will sometimes
choose not to do things that would make him feel good (such
as having a bowl of ice cream). This makes it sound as if Stoics
are antipleasure, but they aren’t. The Stoics see nothing wrong,
for example, with enjoying the pleasures to be derived from
friendship, family life, a meal, or even wealth, but they counsel
us to be circumspect in our enjoyment of these things. There
is, after all, a ﬁne line between enjoying a meal and lapsing into
gluttony. There is also a danger that we will cling to the things
we enjoy. Consequently, even as we enjoy pleasant things, we
should follow Epictetus’s advice and be on guard.8 Here is how,
according to Seneca, a Stoic sage would explain the difference
between the Stoic take on pleasure and that of the ordinary
person: Whereas the ordinary person embraces pleasure, the
sage enchains it; whereas the ordinary person thinks pleasure

116 Stoic Psychological Techniques

is the highest good, the sage doesn’t think it is even a good; and
whereas the ordinary person does everything for the sake of
pleasure, the sage does nothing.9
Of the Stoic techniques I have discussed in part 2 of this
book, the self-denial technique described in this chapter is
doubtless the hardest to practice. It won’t be fun, for example,
for a Stoic, because he is practicing poverty, to ride the bus
when he could be driving his car. It won’t be fun going out
into a winter storm with only a light jacket on just so he can
feel uncomfortably cold. And it certainly won’t be fun saying
no to the ice cream someone has offered him—and saying
it not because he is on a diet but so he can practice refusing
something he would enjoy. Indeed, a novice Stoic will have to
summon up all his willpower to do such things.
What Stoics discover, though, is that willpower is like muscle
power: The more they exercise their muscles, the stronger
they get, and the more they exercise their will, the stronger it
gets. Indeed, by practicing Stoic self-denial techniques over a
long period, Stoics can transform themselves into individuals
remarkable for their courage and self-control. They will be
able to do things that others dread doing, and they will be able
to refrain from doing things that others cannot resist doing.
They will, as a result, be thoroughly in control of themselves.
This self-control makes it far more likely that they will attain
the goals of their philosophy of life, and this in turn dramatically increases their chances of living a good life.
The Stoics will be the ﬁrst to admit that it takes effort to
exercise self-control. Having made this admission, though, they

Self-Denial 117

will point out that not exercising self-control also takes effort:
Just think, says Musonius, about all the time and energy people
expend in illicit love affairs that they would not have undertaken if they had self-control.10 Along similar lines, Seneca
observes that “chastity comes with time to spare, lechery has
never a moment.”11
The Stoics will then point out that exercising self-control
has certain beneﬁts that might not be obvious. In particular, as
strange as it may seem, consciously abstaining from pleasure
can itself be pleasant. Suppose, for example, that while on a
diet, you develop a craving for the ice cream you know to be
in your refrigerator. If you eat it, you will experience a certain
gastronomic pleasure, along with a certain regret for having
eaten it. If you refrain from eating the ice cream, though, you
will forgo this gastronomic pleasure but will experience pleasure of a different kind: As Epictetus observes, you will “be
pleased and will praise yourself ” for not eating it.12
This last pleasure, to be sure, is utterly unlike the pleasure that comes from eating ice cream, but it is nevertheless a genuine pleasure. Furthermore, if we paused to do a
careful cost-beneﬁt analysis before eating the ice cream—if we
weighed the costs and beneﬁts of eating it against the costs
and beneﬁts of not eating it—we might ﬁnd that the sensible
thing for us to do, if we wish to maximize our pleasure, is not
eat it. It is for just this reason that Epictetus counsels us, when
contemplating whether or not to take advantage of opportunities for pleasure, to engage in this sort of analysis.13
Along similar lines, suppose we follow Stoic advice to
simplify our diet. We might discover that such a diet, although

118 Stoic Psychological Techniques

lacking in various gastronomic pleasures, is the source of a
pleasure of an entirely different sort: “Water, barley-meal, and
crusts of barley-bread,” Seneca tells us, “are not a cheerful diet,
yet it is the highest kind of pleasure to be able to derive pleasure from this sort of food.”14
Leave it to the Stoics to realize that the act of forgoing pleasure can itself be pleasant. They were, as I’ve said, some of the
most insightful psychologists of their time.

EIGHT

Meditation
Watching Ourselves Practice Stoicism

To help us advance our practice of Stoicism, Seneca advises
that we periodically meditate on the events of daily living, how
we responded to these events, and how, in accordance with
Stoic principles, we should have responded to them. He attributes this technique to his teacher Sextius, who, at bedtime,
would ask himself, “What ailment of yours have you cured
today? What failing have you resisted? Where can you show
improvement?”1
Seneca describes for his readers one of his own bedtime
meditations and offers a list of the sorts of events he might
reﬂect on, along with the conclusions he might draw regarding
his response to these events:
• Seneca was too aggressive in admonishing someone; consequently, rather than correcting the person, the admonition
merely served to annoy him. His advice to himself: When
contemplating whether to criticize someone, he should consider not only whether the criticism is valid but also whether
the person can stand to be criticized. He adds that the worse
a man is, the less likely he is to accept constructive criticism.

120 Stoic Psychological Techniques

• At a party, people made jokes at Seneca’s expense, and rather
than shrugging them off, he took them to heart. His advice
to himself: “Keep away from low company.”
• At a banquet, Seneca was not seated in the place of honor
he thought he deserved. Consequently, he spent the banquet
angry at those who planned the seating and envious of those
who had better seats than he did. His assessment of his
behavior: “You lunatic, what difference does it make what
part of the couch you put your weight on?”
• He has heard that someone has spoken ill of his writing,
and he starts treating this critic as an enemy. But then he
starts thinking of all the people whose writing he himself
has criticized. Would he want all of them to think of
him as an enemy? Certainly not. Seneca’s conclusion: If
you are going to publish, you must be willing to tolerate
criticism.2
On reading these and the other irritants Seneca lists, one is
struck by how little human nature has changed in the past two
millennia.
The bedtime meditation Seneca is recommending is, of
course, utterly unlike the meditations of, say, a Zen Buddhist.
During his meditations, a Zen Buddhist might sit for hours
with his mind as empty as he can make it. A Stoic’s mind, in
contrast, will be quite active during a bedtime meditation. He
will think about the events of the day. Did something disrupt
his tranquility? Did he experience anger? Envy? Lust? Why did
the day’s events upset him? Is there something he could have
done to avoid getting upset?

Meditation 121

Epictetus takes Seneca’s bedtime-meditation advice one step
further: He suggests that as we go about our daily business, we
should simultaneously play the roles of participant and spectator.3 We should, in other words, create within ourselves a
Stoic observer who watches us and comments on our attempts
to practice Stoicism. Along similar lines, Marcus advises us to
examine each thing we do, determine our motives for doing it,
and consider the value of whatever it was we were trying to
accomplish. We should continually ask whether we are being
governed by our reason or by something else. And when we
determine that we are not being governed by our reason, we
should ask what it is that governs us. Is it the soul of a child?
A tyrant? A dumb ox? A wild beast? We should likewise be
careful observers of the actions of other people.4 We can, after
all, learn from their mistakes and their successes.
Besides reﬂecting on the day’s events, we can devote part of
our meditations to going through a kind of mental checklist.
Are we practicing the psychological techniques recommended
by the Stoics? Do we, for example, periodically engage in negative visualization? Do we take time to distinguish between
those things over which we have complete control, those things
over which we have no control at all, and those things over
which we have some but not complete control? Are we careful
to internalize our goals? Have we refrained from dwelling on
the past and instead focused our attention on the future? Have
we consciously practiced acts of self-denial? We can also use
our Stoic meditations as an opportunity to ask whether, in our
daily affairs, we are following the advice offered by the Stoics.
In part 3 of this book I describe this advice in detail.

122 Stoic Psychological Techniques

Something else we can do during our Stoic meditations is judge
our progress as Stoics. There are several indicators by which we
can measure this progress. For one thing, as Stoicism takes hold
of us, we will notice that our relations with other people have
changed. We will discover, says Epictetus, that our feelings aren’t
hurt when others tell us that we know nothing or that we are
“mindless fools” about things external to us. We will shrug off
their insults and slights. We will also shrug off any praise they
might direct our way. Indeed, Epictetus thinks the admiration of
other people is a negative barometer of our progress as Stoics:
“If people think you amount to something, distrust yourself.”5
Other signs of progress, says Epictetus, are the following:
We will stop blaming, censuring, and praising others; we will
stop boasting about ourselves and how much we know; and
we will blame ourselves, not external circumstances, when our
desires are thwarted. And because we have gained a degree
of mastery over our desires, we will ﬁnd that we have fewer
of them than we did before; we will ﬁnd, Epictetus says, that
our “impulses toward everything are diminished.” And quite
signiﬁcantly, if we have made progress as a Stoic, we will come
to regard ourselves not as a friend whose every desire must be
satisﬁed but “as an enemy lying in wait.”6
According to the Stoics, practicing Stoicism, besides
affecting the thoughts and desires we have when awake, will
affect our dream life. In particular, Zeno suggested that as we
make progress in our practice, we will stop having dreams in
which we take pleasure in disgraceful things.7
Another sign of progress in our practice of Stoicism is that
our philosophy will consist of actions rather than words. What

Meditation 123

matters most, says Epictetus, is not our ability to spout Stoic
principles but our ability to live in accordance with them.
Thus, at a banquet a Stoic novice might spend her time talking
about what a philosophically enlightened individual should
eat; a Stoic further along in her practice will simply eat that
way. Similarly, a Stoic novice might boast of her simple lifestyle
or of giving up wine in favor of water; a more advanced Stoic,
having adopted a simple lifestyle and having given up wine
in favor of water, will feel no need to comment on the fact.
Indeed, Epictetus thinks that in our practice of Stoicism, we
should be so inconspicuous that others don’t label us Stoics—
or even label us philosophers.8
The most important sign that we are making progress as
Stoics, though, is a change in our emotional life. It isn’t, as those
ignorant of the true nature of Stoicism commonly believe, that
we will stop experiencing emotion. We will instead ﬁnd ourselves
experiencing fewer negative emotions. We will also ﬁnd that we
are spending less time than we used to wishing things could be
different and more time enjoying things as they are. We will
ﬁnd, more generally, that we are experiencing a degree of tranquility that our life previously lacked. We might also discover,
perhaps to our amazement, that our practice of Stoicism has
made us susceptible to little outbursts of joy: We will, out of the
blue, feel delighted to be the person we are, living the life we are
living, in the universe we happen to inhabit.
For the ultimate proof that we have made progress as Stoics,
though, we will have to wait until we are faced with death.
It is only then, says Seneca, that we will know whether our
Stoicism has been genuine.9

124 Stoic Psychological Techniques

When we measure our progress as Stoics, we might ﬁnd that
it is slower than we had hoped or expected. The Stoics, though,
would be the first to admit that people can’t perfect their
Stoicism overnight. Indeed, even if we practice Stoicism all our
life, we are unlikely to perfect it; there will always be room for
improvement. Along these lines, Seneca tells us that his goal in
practicing Stoicism is not to become a sage; instead, he takes
his progress to be adequate as long as “every day I reduce the
number of my vices, and blame my mistakes.”10
The Stoics understood that they would encounter setbacks
in their practice of Stoicism. Thus, Epictetus, after telling his
students what they must do to practice Stoicism, went on to
tell them what they should do when they failed to follow his
advice.11 He expected, in other words, that novice Stoics would
routinely backslide. Along similar lines, Marcus recommends
that when our practice falls short of Stoic precepts, we should
not become despondent and certainly should not give up our
attempts to practice Stoicism; instead, we should return to the
attack and realize that if we can do the right thing, Stoically
speaking, most of the time, we are doing pretty well for
ourselves.12
Let me offer one last thought on making progress as a Stoic.
Marcus spent his adult life practicing Stoicism, and even though
he had a temperament well suited to it, he found that he would
hit low points, during which his Stoicism seemed incapable of
providing him the tranquility he sought. In the Meditations,
he offers advice on what to do at such junctures: Continue to
practice Stoicism, “even when success looks hopeless.”13

Duty
On Loving Mankind

As we have seen, the Stoics advise us to seek tranquility. They
realized, however, that this recommendation is not, by itself,
very helpful, so they went on to offer guidance on how best
to attain tranquility. They advise us, to begin with, to practice
the psychological techniques described in part 2 of this book.
They also offer advice on speciﬁc aspects of daily living. They
counsel us, for example, not to seek fame and fortune, since
doing so will likely disrupt our tranquility. They warn us to be
careful in choosing our associates; other people, after all, have
the power to shatter our tranquility—if we let them. They go
on to offer advice on how to deal with insults, anger, grief,
exile, old age, and even on the circumstances under which we
should have sex.
Let us now turn our attention to the Stoics’ advice on daily
living, beginning, in this chapter and the next, with their advice
on forming and maintaining social relations.
On examining our life, we will ﬁnd that other people are
the source of some of the greatest delights life has to offer,
including love and friendship. But we will also discover that

128 Stoic Advice

they are the cause of most of the negative emotions we experience. Strangers upset us when they cut us off in traffic.
Relatives trouble us with their problems. Our boss might
ruin our day by insulting us, and the incompetence of our
coworkers might cause us stress by increasing our workload.
Our friends might neglect to invite us to a party and thereby
cause us to feel slighted.
Even when other people don’t do anything to us, they can
disrupt our tranquility. We typically want others—friends, relatives, neighbors, coworkers, and even complete strangers—to
think well of us. We therefore spend time and energy trying
to wear the right clothes, drive the right car, live in the right
house in the right neighborhood, and so forth. These efforts,
however, are accompanied by a degree of anxiety: We fear that
we will make the wrong choices and that other people will
therefore think poorly of us.
Notice, too, that to afford socially desirable clothes, cars,
and houses, we have to work for a living and will probably
experience anxiety in connection with our job. And even if,
through our efforts, we succeed in gaining the admiration of
others, our tranquility is likely to be upset by the feelings of
envy that other, less successful people direct toward us. Seneca
said it well: “To know how many are jealous of you, count
your admirers.”1 In addition, we will have to deal with the
envy that we feel toward those who have enjoyed even greater
success than we have.
Because the Stoics valued tranquility and because they
appreciated the power other people have to disrupt our tranquility, we might expect them to have lived as hermits and to

Duty 129

advise us to do the same, but the Stoics did no such thing. They
thought that man is by nature a social animal and therefore
that we have a duty to form and maintain relationships with
other people, despite the trouble they might cause us.
In the Meditations, Marcus explains the nature of this social
duty. The gods, he says, created us for a reason—created us, as
he puts it, “for some duty.” In the same way that the function
of a ﬁg tree is to do a ﬁg tree’s work, the function of a dog is
to do a dog’s work, and the function of a bee is to do a bee’s
work, the function of a man is to do man’s work—to perform,
that is, the function for which the gods created us.2
What, then, is the function of man? Our primary function,
the Stoics thought, is to be rational. To discover our secondary
functions, we need only apply our reasoning ability. What we
will discover is that we were designed to live among other
people and interact with them in a manner that is mutually
advantageous; we will discover, says Musonius, that “human
nature is very much like that of bees. A bee is not able to live
alone: it perishes when isolated.”3 We will likewise discover
that, as Marcus puts it, “fellowship is the purpose behind our
creation.” Thus, a person who performs well the function of
man will be both rational and social.4
To fulfill my social duty—to do my duty to my kind—
I must feel a concern for all mankind. I must remember that
we humans were created for one another, that we were born,
says Marcus, to work together the way our hands or eyelids do.
Therefore, in all I do, I must have as my goal “the service and
harmony of all.” More precisely, “I am bound to do good to
my fellow-creatures and bear with them.”5

130 Stoic Advice

And when I do my social duty, says Marcus, I should do
so quietly and efﬁciently. Ideally, a Stoic will be oblivious to
the services he does for others, as oblivious as a grapevine
is when it yields a cluster of grapes to a vintner. He will
not pause to boast about the service he has performed but
will move on to perform his next service, the way the grape
vine moves on to bear more grapes. Thus, Marcus advises
us to perform with resoluteness the duties we humans were
created to perform. Nothing else, he says, should distract us.
Indeed, when we awaken in the morning, rather than lazily
lying in bed, we should tell ourselves that we must get up
to do the proper work of man, the work we were created to
perform.6
Marcus, it should be clear, rejects the notion of doing
our social duty in a selective manner. In particular, we cannot
simply avoid dealing with annoying people, even though doing
so would make our own life easier. Nor can we capitulate
to these annoying people to avoid discord. Instead, Marcus
declares, we should confront them and work for the common
welfare. Indeed, we should “show true love” to the people with
whom destiny has surrounded us.7
It is striking that Marcus would give such advice. Stoics
differ in which aspect of the practice of Stoicism they ﬁnd to
be most challenging. Some might ﬁnd it hardest, for example,
to stop dwelling on the past; others might ﬁnd it hardest to
overcome their lust for fame and fortune. The biggest obstacle
to Marcus’s practice of Stoicism, though, appears to have been
his rather intense dislike of humanity.

Duty 131

Indeed, throughout the Meditations, Marcus makes it abundantly clear how little he thinks of his fellow man. Earlier,
I quoted his advice that we begin each day by reminding
ourselves how annoying the people we encounter are going to
be—reminding ourselves, that is, of their interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill will, and selﬁshness. If this assessment of humanity sounds harsh, we don’t need to look hard to
ﬁnd even harsher assessments. Even the most agreeable of our
associates, Marcus says, is difﬁcult to deal with. He remarks that
when someone says he wants to be perfectly straightforward
with us, we should be on the lookout for a concealed dagger.8
Elsewhere, Marcus suggests that when we know our death
is at hand, we can ease our anguish on leaving this world by
taking a moment to reﬂect on all the annoying people we will
no longer have to deal with when we are gone. We should
also, he says, reﬂect on the fact that when we die, many of the
companions we worked so hard to serve will be delighted by
our passing. His disgust for his fellow humans is nicely summarized in the following passage: “Eating, sleeping, copulating,
excreting, and the like; what a crew they are!”9
What is signiﬁcant is that despite these feelings of disgust,
Marcus did not turn his back on his fellow humans. He could,
for example, have had a much easier life if he had delegated his
imperial responsibilities to subordinates or if he had simply let
things slide, but his sense of duty prevailed; indeed, he gained
a reputation for “the unwearied zeal with which he discharged
the duties of his great position.”10 And all the while, he worked
hard not merely to form and maintain relations with other
people but to love them.

132 Stoic Advice

Modern readers will naturally wonder how Marcus was
able to accomplish this feat, how he was able to overcome his
disgust for his fellow humans and work on their behalf. Part of
the reason we marvel at Marcus’s accomplishment is that we
have a different notion of duty than he did. What motivates
most of us to do our duty is the fear that we will be punished—
perhaps by God, our government, or our employer—if we
don’t. What motivated Marcus to do his duty, though, was not
fear of punishment but the prospect of a reward.
The reward in question is not the thanks of those we help;
Marcus says that he no more expects thanks for the services
he performs than a horse expects thanks for the races it runs.
Nor does he seek the admiration of other people or even their
sympathy.11 To the contrary, the reward for doing one’s social
duty, Marcus says, is something far better than thanks, admiration, or sympathy.
Marcus, as we have seen, thought the gods created us with
a certain function in mind. He also thought that when they
created us, they made sure that if we fulﬁlled this function, we
would experience tranquility and have all things to our liking.
Indeed, if we do the things we were made for, says Marcus,
we will enjoy “a man’s true delight.”12 But an important part
of our function, as we have seen, is to work with and for our
fellow men. Marcus therefore concludes that doing his social
duty will give him the best chance at having a good life. This,
for Marcus, is the reward for doing one’s duty: a good life.
For many readers, I realize, this line of reasoning will fall
ﬂat. They will insist that duty is the enemy of happiness and
consequently that the best way to have a good life is to escape

Duty 133

all forms of duty: Rather than spending our days doing things
we have to do, we should spend them doing things we want to
do. In chapter 20 I return to this question. For now, let me say
this: Throughout the millennia and across cultures, those who
have thought carefully about desire have drawn the conclusion
that spending our days working to get whatever it is we ﬁnd
ourselves wanting is unlikely to bring us either happiness or
tranquility.

Social Relations
On Dealing with Other People

The Stoics, it should by now be clear, are faced with a
dilemma. If they associate with other people, they run the risk
of having their tranquility disturbed by them; if they preserve
their tranquility by shunning other people, they will fail to do
their social duty to form and maintain relationships. The question for the Stoics, then, is this: How can they preserve their
tranquility while interacting with other people? The Stoics
thought long and hard about this question. In the process of
answering it, they developed a body of advice on how to deal
with other people.
To begin with, the Stoics recommend that we prepare for our
dealings with other people before we have to deal with them.
Thus, Epictetus advises us to form “a certain character and
pattern” for ourselves when we are alone. Then, when we associate with other people, we should remain true to who we are.1
The Stoics, as we have seen, think we cannot be selective in
doing our social duty: There will be times when we must associate with annoying, misguided, or malicious people in order
to work for common interests. We can, however, be selective
about whom we befriend. The Stoics therefore recommend

Social Relations 135

that we avoid befriending people whose values have been
corrupted, for fear that their values will contaminate ours. We
should instead seek, as friends, people who share our (proper
Stoic) values and in particular, people who are doing a better
job than we are of living in accordance with these values. And
while enjoying the companionship of these individuals, we
should work hard to learn what we can from them.
Vices, Seneca warns, are contagious: They spread, quickly
and unnoticed, from those who have them to those with whom
they come into contact.2 Epictetus echoes this warning: Spend
time with an unclean person, and we will become unclean
as well.3 In particular, if we associate with people who have
unwholesome desires, there is a very real danger that we will
soon discover similar desires in ourselves, and our tranquility
will thereby be disrupted. Thus, when it is possible to do so,
we should avoid associating with people whose values have
been corrupted, the way we would avoid, say, kissing someone
who obviously has the ﬂu.
Besides advising us to avoid people with vices, Seneca advises
us to avoid people who are simply whiny, “who are melancholy
and bewail everything, who ﬁnd pleasure in every opportunity
for complaint.” He justiﬁes this avoidance by observing that
a companion “who is always upset and bemoans everything
is a foe to tranquility.”4 (In his famous dictionary, by the way,
Samuel Johnson includes a wonderful term for these individuals: A seeksorrow, he explains, is “one who contrives to give
himself vexation.”)5
Besides being selective about the people we befriend, we
should be selective, say the Stoics, about which social functions

136 Stoic Advice

we attend (unless doing our social duty requires us to attend
them). Epictetus, for example, advises us to avoid banquets given
by nonphilosophers. He also advises us, when we do socialize,
to be circumspect in our conversation. People tend to talk about
certain things; back in Epictetus’s time, he says, they talked about
gladiators, horse races, athletes, eating and drinking—and, most
of all, about other people. When we ﬁnd ourselves in a group
that is conversing about such things, Epictetus advises us to
be silent or to have few words; alternatively, we might subtly
attempt to divert the talk to “something appropriate.”6
This advice, to be sure, is a bit dated; people no longer talk
about gladiators (although, signiﬁcantly, they still do talk about
horse races, athletes, eating and drinking—and, of course,
about other people). But modern individuals can nevertheless
extract the core of Epictetus’s social advice. It is permissible—
indeed, it is sometimes necessary—for us to socialize with
“nonphilosophers,” with individuals, that is, who do not share
our Stoic values. When we do so, however, we must take care:
There is a danger, after all, that their values will contaminate
ours and will thereby set us back in our practice of Stoicism.
What about those occasions on which, in order to do our
social duty, we must deal with annoying people? How can we
prevent them from disturbing our tranquility?
Marcus recommends that when we interact with an
annoying person, we keep in mind that there are doubtless
people who ﬁnd us to be annoying. More generally, when
we ﬁnd ourselves irritated by someone’s shortcomings, we
should pause to reﬂect on our own shortcomings. Doing this

Social Relations 137

will help us become more empathetic to this individual’s faults
and therefore become more tolerant of him. When dealing
with an annoying person, it also helps to keep in mind that
our annoyance at what he does will almost invariably be more
detrimental to us than whatever it is he is doing.7 In other
words, by letting ourselves become annoyed, we only make
things worse.
We can also, Marcus suggests, lessen the negative impact
other people have on our life by controlling our thoughts
about them. He counsels us, for example, not to waste time
speculating about what our neighbors are doing, saying,
thinking, or scheming. Nor should we allow our mind to be
ﬁlled with “sensual imaginings, jealousies, envies, suspicions,
or any other sentiments” about them that we would blush to
admit. A good Stoic, Marcus says, will not think about what
other people are thinking except when he must do so in order
to serve the public interest.8
Most important, Marcus thinks it will be easier for us to deal
with impudent people if we keep in mind that the world cannot
exist without such individuals. People, Marcus reminds us, do
not choose to have the faults they do. Consequently, there is
a sense in which the people who annoy us cannot help doing
so. It is therefore inevitable that some people will be annoying;
indeed, to expect otherwise, Marcus says, is like expecting a ﬁg
tree not to yield its juice. Thus, if we ﬁnd ourselves shocked or
surprised that a boor behaves boorishly, we have only ourselves
to blame: We should have known better.9
Marcus, as we have seen, advocates fatalism, as do the other
Stoics. What Marcus seems to be advocating in the passages just

138 Stoic Advice

cited is a special kind of fatalism, what might be called social
fatalism: In our dealings with others, we should operate on the
assumption that they are fated to behave in a certain way. It is
therefore pointless to wish they could be less annoying. But
having said this, I should add that elsewhere, Marcus suggests
not only that other people can be changed but that we should
work to change them.10 Perhaps what Marcus is saying is that
even though it is possible to change others, we can take some
of the agony out of dealing with them by telling ourselves that
they are fated to behave as they do.
Suppose that even though we follow the above advice,
someone succeeds in annoying us. In such cases, Marcus says,
we should remind ourselves that “this mortal life endures but a
moment,” meaning that we soon will be dead.11 Putting annoying
incidents into their cosmic context, he thinks, will make their
triviality apparent and will therefore alleviate our annoyance.
According to Marcus, the biggest risk to us in our dealings
with annoying people is that they will make us hate them, a
hatred that will be injurious to us. Therefore, we need to work
to make sure men do not succeed in destroying our charitable
feelings toward them. (Indeed, if a man is good, Marcus says, the
gods will never see him harbor a grudge toward someone.) Thus,
when men behave inhumanely, we should not feel toward them
as they feel toward others. He adds that if we detect anger and
hatred within us and wish to seek revenge, one of the best forms
of revenge on another person is to refuse to be like him.12
Some of our most important relationships are with members
of the opposite sex, and the Stoics had much to say regarding

Social Relations 139

such relationships. A wise man, Musonius says, will not have
sex outside of marriage and within marriage will have it only
for the purpose of begetting children; to have sex in other
circumstances suggests a lack of self-control.13 Epictetus
agrees that we should avoid having sex before marriage, but
adds that if we succeed in doing this, we shouldn’t boast
about our chastity and belittle those who aren’t likewise
chaste.14
Marcus has even more misg ivings about sex than
Musonius and Epictetus did. In the Meditations, he provides
us with a technique for discovering the true value of things:
If we analyze something into the elements that compose it,
we will see the thing for what it really is and thereby value
it appropriately. Fine wine, thus analyzed, turns out to be
nothing more than fermented grape juice, and the purple
robes that Romans valued so highly turn out to be nothing
more than the wool of a sheep stained with gore from a
shellﬁsh. When Marcus applies this analytical technique to
sex, he discovers that it is nothing more than “friction of the
members and an ejaculatory discharge.”15 We would therefore
be foolish to place a high value on sexual relations and more
foolish still to disrupt our life in order to experience such
relations.
As it so happens, Buddhists recommend the use of this same
analytic technique. When, for example, a man ﬁnds himself
lusting after a woman, Buddhists might advise him to think not
about her as a whole, but about the things that compose her,
including her lungs, excrement, phlegm, pus, and spittle. Doing
this, Buddhists claim, will help the man extinguish his lustful

140 Stoic Advice

feelings. If this doesn’t do the trick, Buddhists might advise him
to imagine her body in the various stages of decomposition.16
The Stoics’ advocacy of sexual reserve will sound prudish
to modern readers, but they had a point. We live in an age
of sexual indulgence, and for many people the consequences
of this indulgence have been catastrophic in terms of their
peace of mind. Think, for example, about the young woman
who, because she could not resist sexual temptation, is now
faced with the hardship that generally accompanies single
parenthood, or the young man who, because he could not
resist temptation, is now burdened with responsibilities
(or at least child-support payments) that prevent him from
pursuing the dreams he once had for himself. It is easy these
days to ﬁnd people who will agree that their life would have
gone better if they had shown more sexual reserve; it is hard
to ﬁnd people who think their life would have gone better if
they had shown less.
The Stoics, we should note, were not alone among the
ancients in pointing to the destructive power of sex. Epicurus
may have been the philosophical rival of the Stoics, but he
shared their misgivings about sex: “Sexual intercourse has never
done a man good, and he is lucky if it has not harmed him.”17
But having said all this, I should add that despite their misgivings about sex, the Stoics were big advocates of marriage. A
wise man, Musonius says, will marry, and having married, he
and his wife will work hard to keep each other happy. Indeed,
in a good marriage, two people will join in a loving union and
will try to outdo each other in the care they show for each
other.18 Such a marriage, one imagines, will be very happy.

Social Relations 141

And having married, a wise man will bring children into
the world. No religious procession, Musonius says, is as beautiful as a group of children guiding their parents through the
city, leading them by the hand and taking care of them.19 Few
people, Musonius would have us believe, are happier than the
person who has both a loving spouse and devoted children.

ELEVEN

Insults
On Putting Up with Put-Downs

Some will think it strange that the Roman Stoics would
spend time talking about insults and how best to deal with
them. “Is this the proper function of a philosopher?” they will
ask. It is, if we think, as the Stoics did, that the proper role of
philosophy is to develop a philosophy of life.
The Stoics, as we have seen, counsel us to pursue tranquility. They realized, however, that one thing that prevents
people from attaining and maintaining tranquility is the insults
of others. As part of the strategy-for-living component of their
philosophy of life, the Stoics therefore spent time developing
techniques people could use to prevent the insults of others
from upsetting them. In this chapter, I examine some of these
techniques.
In what follows, I use the word insult in a very broad sense,
to include not just verbal abuse, such as calling someone a
name, but also “insults by omission,” such as slighting or snubbing someone, and physical insults, such as slapping someone.
People tend to be exquisitely sensitive to insults. As Musonius
points out, under some circumstances a mere glance can be
construed as an insult.1 Furthermore, even when they are

Insults 143

nonphysical, insults can be quite painful. If someone in a position of authority, a boss or teacher, for example, upbraids you
in public, your feelings of anger and humiliation will likely be
intense. Not only that, but insults are capable of causing you
pain long after they have been delivered. A decade after the
upbraiding just described, you might, in an idle moment, recall
the incident, and despite the passage of time, you might ﬁnd
yourself again convulsed with anger.
To appreciate the power of insults to upset our tranquility,
we need only take a look at the things that upset us in daily
living. High on the list will be the insulting behavior of other
people, including, most prominently, our friends, relatives, and
coworkers. Sometimes these individuals openly and directly
insult us: “You are a fool.” More commonly, though, their
insults are subtle or indirect. They might make us the butt of
a joke: “Could you please put on a hat? The sunlight reﬂecting
off the top of your head is blinding me.” Or, after congratulating us for some success, they might feel compelled to remind
us, for the hundredth time, of some past failure. Or they might
offer us backhanded compliments: “That outﬁt hides your
bulges.” Or they might slight us by taking us for granted or by
failing to give us the respect we feel we deserve. Or they might
make a disparaging remark about us to someone else, who
subsequently reports the remark to us. Any of these things
can, if we let them, ruin our day.
It isn’t only in modern times that people have been sensitive to
insults. By way of illustration, consider the kinds of things that,
according to Seneca, would have counted as insults in ancient
Rome: “ ‘So-and-so did not give me an audience to-day, though

144 Stoic Advice

he gave it to others’; ‘he haughtily repulsed or openly laughed
at my conversation’; ‘he did not give me the seat of honour,
but placed me at the foot of the table.’ ”2 If any of these things
happened today, they would certainly be perceived as insults.
When insulted, people typically become angry. Because
anger is a negative emotion that can upset our tranquility, the
Stoics thought it worthwhile to develop strategies to prevent
insults from angering us—strategies for removing, as it were,
the sting of an insult. One of their sting-elimination strategies is to pause, when insulted, to consider whether what the
insulter said is true. If it is, there is little reason to be upset.
Suppose, for example, that someone mocks us for being bald
when we in fact are bald: “Why is it an insult,” Seneca asks, “to
be told what is self-evident?”3
Another sting-elimination strategy, suggested by Epictetus,
is to pause to consider how well-informed the insulter is. He
might be saying something bad about us not because he wants
to hurt our feelings but because he sincerely believes what he
is saying, or, at any rate, he might simply be reporting how
things seem to him.4 Rather than getting angry at this person
for his honesty, we should calmly set him straight.
One particularly powerful sting-elimination strategy is to
consider the source of an insult. If I respect the source, if
I value his opinions, then his critical remarks shouldn’t upset
me. Suppose, for example, that I am learning to play the banjo
and that the person who is criticizing my playing is the skilled
musician I have hired as my teacher. In this case, I am paying
the person to criticize me. It would be utterly foolish, under

Insults 145

these circumstances, for me to respond to his criticisms with
hurt feelings. To the contrary, if I am serious about learning
the banjo, I should thank him for criticizing me.
Suppose, however, that I don’t respect the source of an insult;
indeed, suppose that I take him to be a thoroughly contemptible individual. Under such circumstances, rather than feeling
hurt by his insults, I should feel relieved: If he disapproves of
what I am doing, then what I am doing is doubtless the right
thing to do. What should worry me is if this contemptible
person approved of what I am doing. If I say anything at all in
response to his insults, the most appropriate comment would
be, “I’m relieved that you feel that way about me.”
When we consider the sources of insults, says Seneca, we
will often ﬁnd that those who insult us can best be described as
overgrown children.5 In the same way that a mother would be
foolish to let the “insults” of her toddler upset her, we would
be foolish to let the insults of these childish adults upset us.
In other cases, we will ﬁnd that those insulting us have deeply
flawed characters. Such people, says Marcus, rather than
deserving our anger, deserve our pity.6
As we make progress in our practice of Stoicism, we will
become increasingly indifferent to other people’s opinions of
us. We will not go through our life with the goal of gaining
their approval or avoiding their disapproval, and because we
are indifferent to their opinions, we will feel no sting when
they insult us. Indeed, a Stoic sage, were one to exist, would
probably take the insults of his fellow humans to be like the
barking of a dog. When a dog barks, we might make a mental
note that the dog in question appears to dislike us, but we

146 Stoic Advice

would be utter fools to allow ourselves to become upset by
this fact, to go through the rest of the day thinking, “Oh, dear!
That dog doesn’t like me!”
One other important sting-elimination strategy, say the
Stoics, is to keep in mind, when insulted, that we ourselves
are the source of any sting that accompanies the insult.
“Remember,” says Epictetus, “that what is insulting is not the
person who abuses you or hits you, but the judgment about
them that they are insulting.” As a result, he says, “another
person will not do you harm unless you wish it; you will
be harmed at just that time at which you take yourself to
be harmed.”7 From this it follows that if we can convince
ourselves that a person has done us no harm by insulting us,
his insult will carry no sting.
This last advice is really just an application of the broader
Stoic belief that, as Epictetus puts it, “what upsets people is not
things themselves but their judgments about these things.”8
To better understand this claim, suppose someone deprives
me of my property. He has done me harm only if it is my
opinion that my property had real value. Suppose, by way of
illustration, that someone steals a concrete birdbath from my
back yard. If I treasured this birdbath, I will be quite upset by
the theft. (And my neighbors, seeing how upset I am, might
be puzzled: “Why is he getting all worked up over a stupid
birdbath?” they will ask.) If I am indifferent to the birdbath,
however, I will not be upset by its loss. To the contrary, I will
be philosophical—more precisely, I will be Stoical—about the
incident: “There is no point in getting all worked up over a

Insults 147

stupid birdbath,” I will tell myself. My tranquility will not be
disrupted. Suppose, ﬁnally, that I abhor the birdbath: I keep it
only because it was a gift from a relative who will be upset if
I don’t display it in my back yard. Under these circumstances, I
might be delighted by its disappearance.
Do the things that happen to me help or harm me? It
all depends, say the Stoics, on my values. They would go
on to remind me that my values are things over which I
have complete control. Therefore, if something external
harms me, it is my own fault: I should have adopted different
values.
Even if we succeed in removing the sting of an insult, we are
left with the question of how best to respond to it. Most people
think that the best response is a counterinsult, preferably one
that is clever. The Stoics, however, reject this advice. And how
are we to respond to an insult, if not with a counterinsult? One
wonderful way, say the Stoics, is with humor.
Thus, Seneca points approvingly to Cato’s use of humor to
deﬂect a particularly grievous insult. Cato was pleading a case
when an adversary named Lentulus spit in his face. Rather than
getting angry or returning the insult, Cato calmly wiped off the
spit and said, “I will swear to anyone, Lentulus, that people are
wrong to say that you cannot use your mouth!”9 Seneca also
approves of Socrates’ response to an even more abusive insult.
Someone once came up to Socrates and, without warning,
boxed his ears. Rather than getting angry, Socrates made a joke
about what a nuisance it is, when we go out, that we can never
be sure whether or not to wear a helmet.10

148 Stoic Advice

Of the kinds of humor we might use in response to an insult,
self-deprecating humor can be particularly effective. Along these
lines, Seneca describes a man, Vatinius, whose neck was covered
with wens and whose feet were diseased, who joked about his
own deformities so much that others had nothing to add.11
Epictetus also advocates the use of self-deprecating humor.
Suppose, for example, you find out that someone has been
saying bad things about you. Epictetus advises you to respond
not by behaving defensively but by questioning his competence
as an insulter; for example, you can comment that if the insulter
knew you well enough to criticize you competently, he wouldn’t
have pointed to the particular failings that he did but would
instead have mentioned other, much worse failings.12
By laughing off an insult, we are implying that we don’t take
the insulter and his insults seriously. To imply this, of course, is
to insult the insulter without directly doing so. It is therefore a
response that is likely to deeply frustrate the insulter. For this
reason, a humorous reply to an insult can be far more effective
than a counterinsult would be.
The problem with replying to insults with humor is that
doing so requires both wit and presence of mind. Many of us
lack these traits. When insulted, we stand there dumbfounded:
We know we have been insulted but don’t know what to do
next. If a clever response comes to us, it comes hours later,
when it is of little use to us. Nothing is more pathetic, after all,
than a person who, a day after being insulted, walks up to the
person who insulted him, reminds him of what the insult was,
and then gives his reply to it.

Insults 149

The Stoics realized this and as a result advocated a second
way to respond to insults: with no response at all. Instead of
reacting to an insult, says Musonius, we should “calmly and
quietly bear what has happened.” This is, he reminds us,
“appropriate behavior for a person who wants to be magnanimous.”13 The advantage of a nonresponse, of simply carrying
on as if the insulter hadn’t even spoken, is that it requires no
thought on our part. Indeed, even the most slow-witted person
on the planet can respond to insults in this manner.
Along these lines, Seneca approvingly points to the response
of Cato when someone who did not know who he was struck
him at the public baths. When the person subsequently realized who Cato was and apologized to him, Cato, rather than
getting angry at the man or punishing him, simply replied,
“I don’t remember being struck.”14 Cato, says Seneca, showed
a ﬁner spirit by not acknowledging the blow than he would
have by pardoning it.15
Refusing to respond to an insult is, paradoxically, one of
the most effective responses possible. For one thing, as Seneca
points out, our nonresponse can be quite disconcerting to the
insulter, who will wonder whether or not we understood his
insult. Furthermore, we are robbing him of the pleasure of
having upset us, and he is likely to be upset as a result.16
Notice, too, that by not responding to an insulter, we are
showing him and anyone who is watching that we simply
don’t have time for the childish behavior of this person. If a
humorous response to an insult shows that we don’t take the
insulter seriously, a nonresponse to an insult makes it look as
if we are indifferent to the existence of the insulter: Not only

150 Stoic Advice

don’t we take him seriously, but we don’t take him at all! No
one wants to be ignored, though, and the insulter is likely to
feel humiliated by our failure to respond to him—not with a
counterinsult, not even with humor!
The above discussion makes it sound as if the Stoics are
complete paciﬁsts with respect to insults, as if they will never
respond to an insult with a counterinsult or by punishing the
insulter. This is not the case, though. According to Seneca,
there are times when it is appropriate for us to respond vigorously to an insult.
The danger in responding to insults with humor or with
no response at all is that some insulters are sufﬁciently slowwitted that they won’t realize that by refusing to respond to
their insults with counterinsults, we are displaying disdain for
what they think of us. Rather than being humiliated by our
response, they might be encouraged by our jokes or silence,
and they might start bombarding us with an endless stream of
insults. This can be particularly awkward if the person doing
the insulting was, in the ancient world, one’s slave or if he is, in
the modern world, one’s employee, student, or child.
The Stoics realized this and offered advice on how to deal
with such persons. In the same way that a mother might
admonish or punish the child who pulled her hair, we will, in
some cases, want to admonish or punish the person who childishly insults us. Thus, if a student insults her teacher in front of
the class, the teacher would be unwise to ignore the insult. The
insulter and her peers might, after all, interpret the teacher’s
nonresponse as acquiescence and as a result unleash a barrage

Insults 151

of insults against him. This behavior would obviously disrupt
the classroom and make it difﬁcult for students to learn.
In such cases, though, the Stoic needs to keep in mind that
he is punishing the insulter not because she has wronged him
but to correct her improper behavior. It is, says Seneca, like
training an animal: If in the course of trying to train a horse,
we punish him, it should be because we want him to obey us in
the future, not because we are angry about his failure to obey
us in the past.17
We live in a time, to be sure, in which few people are willing
to respond to an insult with humor or with a nonresponse.
Indeed, those who advocate politically correct speech think
the proper way to deal with some insults is to punish the
insulter. What most concerns them are insults directed at the
“disadvantaged,” including members of minority groups and
people with physical, mental, social, or economic handicaps.
Disadvantaged individuals, they argue, are psychologically
vulnerable, and if we let people insult them, they will suffer
grievous psychological harm. Advocates of politically correct
speech therefore petition the authorities—government ofﬁcials, employers, and school administrators—to punish anyone
who insults a disadvantaged individual.
Epictetus would reject this manner of dealing with insults
as being woefully counterproductive. He would point out, to
begin with, that the political correctness movement has some
untoward side effects. One is that the process of protecting
disadvantaged individuals from insults will tend to make them
hypersensitive to insults: They will, as a result, feel the sting not

152 Stoic Advice

only of direct insults but of implied insults as well. Another is
that disadvantaged individuals will come to believe that they
are powerless to deal with insults on their own—that unless
the authorities intercede on their behalf, they are defenseless.
The best way to deal with insults directed at the disadvantaged, Epictetus would argue, is not to punish those who insult
them but to teach members of disadvantaged groups techniques of insult self-defense. They need, in particular, to learn
how to remove the sting from whatever insults are directed at
them, and until they do this, they will remain hypersensitive
to insults and will, as a result, experience considerable distress
when insulted.
It is worth noting that Epictetus would, by modern standards, count as doubly disadvantaged: He was both lame and a
slave. Despite these disadvantages, he found a way to rise above
insults. More important, he found a way to experience joy
despite the bad hand fate had dealt him. The modern “disadvantaged,” one suspects, could learn a lot from Epictetus.

Grief
On Vanquishing Tears with Reason

Most parents, on learning of the death of a child, will be
emotionally devastated. They will weep, perhaps for days on
end, and they will be unable to go about their daily routine for
a time. Long after the death, they might experience grief ﬂashbacks; their eyes might well up, for example, on seeing a picture
of their child. And how will a Stoic respond to the death of a
child? One might imagine that he will respond with no response
at all, that he will suppress whatever feelings he might be having
or, better still, that he will have trained himself not to grieve.
The belief that Stoics never grieve, although widely held, is
mistaken. Emotions such as grief, the Stoics understood, are to
some extent reﬂexive. In much the same way that we cannot
help being startled when we hear a loud, unexpected noise—
it is a physical reﬂex—we cannot help feeling grief-stricken
when we learn of the unexpected loss of a loved one—it is
an emotional reﬂex. Thus, in his consolation to Polybius, who
was grieving the death of his brother, Seneca writes, “Nature
requires from us some sorrow, while more than this is the result
of vanity. But never will I demand of you that you should not
grieve at all.”1

154 Stoic Advice

How much should a Stoic grieve? In proper grief, Seneca
tells Polybius, our reason “will maintain a mean which will
copy neither indifference nor madness, and will keep us in
the state that is the mark of an affectionate, and not an unbalanced, mind.” Consequently, he advises Polybius to “let your
tears ﬂow, but let them also cease, let deepest sighs be drawn
from your breast, but let them also ﬁnd an end.”2
Although it might not be possible to eliminate grief from
our life, it is possible, Seneca thinks, to take steps to minimize
the amount of grief we experience over the course of a lifetime.
And given that such steps exist, we ought to take them. We live,
after all, in a world in which there is potentially much for us
to grieve. Consequently, says Seneca, we ought to be parsimonious with our tears, since “nothing must be husbanded more
carefully than that of which there is such frequent need.”3 It
was with these thoughts in mind that Seneca and the other
Stoics developed strategies by which we can prevent ourselves
from experiencing excessive grief and overcome quickly whatever grief we might ﬁnd ourselves experiencing.
The Stoics’ primary grief-prevention strategy was to engage
in negative visualization. By contemplating the deaths of
those we love, we will remove some of the shock we experience if they die; we will in a sense have seen it coming.
Furthermore, if we contemplate the deaths of those we love,
we will likely take full advantage of our relationships with
them and therefore won’t, if they die, ﬁnd ourselves ﬁlled
with regrets about all the things we could and should have
done with and for them.

Grief 155

Besides being used to prevent grief, negative visualization
can be used to extinguish it. Consider, for example, the advice
Seneca gives to Marcia, a woman who, three years after the
death of her son, was as grief-stricken as on the day she buried
him. Rather than spending her days thinking bitterly about the
happiness she has been deprived of by the death of her son,
Marcia should, says Seneca, think about how much worse off
she would be today if she had never been able to enjoy his
company. In other words, rather than mourning the end of his
life, she should be thankful that he lived at all.4
This is what might be called retrospective negative visualization. In normal, prospective negative visualization, we imagine
losing something we currently possess; in retrospective negative
visualization, we imagine never having had something that we
have lost. By engaging in retrospective negative visualization,
Seneca thinks, we can replace our feelings of regret at having
lost something with feelings of thanks for once having had it.
In his consolation to Polybius, Seneca offers advice on how
to overcome whatever grief we happen to be experiencing.
Reason is our best weapon against grief, he maintains, because
“unless reason puts an end to our tears, fortune will not do
so.” More generally, Seneca thinks that although reason might
not be able to extinguish our grief, it has the power to remove
from it “whatever is excessive and superﬂuous.”5
Seneca then sets about using rational persuasion to cure
Polybius of his excessive grief. For example, he argues that
the brother whose death Polybius is grieving either would or
wouldn’t want Polybius to be tortured with tears. If he would

156 Stoic Advice

want Polybius to suffer, then he isn’t worthy of tears, so Polybius
should stop crying; if he wouldn’t want Polybius to suffer, then
it is incumbent on Polybius, if he loves and respects his brother,
to stop crying. In another argument, Seneca points out that
Polybius’s brother, because he is dead, is no longer capable of
grief and that this is a good thing; it is therefore madness for
Polybius to go on grieving.6
Another of Seneca’s consolations is addressed to Helvia,
Seneca’s mother. Whereas Polybius had been grieving the
death of a loved one, Helvia was grieving the exile of Seneca.
In his advice to Helvia, Seneca takes the argument he offered
Polybius—that the person whose death Polybius is grieving
wouldn’t want him to grieve—one step further: Because it
is Seneca’s circumstances that Helvia is grieving, he argues
that inasmuch as he, being a Stoic, doesn’t grieve his circumstances, Helvia shouldn’t either. (His consolation to Helvia,
he observes, is unique: Although he read every consolation he
could ﬁnd, in not one of them did the author console people
who were bemoaning the author himself.)7
In some cases, such appeals to reason will doubtless help
alleviate, if only for a time, the grief someone is experiencing.
In cases of extreme grief, though, such appeals are unlikely
to succeed for the simple reason that the grieving person’s
emotions are ruling his intellect. But even in these cases, our
attempts to reason with him might be useful, inasmuch as
such attempts can make him understand the extent to which
his intellect has capitulated to his emotions and thereby
induce him, perhaps, to take steps to restore his intellect to
its rightful role.

Grief 157

Epictetus also offers advice on grief management.
He advises us, in particular, to take care not to “catch” the
grief of others. Suppose, for example, we encounter a griefstricken woman. We should, says Epictetus, sympathize with
her and maybe even accompany her moaning with moaning of
our own. But in doing so, we should be careful not to “moan
inwardly.”8 In other words, we should display signs of grief
without allowing ourselves to experience grief.
Some will be offended by this advice. When others are
grieving, they will assert, we shouldn’t just pretend as if we
sympathize with them; we should actually feel their losses
and actually grieve ourselves. Epictetus might respond to this
criticism by pointing out that the advice that we respond to
the grief of friends by grieving ourselves is as foolish as the
advice that we help someone who has been poisoned by taking
poison ourselves or help someone who has the ﬂu by intentionally catching it from him. Grief is a negative emotion and
therefore one that we should, to the extent possible, avoid
experiencing. If a friend is grieving, our goal should be to help
her overcome her grief (or rather, if we properly internalize
our goals, it should be to do our best to help her overcome her
grief ). If we can accomplish this by moaning insincerely, then
let us do so. For us to “catch” her grief, after all, won’t help her
but will hurt us.
Some readers will at this point become skeptical about the
wisdom and efﬁcacy of Stoic techniques for dealing with negative emotions. We live in an age in which the consensus view,
held by health professionals and laypersons alike, is that our
emotional health requires us to be in touch with our emotions,

158 Stoic Advice

to share them with others, and to vent them without reservation. The Stoics, on the other hand, advocate that we sometimes feign emotions and that we sometimes take steps to
extinguish the genuine emotions we find within us. Some
might therefore conclude that it is dangerous to follow Stoic
advice regarding our emotions, and because such advice lies at
the heart of Stoicism, they might go on to reject Stoicism as a
philosophy of life.
Rest assured that in chapter 20 I will respond to this criticism of Stoicism. I will do so, to the amazement of some, by
questioning consensus views on what we should do to maintain our emotional health. It is doubtless true that some individuals—those experiencing intense grief, for example—can
beneﬁt from psychological counseling. I also think, though,
that many people can enjoy robust emotional health without
resorting to such counseling. In particular, I think the practice
of Stoicism can help us avoid many of the emotional crises
that afﬂict people. I also think that if we do ﬁnd ourselves in
the grip of a negative emotion, following Stoic advice will, in
many cases, allow us single-handedly to subdue that emotion.

Anger
On Overcoming Anti-Joy

Anger is another negative emotion that, if we let it, can
destroy our tranquility. Indeed, anger can be thought of as
anti-joy. The Stoics therefore devised strategies to minimize
the amount of anger we experience.
The best single source for Stoic advice on preventing and
dealing with anger is Seneca’s essay “On Anger.” Anger, says
Seneca, is “brief insanity,” and the damage done by anger
is enormous: “No plague has cost the human race more.”
Because of anger, he says, we see all around us people being
killed, poisoned, and sued; we see cities and nations ruined.
And besides destroying cities and nations, anger can destroy
us individually. We live in a world, after all, in which there is
much to be angry about, meaning that unless we can learn to
control our anger, we will be perpetually angry. Being angry,
Seneca concludes, is a waste of precious time.1
Some maintain that anger has its uses. They point out that
when we are angry, we are motivated. Seneca rejects this claim.
It is true, he says, that people sometimes beneﬁt from being
angry, but it hardly follows from this that we should welcome

160 Stoic Advice

anger into our life. Notice, after all, that people also sometimes
beneﬁt from being in a shipwreck, yet who in their right mind
would therefore take steps to increase their chances of being
shipwrecked? What worries Seneca about employing anger as
a motivational tool is that after we turn it on, we will be unable
to turn it off, and that whatever good it initially does us will
(on average) be more than offset by the harm it subsequently
does. “Reason,” he cautions, “will never enlist the aid of reckless unbridled impulses over which it has no authority.”2
Is Seneca saying, then, that a person who sees his father
killed and his mother raped should not feel angry? That he
should stand there and do nothing? Not at all. He should
punish the wrongdoer and protect his parents, but to the
extent possible he should remain calm as he does so. Indeed,
he will probably do a better job of punishing and protecting
if he can avoid getting angry. More generally, when someone
wrongs us, says Seneca, he should be corrected “by admonition and also by force, gently and also roughly.” Such corrections, however, should not be made in anger. We are punishing
people not as retribution for what they have done but for their
own good, to deter them from doing again whatever they did.
Punishment, in other words, should be “an expression not of
anger but of caution.”3
In our discussion of insults, we saw that Seneca makes an
exception to his rule to respond to insults with humor or with
no response at all: If we are dealing with someone who, despite
being an adult, behaves like a child, we might want to punish
him for insulting us. It is, after all, the only thing he will understand. Likewise, there are individuals who, when they wrong

Anger 161

us, are incapable of changing their behavior in response to our
measured, rational entreaties. When dealing with this sort of
shallow individual, it does not make sense to become actually
angry—doing so will likely spoil our day—but it might make
sense, Seneca thinks, to feign anger.4 By doing this, we can get
this person to mend his ways with minimal disruption of our
own tranquility. In other words, although Seneca rejects the
idea of allowing ourselves to become angry in order to motivate ourselves, he is open to the idea of pretending to be angry
in order to motivate others.
Seneca offers lots of speciﬁc advice on how to prevent anger.
We should, he says, ﬁght our tendency to believe the worst
about others and our tendency to jump to conclusions about
their motivations. We need to keep in mind that just because
things don’t turn out the way we want them to, it doesn’t
follow that someone has done us an injustice. In particular,
says Seneca, we need to remember that in some cases, the
person at whom we are angry in fact helped us; in such cases,
what angers us is that he didn’t help us even more.5
If we are overly sensitive, we will be quick to anger. More
generally, says Seneca, if we coddle ourselves, if we allow
ourselves to be corrupted by pleasure, nothing will seem bearable to us, and the reason things will seem unbearable is not
because they are hard but because we are soft. Seneca therefore
recommends that we take steps to ensure that we never get
too comfortable. (This, of course, is only one of the reasons
Stoics give for eschewing comfort; in chapter 7 we examined
some others.) If we harden ourselves in this manner, we are

162 Stoic Advice

much less likely to be disturbed, he says, by the shouting of
a servant or the slamming of a door, and therefore much less
likely to be angered by such things. We won’t be overly sensitive about what others say or do, and we will be less likely to
ﬁnd ourselves provoked by “vulgar trivialities,” such as being
served lukewarm water to drink or seeing a couch in a mess.6
To avoid becoming angry, says Seneca, we should also keep
in mind that the things that anger us generally don’t do us
any real harm; they are instead mere annoyances. By allowing
ourselves to get angry over little things, we take what might
have been a barely noticeable disruption of our day and
transform it into a tranquility-shattering state of agitation.
Furthermore, as Seneca observes, “our anger invariably lasts
longer than the damage done to us.”7 What fools we are,
therefore, when we allow our tranquility to be disrupted by
minor things.
The Stoics, as we have seen, recommend that we use humor
to deﬂect insults: Cato cracked a joke when someone spit in
his face, as did Socrates when someone boxed his ears. Seneca
suggests that besides being an effective response to an insult,
humor can be used to prevent ourselves from becoming angry:
“Laughter,” he says, “and a lot of it, is the right response to the
things which drive us to tears!”8 The idea is that by choosing
to think of the bad things that happen to us as being funny
rather than outrageous, an incident that might have angered us
can instead become a source of amusement. Indeed, one imagines that Cato and Socrates, by using humor in response to an
insult, not only deﬂected the insult but prevented themselves
from getting angry at the person who had insulted them.

Anger 163

Marcus also offers advice on anger avoidance. He recommends, as we have seen, that we contemplate the impermanence of the world around us. If we do this, he says, we will
realize that many of the things we think are important in fact
aren’t, at least not in the grand scheme of things. He reﬂects
on the times, almost a century earlier, of Emperor Vespasian.
People everywhere were doing the usual things: marrying,
raising children, farming, loving, envying, ﬁghting, and feasting.
But, he points out, “of all that life, not a trace survives today.”9
By implication, this will be the fate of our generation: What
seems vitally important to us will seem unimportant to our
grandchildren. Thus, when we feel ourselves getting angry
about something, we should pause to consider its cosmic
(in)signiﬁcance. Doing this might enable us to nip our anger in
the bud.
Suppose we find that despite our attempts to prevent anger, the
behavior of other people succeeds in angering us. It will help
us to overcome our anger, says Seneca, if we remind ourselves
that our behavior also angers other people: “We are bad men
living among bad men, and only one thing can calm us—we
must agree to go easy on one another.” He also offers angermanagement advice that has a parallel in Buddhism. When
angry, says Seneca, we should take steps to “turn all [anger’s]
indications into their opposites.” We should force ourselves to
relax our face, soften our voice, and slow our pace of walking.
If we do this, our internal state will soon come to resemble
our external state, and our anger, says Seneca, will have dissipated.10 Buddhists practice a similar thought-substitution

164 Stoic Advice

technique. When they are experiencing an unwholesome
thought, Buddhists force themselves to think the opposite, and
therefore wholesome, thought. If they are experiencing anger,
for example, they force themselves to think about love. The
claim is that because two opposite thoughts cannot exist in one
mind at one time, the wholesome thought will drive out the
unwholesome one.11
What if we are unable to control our anger? Indeed, what
if we ﬁnd ourselves lashing out at whoever angered us? We
should apologize. Doing this can almost instantly repair the
social damage our outburst might have caused. It can also
beneﬁt us personally: The act of apologizing, besides having
a calming effect on us, can prevent us from subsequently
obsessing over the thing that made us angry. Finally, apologizing for the outburst can help us become a better person:
By admitting our mistakes, we lessen the chance that we will
make them again in the future.
Everyone occasionally experiences anger: Like grief, anger is
an emotional reﬂex. There are also people, though, who seem
to be angry pretty much all of the time. These individuals are
not only easily provoked to anger, but even when provocation
is absent they remain angry. Indeed, during leisure hours, these
individuals might spend their time recalling, with a certain degree
of relish, past events that made them angry or things in general
that make them angry. At the same time that it is consuming
them, anger appears to be providing them with sustenance.
Such cases, the Stoics would tell us, are tragic. For one thing,
life is too short to spend it in a state of anger. Furthermore,

Anger 165

a person who is constantly angry will be a torment to those
around her. Why not instead, Seneca asks, “make yourself a
person to be loved by all while you live and missed when you
have made your departure?”12 More generally, why experience
anti-joy when you have it in your power to experience joy?
Why, indeed?

Personal Values
On Seeking Fame

People are unhappy, the Stoics argue, in large part because
they are confused about what is valuable. Because of their
confusion, they spend their days pursuing things that, rather
than making them happy, make them anxious and miserable.
One of the things people mistakenly pursue is fame. The
fame in question comes in varying degrees. Some want to
be known around the world. Some seek not world fame, but
regional or local fame. Those who don’t actively pursue even
local fame nevertheless seek popularity within their social
circle or recognition in their chosen profession. And almost
everyone seeks the admiration of friends and neighbors. They
are convinced that gaining fame (in some very broad sense of
the word) will make them happy. They fail to realize that fame,
whether it involves world renown or merely the admiration of
their neighbors, comes at a price. Indeed, the Stoics claim that
the price of fame is sufﬁciently high that it far outweighs any
beneﬁts fame can confer on us.
To better appreciate the price of fame, consider the following
example, offered by Epictetus. Suppose it is your goal to be

Personal Values: On Seeking Fame 167

a socially prominent individual, to be “famous” within your
social circle, and suppose someone within your circle is giving
a banquet. If this person fails to invite you, you will pay a price:
You will likely be upset by the snub. But even if he does invite
you, Epictetus points out, it will be because you paid a price
in the past: You went out of your way to pay attention to the
banquet giver and to shower him with praise. Epictetus adds
that you are both greedy and stupid if you expect a place at the
banquet table without having paid this price.1
You would have been much better off, Epictetus thinks, if
you had been indifferent to social status. For one thing, you
would not have had to spend time trying to curry favor with
this person. Furthermore, you would have deprived him of the
ability to upset you simply by failing to invite you to a banquet.
Stoics value their freedom, and they are therefore reluctant
to do anything that will give others power over them. But if we
seek social status, we give other people power over us: We have
to do things calculated to make them admire us, and we
have to refrain from doing things that will trigger their disfavor.
Epictetus therefore advises us not to seek social status, since if
we make it our goal to please others, we will no longer be free
to please ourselves. We will, he says, have enslaved ourselves.2
If we wish to retain our freedom, says Epictetus, we must
be careful, while dealing with other people, to be indifferent to
what they think of us. Furthermore, we should be consistent in
our indifference; we should, in other words, be as dismissive of
their approval as we are of their disapproval. Indeed, Epictetus
says that when others praise us, the proper response is to laugh
at them.3 (But not out loud! Although Epictetus and the other

168 Stoic Advice

Stoics think we should be indifferent to people’s opinions of
us, they would advise us to conceal our indifference. After all,
to tell someone else that you don’t care what he thinks is quite
possibly the worst insult you can inﬂict.)
Marcus agrees with Epictetus that it is foolish for us to
worry about what other people think of us and particularly
foolish for us to seek the approval of people whose values we
reject. Our goal should therefore be to become indifferent to
other people’s opinions of us. He adds that if we can succeed
in doing this, we will improve the quality of our life.4
Notice that the advice that we ignore what other people
think of us is consistent with the Stoic advice that we not
concern ourselves with things we can’t control. I don’t have it
in my power to stop others from sneering at me, so it is foolish
for me to spend time trying to stop them. I should instead, says
Marcus, spend this time on something I have complete control
over, namely, not doing anything that deserves a sneer.5
Marcus also offers some words of advice to those who
value what many would take to be the ultimate form of fame:
immortal fame. Such fame, Marcus says, is “an empty, hollow
thing.” After all, think about how foolish it is to want to be
remembered after we die. For one thing, since we are dead,
we will not be able to enjoy our fame. For another, we are
foolish to think that future generations will praise us, without
even having met us, when we ﬁnd it so difﬁcult to praise our
contemporaries, even though we meet them routinely. Instead
of thinking about future fame, Marcus says, we would do well
to concern ourselves with our present situation; we should, he
advises, “make the best of today.”6

Personal Values: On Seeking Fame 169

Suppose we admit that the Stoics were right: We should ignore
what other people think of us. For most people, this will be
difﬁcult advice to follow. Most of us, after all, are obsessed
with other people’s opinions of us: We work hard, ﬁrst to win
the admiration of other people and then to avoid losing it.
One way to overcome this obsession, the Stoics think, is to
realize that in order to win the admiration of other people, we
will have to adopt their values. More precisely, we will have to
live a life that is successful according to their notion of success.
(If we are living what they take to be an unsuccessful life, they
will have no reason to admire us.) Consequently, before we
try to win the admiration of these other people, we should
stop to ask whether their notion of success is compatible with
ours. More important, we should stop to ask whether these
people, by pursuing whatever it is they value, are gaining the
tranquility we seek. If they aren’t, we should be more than
willing to forgo their admiration.
Another way to overcome our obsession with winning the
admiration of other people is to go out of our way to do things
likely to trigger their disdain. Along these lines, Cato made a
point of ignoring the dictates of fashion: When everyone was
wearing light purple, he wore dark, and although ancient Romans
normally went out in public wearing shoes and a tunic, Cato
wore neither. According to Plutarch, Cato did this not because he
“sought vainglory”; to the contrary, he dressed differently in order
to accustom himself “to be ashamed only of what was really
shameful, and to ignore men’s low opinion of other things.”7 In
other words, Cato consciously did things to trigger the disdain of
other people simply so he could practice ignoring their disdain.

170 Stoic Advice

Many people are haunted by a fear that in some cases signiﬁcantly constrains their freedom, namely, the fear of failure. The
individuals in question might contemplate doing something that
will test their courage, determination, and ability, but then decide
against the attempt, with the key factor in their decision being
the fear of failure. From their point of view, it is better not even
to attempt something than to fail while trying to accomplish it.
There are, to be sure, failures that any sensible person will
want to avoid—those failures, for example, that result in death
or disﬁgurement. The failures that many people seek to avoid,
though, will not cost them their life or health. The cost of
failure is instead having to endure the open mockery, or maybe
the silent pity, of those who learn of their failure. It is better,
failure-averse people reason, not even to attempt an undertaking than to run the risk of public humiliation.
Realize that many other people, including, quite possibly,
your friends and relatives, want you to fail in your undertakings. They may not tell you this to your face, but this doesn’t
mean that they aren’t silently rooting against you. People do
this in part because your success makes them look bad and
therefore makes them uncomfortable: If you can succeed, why
can’t they? Consequently, if you attempt something daring they
might ridicule you, predict disaster, and try to talk you out of
pursuing your goal. If, despite their warnings, you make your
attempt and succeed, they might ﬁnally congratulate you—or
they might not.
Consider again the woman, mentioned in an earlier chapter,
whose goal is to write a novel. Suppose she tells her friends,
relatives, and coworkers about her literary aspirations. Some

Personal Values: On Seeking Fame 171

of those she conﬁdes in will be genuinely encouraging. Others
will respond to her announcement, though, with gleeful pessimism. They might predict that she will never ﬁnish the novel.
(And to annoy her, they might, with clocklike regularity, ask
how the novel is coming along.) If she ﬁnishes it, they might
predict that she will never ﬁnd a publisher for it. If she ﬁnds a
publisher, they might predict that the novel will not sell well.
And if it sells well, they might hold up her success as evidence
of the low standards of the book-buying public.
It is, of course, possible for this woman to win the approval
of these naysayers: She need only abandon her dream of
becoming a novelist. If she does this, the naysayers will recognize her as a kindred spirit and will welcome her with open
arms. They will invite her to sit with them on a comfortable
couch somewhere and join them in mocking those individuals
who pursue their dreams despite the possibility of failure. But
is this really the company she wants to keep? Does she really
want to abandon the pursuit of her dream in order to win
these individuals’ acceptance?
This woman would do well, say the Stoics, to work at
becoming indifferent to what others think of her. And the
above naysayers, it should be clear, belong at the very top of
the list of people whose views she should learn to ignore.
Ironically, by refusing to seek the admiration of other people,
Stoics might succeed in gaining their (perhaps grudging)
admiration. Many people, for example, will construe the Stoics’
indifference to public opinion as a sign of self-confidence:
Only someone who really knows who she is—someone

172 Stoic Advice

who, as they say, feels good about herself—would display this
kind of indifference. These people might wish that they, too,
could ignore what other people thought of them.
In some cases, people’s admiration might be sufﬁcient for
them to ask the Stoic how she does it. When she reveals her
secret—when she confesses that she is a practicing Stoic—will
she thereby trigger a conversion in those who ask? Probably
not. They might think she is teasing them. Who, these days,
practices Stoicism? Or they might decide that although Stoicism
works for her, it won’t, because of personality differences, work
for them. Or they will, in all too many cases, conclude that
although it would be nice to gain the self-conﬁdence enjoyed
by the Stoics, there are other things that are even more worth
pursuing, things such as fame . . . or a life of luxury.

Personal Values
On Luxurious Living

Besides valuing fame, people typically value wealth. These
two values may seem independent, but a case can be made that
the primary reason we seek wealth is that we seek fame.1 More
precisely, we seek wealth because we realize that the material
goods our wealth can buy us will win the admiration of other
people and thereby confer on us a degree of fame. But if fame
isn’t worth pursuing, and if our primary reason for seeking
wealth is so we can gain fame, then wealth shouldn’t be worth
pursuing either. And according to the Stoics, it isn’t.
In his consolation to Helvia, for example, Seneca reminds
us how small our bodies are and poses this question: “Is it not
madness and the wildest lunacy to desire so much when you
can hold so little?” Furthermore, he says, it is folly “to think
that it is the amount of money and not the state of mind that
matters!”2 Musonius agrees with this assessment. Possessing
wealth, he observes, won’t enable us to live without sorrow
and won’t console us in our old age. And although wealth
can procure for us physical luxuries and various pleasures of
the senses, it can never bring us contentment or banish our
grief. In support of this assertion, Musonius points to all the

174 Stoic Advice

rich men who feel sad and wretched despite their wealth.3
Along similar lines, Epictetus asserts that “it is better to die
of hunger with distress and fear gone than to live upset in the
midst of plenty.”4 More generally, he argues that not needing
wealth is more valuable than wealth itself is.5
It would be bad enough if the acquisition of wealth failed
to bring people happiness, but Musonius thinks the situation
is even worse than this: Wealth has the power to make people
miserable. Indeed, if you wanted to make someone truly
miserable, you might consider showering him with wealth.
Musonius once gave a sum of money to a man who was
posing as a philosopher. When people told him that the man
was an imposter, that he was in fact a bad and vicious person,
Musonius, rather than taking the money back, let him keep it.
He said, with a smile, that if he was in fact a bad person, he
deserved the money.6
Most people use their wealth to ﬁnance a luxurious lifestyle,
one that will win them the admiration of others. But such a
lifestyle, the Stoics argued, is counterproductive if our goal is
not to live well but to have a good life.
Consider, for example, the extravagant meals associated
with luxurious living. Do those who eat such meals experience
more pleasure than those whose diets are simple? Musonius
doesn’t think so. People with extravagant diets, he says,
resemble iron that, because it is inferior, must constantly be
sharpened; more precisely, these individuals will be unhappy
with a meal unless it has been “sharpened” with unmixed
wine, vinegar, or a tart sauce.7

Personal Values: On Luxurious Living 175

There is indeed a danger that if we are exposed to a luxurious lifestyle, we will lose our ability to take delight in simple
things. At one time, we might have been able to savor a bowl
of macaroni and cheese, accompanied by a glass of milk, but
after living in luxury for a few months we might ﬁnd that macaroni no longer appeals to our discriminating palate; we might
start rejecting it in favor of fettuccine Alfredo, accompanied by
a particular brand of bottled water. And not long after that, we
might, if we can afford to do so, reject even this meal in favor
of, say, risotto with Maine sweet shrimp and just-picked squash
blossoms, accompanied by a bottle of that Riesling the critics
have been raving about, and preceded, of course, by a nice
salad of baby frisée, topped with braised artichokes, fava beans,
Valencay cheese, baby asparagus, and conﬁt cherry tomatoes.8
When, as the result of being exposed to luxurious living,
people become hard to please, a curious thing happens. Rather
than mourning the loss of their ability to enjoy simple things,
they take pride in their newly gained inability to enjoy anything
but “the best.” The Stoics, however, would pity these individuals. They would point out that by undermining their ability to
enjoy simple, easily obtainable things—bowls of macaroni and
cheese, for example—these individuals have seriously impaired
their ability to enjoy life. The Stoics work hard to avoid falling
victim to this kind of connoisseurship. Indeed, the Stoics value
highly their ability to enjoy ordinary life—and indeed, their
ability to ﬁnd sources of delight even when living in primitive
conditions.
It was partly for this reason that Musonius advocated a
simple diet. More precisely, he thought it best to eat foods

176 Stoic Advice

that needed little preparation, including fruits, green vegetables, milk, and cheese. He tried to avoid meat since it was,
he thought, a food more appropriate for wild animals. He
advised that when someone eats, he should choose food “not
for pleasure but for nourishment, not to please his palate but
to strengthen his body.” Finally, Musonius advises us to follow
the example set by Socrates: Rather than living to eat—rather
than spending our life pursuing the pleasure to be derived from
food—we should eat to live.9
Why would Musonius deprive himself of what seem like
harmless gastronomic pleasures? Because he thinks they
are anything but harmless. He recalls Zeno’s observation
that we should guard against acquiring a taste for delicacies,
because once we start in this direction, it will be difﬁcult to
stop. Another thing to keep in mind is that although we may
go months or even years between our encounters with other
sources of pleasure, we must eat daily, and that the more often
we are tempted by a pleasure, the more danger there is that we
will succumb to it. It is for this reason, Musonius says, that “the
pleasure connected with food is undoubtedly the most difﬁcult
of all pleasures to combat.”10
Besides enjoying extravagant diets, those who live in
luxury also wear expensive clothes and live in expensive, ﬁnely
furnished houses. But according to the Stoics, in the same way
that we should favor a simple diet, we should favor simple
clothing, housing, and furnishings. Musonius, for example,
advises us to dress to protect our bodies, not to impress other
people. Likewise, our housing should be functional: It should

Personal Values: On Luxurious Living 177

do little more than keep out extreme heat and cold, and shelter
us from the sun and wind. A cave would be ﬁne, if one were
available. He reminds us that houses with courtyards, fancy
color schemes, and gilded ceilings are hard to maintain.
Furthermore, our simple house should be furnished simply.
Its kitchen should be supplied with earthenware and iron
vessels rather than those made of silver and gold; besides being
cheaper, Musonius observes, such vessels are easier to cook
with and less likely to be stolen.11
People who achieve luxurious lifestyles are rarely satisﬁed: Experiencing luxury only whets their appetite for even
more luxury. In defense of this claim, Seneca asks his friend
Lucilius to imagine that he has become magniﬁcently wealthy,
that his house has marble ﬂoors and is decked with gold, and
that his clothing is royal purple. Having all this, he observes,
will not make Lucilius happy: “You will only learn from such
things to crave still greater.” This is because the desire for luxuries is not a natural desire. Natural desires, such as a desire for
water when we are thirsty, can be satisﬁed; unnatural desires
cannot.12 Therefore, when we ﬁnd ourselves wanting something, we should pause to ask whether the desire is natural or
unnatural, and if it is unnatural, we should think twice about
trying to satisfy it.
Luxury, Seneca warns, uses her wit to promote vices: First
she makes us want things that are inessential, then she makes us
want things that are injurious. Before long, the mind becomes
slave to the body’s whims and pleasures.13 Along similar lines,
Musonius tells us that he would rather be sick than live in
luxury. Sickness, he argues, may harm the body, but a life of

178 Stoic Advice

luxury harms the soul as well by making it “undisciplined and
cowardly.” Therefore, he concludes, “luxurious living must be
completely avoided.”14
If we take to heart the advice of the Stoics and forgo luxurious living, we will ﬁnd that our needs are easily met, for
as Seneca reminds us, life’s necessities are cheap and easily
obtainable.15 Those who crave luxury typically have to spend
considerable time and energy to attain it; those who eschew
luxury can devote this same time and energy to other, more
worthwhile undertakings.
How much wealth should we acquire? According to Seneca,
our ﬁnancial goal should be to acquire “an amount that does
not descend to poverty, and yet is not far removed from
poverty.” We should, he says, learn to restrain luxury, cultivate
frugality, and “view poverty with unprejudiced eyes.”16 The
lifestyle of a Stoic, he adds, should be somewhere in between
that of a sage and that of an ordinary person.17
Epictetus is more austere in the advice he offers: We should,
he said, “take what has to do with the body to the point of bare
need.” And what is it that we need? Food enough to nourish
our body, clothing enough to cover it, and a house big enough
to enclose it.18 It is worth noting that despite living a spartan
lifestyle, the Stoic, because he practices negative visualization,
might be more content with what he has than someone living
in the lap of luxury.
Epictetus encourages us to keep in mind that self-respect,
trustworthiness, and high-mindedness are more valuable
than wealth, meaning that if the only way to gain wealth is

Personal Values: On Luxurious Living 179

to give up these personal characteristics, we would be foolish
to seek wealth. Furthermore, we should remember that one
person’s being richer than another does not mean that the ﬁrst
person is better than the other.19 Likewise, we should keep in
mind Seneca’s comment to Lucilius that “the man who adapts
himself to his slender means and makes himself wealthy on
a little sum, is the truly rich man.”20 (The Stoics, by the way,
are not alone in making this observation. On the other side of
the globe, for example, Lao Tzu observed that “he who knows
contentment is rich.”)21
Even though she doesn’t pursue wealth, a Stoic might
nevertheless acquire it. A Stoic will, after all, do what she can
to make herself useful to her fellow humans. And thanks to
her practice of Stoicism, she will be self-disciplined and singleminded, traits that will help her accomplish the tasks she sets
for herself. As a result, she might be quite effective in helping
others, and they might reward her for doing so. It is possible,
in other words, for the practice of Stoicism to be ﬁnancially
rewarding.
Suppose that this Stoic—thanks, once again, to her practice
of Stoicism—has also lost interest in luxurious living and, more
generally, has overcome her craving for consumer goods. As a
result, she is likely to retain a large portion of her income and
might thereby become wealthy. It is indeed ironic: A Stoic who
disparages wealth might become wealthier than those individuals whose principal goal is its acquisition. The Roman Stoics
we have been considering appear to have experienced this prosperity paradox. Seneca and Marcus were beyond wealthy, and

180

Stoic Advice

Musonius and Epictetus, as heads of successful Stoic schools,
would presumably have been ﬁnancially comfortable. (Indeed,
Musonius’s income was sufﬁcient, as we have seen, for him to
be able to give money to a philosophical imposter.)
What will a Stoic do if, despite not pursuing wealth, she ﬁnds
herself well off ? Stoicism does not require her to renounce
wealth; it allows her to enjoy it and use it to the beneﬁt of
herself and those around her. It does, however, require her
enjoyment to be thoughtful. She must keep ﬁrmly in mind that
her wealth can be snatched from her; indeed, she should spend
time preparing herself for the loss of it—by, for example, periodically practicing poverty. She must also keep in mind that
unless she is careful, enjoyment of her wealth can undermine
her character and her capacity to enjoy life. She will, for this
reason, steer clear of a luxurious lifestyle. Thus, the Stoic’s
enjoyment of wealth will be strikingly different from that of,
say, the typical person who has just won the lottery.
We need to keep in mind the difference between the Cynics
and the Stoics. Cynicism requires its adherents to live in abject
poverty; Stoicism does not. As Seneca reminds us, Stoic philosophy “calls for plain living, but not for penance.”22 More generally, it is perfectly acceptable, says Seneca, for a Stoic to acquire
wealth, as long as he does not harm others to obtain it. It is also
acceptable for a Stoic to enjoy wealth, as long as he is careful
not to cling to it. The idea is that it is possible to enjoy something and at the same time be indifferent to it. Thus, Seneca
claims, “I shall despise riches alike when I have them and when
I have them not, being neither cast down if they shall lie elsewhere, nor puffed up if they shall glitter around me.” Indeed,

Personal Values: On Luxurious Living 181

a wise man “never reﬂects so much upon poverty as when he
abides in the midst of riches,” and he will be careful to regard
his riches as his slave, not as his master.23
(And having said this, I should add that different Stoics had
different ideas about just how heartily a Stoic should enjoy his
wealth. Musonius and Epictetus appear to have thought that
even a minimal exposure to luxurious living would corrupt us,
while Seneca and Marcus thought it possible to live in a palace
without being corrupted.)
The Buddhist viewpoint regarding wealth, by the way, is very
much like the view I have ascribed to the Stoics: It is permissible
to be a wealthy Buddhist, as long as you don’t cling to your wealth.
This, at any rate, is the advice Buddha gave to Anathapindika,
a man of “unmeasurable wealth”: “He that cleaves to wealth
had better cast it away than allow his heart to be poisoned by it;
but he who does not cleave to wealth, and possessing riches,
uses them rightly, will be a blessing unto his fellows.”24
The preceding comments about wealth, by the way, also
apply to fame. The Stoics, as we have seen, will not seek fame;
to the contrary, they will strive to be indifferent to what others
think of them. It is nevertheless possible for them to become
famous. Indeed, the four Roman Stoics we have been considering all enjoyed fame. (Musonius and Epictetus obviously
weren’t as famous as Seneca and Marcus, but they were recognized in their chosen profession, and even those Romans who
didn’t attend their schools were likely to have heard of them.)
So what should a Stoic do if, despite not seeking it, she
ﬁnds herself famous? Should she enjoy this fame, the way

182 Stoic Advice

she might enjoy the wealth she acquired, despite not having
pursued it? I think the Stoics would have been more wary of
enjoying fame than enjoying fortune. There is a danger, as we
have seen, that wealth will corrupt us, particularly if we use it
to ﬁnance luxurious living. The danger that fame will corrupt
us, however, is even greater. In particular, the glow that comes
from being famous might trigger in us a desire for even more
fame, and the obvious way to accomplish this is by saying
things and living in a manner calculated to gain the admiration
of other people. To do this, though, we will probably have to
betray our Stoic principles.
It is therefore unlikely that a Stoic will bask in any fame that
comes her way. At the same time, she will not hesitate to use
this fame as a tool in the performance of what she takes to
be her social duty. Thus, Musonius and Epictetus presumably
did not mind that their names were known to many, inasmuch
as this increased their chances of drawing students to their
schools and thereby enabled them to disseminate their Stoic
views in a more effective manner

Exile
On Surviving a Change of Place

In ancient Rome, people were sentenced to exile for a variety
of crimes, both real and imagined, and it would appear that
being a philosopher increased one’s chances of being punished
in this manner. Indeed, philosophers were expelled from Rome
at least three times: in 161 bc, again during the reign of Emperor
Vespasian, and yet again during the reign of Domitian.
If being a philosopher made one susceptible to banishment,
being a Stoic philosopher made one particularly susceptible.
By stubbornly doing what they took to be their social duty,
even though it meant defying the powers that be, the Stoics
made lots of political enemies. Of the four great Roman
Stoics, only Marcus escaped banishment—but then again, he
was the emperor. Seneca and Epictetus were each banished
once, and Musonius was banished twice. Other noteworthy
banished Stoics include Rutilius Rufus, Posidonius, Helvidius
Priscus, and Paconius Agrippinus. And these were arguably the
Stoics who got lucky. Other Stoics managed to offend those
in power sufﬁciently that, rather than being exiled, they were
sentenced to death; this was the fate of Thrasea Paetus and
Barea Soranus. (According to Tacitus, Emperor Nero’s desire

184 Stoic Advice

to kill these two Stoics can best be understood as an attempt
“to extirpate virtue herself.”)1
Paconius’s response to banishment, by the way, is a
wonderful example of a Stoical response to what most people
would take to be a personal calamity. When someone reported
to him that he was being tried in the Senate, Paconius was
uninterested; he merely set off for his daily exercise and bath.
When he was informed that he had been condemned, he asked
whether it was to banishment or death. “To banishment,”
came the reply. He then asked whether his property at Aricia
had also been conﬁscated, and when he was told that it hadn’t,
he replied, “Let us go to Aricia then and dine.” Epictetus holds
this up as a model of Stoic behavior: “This is what it means to
have rehearsed the lessons one ought to rehearse, to have set
desire and aversion free from every hindrance and made them
proof against chance. I must die. If forthwith, I die; and if a
little later, I will take lunch now, since the hour for lunch has
come, and afterwards I will die at the appointed time.”2
Philosophers, to be sure, no longer fear banishment. This is
in part because governments are more enlightened than they
used to be and in part because philosophers have succeeded in
making themselves invisible to both politicians and the public
at large. Sometimes, in idle moments, I ﬁnd myself wishing
that the government of my country would consider banishing
philosophers—or, if not banishing us, at least locking us up for
a few days to teach us a lesson. Not that I want to be banished
or want my colleagues to be banished, but the fact that a
government would consider banishing a group is evidence that
the group matters, that it somehow makes a difference in a

Exile 185

culture, a difference that might worry the authorities. What
I am really wishing, I suppose, is that philosophy mattered in
my culture the way it mattered to ancient Romans.
In chapter 12, I mentioned Seneca’s consolation to his mother
Helvia, who was upset at his being exiled. In the consolation,
Seneca comforts her by telling her that exile isn’t really that
bad—not as bad, at any rate, as people make it out to be. Exile,
he explains, is nothing but a change of place. Furthermore,
even in the worst places of exile, the exiled person will ﬁnd
people who are there of their own free will.3
It may be true, says Seneca, that by being exiled he has been
deprived of his country, his friends and family, and his property,
but he has taken with him into exile the things that matter
most: his place in Nature and his virtue. He adds, “It is the
mind that makes us rich; this goes with us into exile, and in the
wildest wilderness, having found there all that the body needs
for its sustenance, it itself overﬂows in the enjoyment of its
own goods.”4 Seneca apparently spent his time in exile reading,
writing, and studying nature.
Musonius’s exile, as we have seen, was one of the worst
exiles possible, to the “worthless” island of Gyara. Nevertheless,
he says, those who visited him during his exile never heard
him complain or saw him disheartened. Being exiled may
have deprived him of his country, but it didn’t deprive him,
he says, of his ability to endure exile. Indeed, Musonius thinks
exile deprives a person of nothing that is truly valuable. Exile
cannot prevent us, for example, from being courageous or just.
If we are virtuous—if we have the proper values—exile cannot

186 Stoic Advice

harm or degrade us. If we are not virtuous, though, exile will
deprive us of much of what we (mistakenly) think is valuable,
and we will therefore be miserable.5
To endure and even thrive in exile, Musonius says, a person
must keep in mind that his happiness depends more on his
values than on where he resides. Indeed, Musonius views
himself as a citizen not of Rome but of “the city of Zeus which
is populated by human beings and gods.”6 He points out that
even in exile we can associate with others and that our true
friends will not refuse to associate with us just because we have
been exiled. If those in exile ﬁnd themselves lacking things, he
asserts, it is because they seek to live in luxury. Furthermore,
those in exile have something that those in Rome lack—namely,
freedom to speak their mind.
Musonius also reminds us that exile has changed people for
the better. It has, for example, forced people to curtail their
luxurious living and has thereby improved their health. It has
also transformed ordinary people, such as Diogenes of Sinope,
into philosophers.7 (Before becoming a Cynic, Diogenes had
been forced to ﬂee Sinope because either he or his banker
father had adulterated the coinage there; when someone
later brought up this incident in an attempt to shame him,
Diogenes, with typical Cynic wit, responded that although it
was true that the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile,
he in turn had sentenced them to remain in Sinope.)8
It is clear why the Stoics had an interest in exile: As we have
seen, they ran an interesting chance of being sentenced to it.
People no longer live in fear of being exiled by their govern-

Exile 187

ment, so it might seem as if the Stoic advice on exile is of theoretical and historical interest only. But this is not so.
Even though readers of this book are unlikely to be exiled
by their government, they run a considerable risk, if current
social trends continue, of being exiled by their children—
exiled, that is, to a nursing home. It is a transition that, if they
let it, can severely disrupt their tranquility. Indeed, there is a
very real danger that this exile will cause them to spend their
ﬁnal, precious days on earth complaining about their life rather
than enjoying it. In the next chapter, we will turn our attention
to this special kind of exile and to other problems associated
with aging.

SEVENT EEN

Old Age
On Being Banished to a Nursing Home

As a college professor, I spend my days around twentyyear-olds. Many of them, I have found, are convinced that the
world will be their oyster. They think they will be rock stars,
either literally or ﬁguratively speaking. (It is understandable that they would think this. What perplexes me is their
belief that, as rock stars, they will ﬁnd profound and lasting
happiness. They need, perhaps, to follow the entertainment
news more closely.) These twentysomethings aren’t willing
to settle for “mere tranquility” when there is so much else
to be had: a perfect boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse, a perfect
job, and the love and admiration of all those around them.
For them, Stoicism sounds like a philosophy for losers, and
they aren’t losers.
In extreme cases, these young people harbor a profound
sense of entitlement. They think it is life’s job to unroll a
red carpet ahead of them, down whatever path they choose
to take. When life fails to do this—when the path they have
chosen gets bumpy and rutted, or even becomes impassible—
they are astonished. This isn’t how things are supposed to be!
Surely someone, somewhere, has made a terrible mistake!

Old Age 189

As the years go by, though, these twentysomethings come to
realize that life will present them with obstacles, and they start
developing skill at overcoming those obstacles. In particular,
when the world does not hand them fame and fortune on a
silver platter, they realize that they must work to get it, and so
they do. Often, the world rewards their efforts, and as a result,
they ﬁnd that when they are in their thirties, their external
circumstances, although not quite what they had hoped they
would be when they were twenty, are nevertheless tolerable.
At this point, they often redouble their efforts to improve their
external circumstances in the belief that this will somehow
gain them the perfect life they dream of having.
After trying this strategy for another decade, though, it
might dawn on them that they aren’t gaining any ground.
They are getting paid twenty times more than they once were,
they are living in a four-bedroom house instead of a studio
apartment, and they are the subject of adulatory articles in the
newspaper, but they are no closer to happiness than they used
to be. Indeed, thanks to the complexity of their schemes for
gaining happiness, they ﬁnd themselves experiencing anxiety,
anger, and frustration. They also discover that their success has
a downside: They have become the target of other people’s
envy. It is at this stage that many people who were formerly
oblivious to philosophy start getting philosophical. “Is this all
life has to offer?” they wonder. “Is this the life I want to live?”
Sometimes this period of philosophical speculation triggers
what, in our culture, we call a midlife crisis. The person experiencing the crisis might sensibly conclude that his unhappiness
is the result of wanting the wrong things. In all too many cases,

190 Stoic Advice

though, he doesn’t draw this conclusion; instead, he concludes
that he is unhappy as the result of making certain short-term
sacrifices to attain various long-term goals. He therefore
decides to stop making these short-term sacriﬁces: He buys
a new car, or abandons his wife and takes on a lover. After a
time, though, it becomes apparent to him that this strategy for
gaining happiness is no better and is in many ways worse than
his previous strategy.
He might, at this point, turn his attention back to meaningof-life questions. And if this isn’t sufﬁcient to make him take up
such questions, the aging process—and along with it, the prospect of death drawing ever nearer—probably will. As a result
of contemplating these questions, he might ﬁnd that Stoicism,
which held no appeal whatsoever for him when he was young,
now seems plausible as a philosophy of life.
When we were young, we might have wondered what it
would be like to be old. And if we are Stoics, we might, in our
practice of negative visualization, have imagined what it would
be like. Unless death intervenes, though, a day will come when
we won’t need to wonder or imagine what it would be like
to be old; we will know full well. The abilities we once took
for granted will have departed. We used to run for miles; now
we get winded walking down the hallway. We used to handle
the ﬁnances of a corporation; now we can’t even balance our
checkbook. We used to be the person who knew when everyone’s birthday was; now we can’t even remember our own.
The loss of these abilities means we can no longer fend for
ourselves, and as a result we might ﬁnd ourselves banished to

Old Age 191

a nursing home. The home in question will not, to be sure, be
a desolate island like the one to which Musonius was banished.
Indeed, it will be physically quite comfortable, with regular
meals and someone to do our laundry, clean our room, and
maybe even help us bathe. But although our new environment
is physically comfortable, it is likely to be quite challenging
socially. We will ﬁnd ourselves surrounded by people not of
our choosing. We might, as a result, have to interact, each and
every day, over breakfast and before we have had our coffee,
with the same ornery individuals. We might ﬁnd that despite
having enjoyed a high degree of social status in our prime, we
are now low man on the nursing home’s status totem pole; it
might turn out, for example, that there is a “cool table” in the
nursing home’s dining room, and we have not been invited to
sit there.
Living in a nursing home resembles, in many respects, being
in high school. Cliques form, and their members spend considerable amounts of time talking down the members of rival
cliques. In other respects, it resembles living in a college dorm:
You are in a single room that opens onto a communal corridor;
you can either stay in your room and stare at the four walls, or
venture out of your room into an environment you might ﬁnd
socially challenging.
Living in a nursing home also resembles living in a time of
plague: You watch as the ambulance pulls up a few times each
month—or, in a large home, a few times each week—to haul
away the bodies of those who did not survive the night. If you
don’t live in a nursing home, you will be spared these recurring
ambulances, but you probably won’t be spared learning of the

192 Stoic Advice

deaths of long-time friends, brothers and sisters, and perhaps
even your own children.
A twenty-year-old might reject Stoicism in the belief that
the world is going to be her oyster; an eighty-year-old knows
full well that the world isn’t her oyster and that her situation is
only going to worsen with the passing years. Although she may
have believed she was immortal when she was twenty, her own
mortality is now painfully obvious to her. Faced with death,
she might ﬁnally be willing to settle for “mere tranquility,” and
she might, as a result, be ripe for Stoicism.
Having said this, I should add that it is entirely possible to
grow old without becoming ripe for Stoicism or any other
philosophy of life. Indeed, many people go through life repeatedly making the same mistakes and are no closer to happiness
in their eighties than they were in their twenties. These individuals, rather than enjoying their life, will have been embittered by it, and now, near the end of their life, they live to
complain—about their circumstances, their relatives, the food,
the weather, in short, about absolutely everything.
Such cases are tragic inasmuch as these people had it in their
power—and, indeed, still have it in their power—to experience
joy, but they either chose the wrong goals in living, or chose
the right goals but adopted a defective strategy to attain those
goals. This is the downside of failing to develop an effective
philosophy of life: You end up wasting the one life you have.
Old age, Seneca argues, has its beneﬁts: “Let us cherish and
love old age; for it is full of pleasure if one knows how to use
it.” Indeed, he claims that the most delightful time of life is

Old Age 193

“when it is on the downward slope, but has not yet reached
the abrupt decline.” He adds that even the time of “abrupt
decline” has pleasures of its own. Most signiﬁcantly, as one
loses the ability to experience certain pleasures, one loses the
desire to experience them: “How comforting it is,” he says, “to
have tired out one’s appetites, and to have done with them!”1
Consider lust, the desire for sexual gratiﬁcation. Lust is, for
many people—and for males in particular, I think—a major
distraction in daily living. We might be able to control whether
or not we act on lustful feelings, but the feelings themselves
seem to be hardwired into us. (If we lacked such feelings or
could easily extinguish them, it is unlikely that we would have
survived as a species.) Because they distract us, feelings of lust
have a signiﬁcant impact on how we spend our days.
As we age, though, our feelings of lust and the state of distraction that accompanies them diminish. Some would argue that
this is a bad thing, that it is yet another example of one of the
pleasures of youth that is lost to us. But the Greek dramatist
Sophocles offered another viewpoint. When he had grown old
and someone asked whether, despite his years, he could still make
love to a woman, he replied, “I am very glad to have escaped from
this, like a slave who has escaped from a mad and cruel master.”2
Seneca points out that by causing our bodies to deteriorate,
old age causes our vices and their accessories to decay. The
same aging process, though, needn’t cause our mind to decay;
indeed, Seneca remarks that despite his age, his mind “is strong
and rejoices that it has but slight connexion with the body.”
He is also thankful that his mind has thereby “laid aside the
greater part of its load.”3

194 Stoic Advice

One downside of being old is that we live in the knowledge
that our death is in some sense imminent. In our youth, we
delude ourselves into thinking death is for other people. By
our middle years, we understand that we are going to die, but
we also expect to live for decades before we do. When we are
old, we know full well that we will die—maybe not tomorrow
but soon. For many people, this knowledge makes old age a
depressing stage of life.
The Stoics, however, thought the prospect of death, rather
than depressing us, could make our days far more enjoyable
than would otherwise be the case. We examined this seeming
paradox back in chapter 4. We saw that by imagining how our
days could go worse—and in particular, by contemplating our
own death—we could increase our chance of experiencing joy.
In our youth, it takes effort to contemplate our own death; in
our later years, it takes effort to avoid contemplating it. Old age
therefore has a way of making us do something that, according
to the Stoics, we should have been doing all along.
Thus, the proximity of death, rather than depressing us,
can be turned to our advantage. In our youth, because we
assumed that we would live forever, we took our days for
granted and as a result wasted many of them. In our old age,
however, waking up each morning can be a cause for celebration. As Seneca notes, “If God is pleased to add another
day, we should welcome it with glad hearts.”4 And after celebrating having been given another day to live, we can ﬁll
that day with appreciative living. It is entirely possible for
an octogenarian to be more joyful than her twenty-year-old
grandchild, particularly if the octogenarian, in part because

Old Age 195

of her failing health, takes nothing for granted, while the
grandchild, in part because of her perfect health, takes
everything for granted and has therefore decided that life is
a bore.
Among the various philosophies of life, Stoicism is particularly well suited to our later years. For most people, old age
will be the most challenging time of life. A primary objective of Stoicism, though, is to teach us not only to meet life’s
challenges but to retain our tranquility as we do. In addition,
old people are more likely than young people to value the
tranquility offered by the Stoics. A young person might ﬁnd
it bafﬂing that someone would be willing to settle for “mere
tranquility”; an octogenarian will probably not only appreciate
how precious a thing tranquility is but will realize how few
people manage, over the course of a lifetime, to attain it.
It is in part for this reason that Musonius counsels us to take
up Stoicism while we are young: It is, he thinks, the best way
to prepare for old age. Someone who has acted on this advice
will be unlikely, as he gets older, to complain about the loss
of youth and its pleasures, his body growing weak, his failing
health, or being neglected by his relatives, since he would have
“an effective antidote against all these things in his own intelligence and in the education he possesses.”5
If someone neglected to study Stoicism in his youth, though,
he can always take it up later in life. The aging process might
prevent us from, say, boxing or solving differential equations,
but only rarely will it prevent us from practicing Stoicism. Even
those who are old and feeble can read the Stoics and reﬂect on

196 Stoic Advice

their writings. They can also engage in negative visualization
and refuse to worry about things that are beyond their control.
And perhaps most important, they can take a fatalistic attitude
toward their life and refuse to spend their ﬁnal years wishing,
pointlessly, that it could have been different than it was.

EIGHT EEN

Dying
On a Good End to a Good Life

What makes old age a miserable thing, Musonius says,
usually isn’t the frailty or sickness that accompanies it;
rather, it is the prospect of dying.1 And why are people, both
young and old, disturbed by the prospect of dying? Some are
disturbed because they fear what might come after death.
Many more, though, are disturbed because they fear that
they have mislived—that they have, that is, lived without
having attained the things in life that are truly valuable.
Death, of course, will make it impossible for them ever to
attain these things.
It may seem paradoxical, but having a coherent philosophy
of life, whether it be Stoicism or some other philosophy, can
make us more accepting of death. Someone with a coherent
philosophy of life will know what in life is worth attaining,
and because this person has spent time trying to attain the
thing in life he believed to be worth attaining, he has probably attained it, to the extent that it was possible for him to
do so. Consequently, when it comes time for him to die, he
will not feel cheated. To the contrary, he will, in the words of
Musonius, “be set free from the fear of death.”2

198 Stoic Advice

Consider, by way of illustration, the last days of the Stoic
philosopher Julius Canus. When Caligula, whom Canus had
angered, ordered his death, Canus retained his composure:
“Most excellent prince,” he said, “I tender you my thanks.” Ten
days later, when a centurion came to take him to be executed,
Canus was playing a board game. Rather than complaining
bitterly about his fate or begging the centurion to spare his
life, Canus simply pointed out to the centurion that he, Canus,
was one piece ahead in the game—meaning that his opponent
would be lying if he subsequently claimed to have won. On the
way to his execution, when someone asked about his state of
mind, Canus replied that he was preparing himself to observe
the moment of death in order to learn whether, in that moment,
the spirit is aware that it is leaving the body. “Here,” says Seneca
approvingly, “is tranquility in the very midst of the storm.” He
adds that “no one has ever played the philosopher longer.”3
Those who have lived without a coherent philosophy of life,
though, will desperately want to delay death. They might want
the delay so that they can get the thing that—at last!—they have
discovered to be of value. (It is unfortunate that this dawned
on them so late in life, but, as Seneca observes, “what you have
done in the past will be manifest only at the time when you
draw your last breath.”)4 Or they might want the delay because
their improvised philosophy of life has convinced them that
what is worth having in life is more of everything, and they
cannot get more of everything if they die.
At this point, readers might conclude that the Stoics were
obsessed with death. They counsel us, as we have seen, to

Dying 199

contemplate our own death. They tell us to live each day as if
it were our last. They tell us to practice Stoicism in part so we
will not fear death.
Besides being seemingly ﬁxated on death while alive, the
Stoics had an unfortunate tendency to die in an unnatural
manner. The Greek Stoics Zeno and Cleanthes apparently
committed suicide,5 and Cato unquestionably did so. It isn’t
clear how Musonius died, but while alive, he was an advocate
of suicide. In particular, he advised old people to “choose to
die well while you can; wait too long, and it might become
impossible to do so.” He added, “It is better to die with distinction than to live long.”6
Furthermore, many of those Stoics who did not commit
suicide outright did things that hastened their death. When
it seemed that death was near, Marcus refused to eat. Seneca
behaved in a manner that brought on a death sentence when he
could have avoided doing so, as did the Stoics Thrasea Paetus
and Barea Soranus. After hearing about how these Stoics met
their end, readers might conclude that anyone who loves life and
wants to die a natural death would do well to avoid Stoicism.
In response to this concern, let me point out, to begin with,
that it is unclear that the rate of unnatural deaths among the
Stoics was unusually high for ancient times. Furthermore,
in many of the cases in which the Stoics did things to hasten
their death, it is understandable why they did so. In particular,
it is possible that Zeno and Cleanthes, who lived to an advanced age, didn’t so much “commit suicide” as self-euthanize:
They might have been incurably ill and might therefore
have taken steps to hasten death. (This is what Marcus had

200 Stoic Advice

done.) And although it is true that Cato committed suicide
while in his prime, he did so not because he was indifferent
to life but because he knew that his staying alive would have
been politically advantageous to Julius Caesar, the dictator
he was trying to overthrow. What we don’t ﬁnd, when we
examine the lives of the Stoics, is individuals who committed
suicide on a whim or out of boredom with life, the way a
nihilist might.
Furthermore, when Stoics contemplate their own death, it
is not because they long for death but because they want to
get the most out of life. As we have seen, someone who thinks
he will live forever is far more likely to waste his days than
someone who fully understands that his days are numbered,
and one way to gain this understanding is periodically to
contemplate his own death. Likewise, when the Stoics live each
day as if it were their last, it is not because they plan to take
steps to make that day their last; rather, it is so they can extract
the full value of that day—and, hopefully, the days that follow
it. And when the Stoics teach us not to fear death, they are
simply giving us advice on how to avoid a negative emotion.
We are all going to die, after all, and it is better that our death
not be marred by fear.
It is also important to keep in mind that the Stoics thought
suicide was permissible only under certain circumstances.
Musonius tells us, for example, that it is wrong for us to
choose to die if our living “is helpful to many.”7 Inasmuch
as Stoics, in doing what they take to be their social duty, will
be helpful to many, they will rarely ﬁnd themselves in these
circumstances.

Dying 201

Along these lines, let us reconsider Musonius’s comment
that old people who know death to be near should consider
suicide. This is a case that seems to meet the condition just
described: It is unlikely, after all, that others would depend for
their well-being on an old and sickly individual. Furthermore,
in such cases the question isn’t whether the person will soon
die; the question is whether hers will be a good death at her
own hands or a pointlessly painful death through natural
processes. Besides counseling us to live a good life, Musonius
counsels us to end that good life with a good death, when it is
possible to do so.
Let me make one last comment about the Stoics’ views
regarding death. We have seen that the Stoics were inclined
to take principled stands against powerful people and thereby
get themselves into trouble. Why take such stands? For one
thing, the Stoics thought they had a social duty to take them.
Furthermore, because they feared neither death nor exile, the
prospect of being punished for taking such stands—a prospect
that would have deterred ordinary people—didn’t deter them.
To many modern individuals, such behavior is inexplicable.
They feel this way in part because to them, nothing is worth
dying for. Indeed, they focus their energy not on doing their
duty regardless of the consequences and not on taking principled stands that could get them into trouble, but on doing
whatever it takes to go on enjoying the pleasures life has to
offer. The Stoics, I am convinced, would respond to such
thinking by asking whether a life in which nothing is worth
dying for can possibly be worth living.

On Becoming a Stoic
Start Now and Prepare to Be Mocked

Practicing Stoicism won’t be easy. It will take effort, for
example, to practice negative visualization, and practicing selfdenial will take more effort still. It will take both effort and
willpower to abandon our old goals, such as the attainment of
fame and fortune, and replace them with a new goal, namely,
the attainment of tranquility.
Some people, on hearing that it would take effort on their
part to practice a philosophy of life, will immediately dismiss
the idea. The Stoics would respond to this rejection by pointing
out that although it indeed takes effort to practice Stoicism,
it will require considerably more effort not to practice it.
Along these lines, Musonius observes, as we have seen, that
the time and energy people expend on illicit love affairs far
outweighs the time and energy it would take them, as practicing Stoics, to develop the self-control required to avoid such
affairs. Musonius goes on to suggest that we would also be
better off if, instead of working hard to become wealthy, we
trained ourselves to be satisﬁed with what we have; if, instead
of seeking fame, we overcame our craving for the admiration of others; if, instead of spending time scheming to harm

On Becoming a Stoic 203

someone we envy, we spent that time overcoming our feelings of envy; and if, instead of knocking ourselves out trying
to become popular, we worked to maintain and improve our
relationships with those we knew to be true friends.1
More generally, having a philosophy of life, whether it be
Stoicism or some other philosophy, can dramatically simplify
everyday living. If you have a philosophy of life, decision making
is relatively straightforward: When choosing between the options
life offers, you simply choose the one most likely to help you
attain the goals set forth by your philosophy of life. In the absence
of a philosophy of life, though, even relatively simple choices
can degenerate into meaning-of-life crises. It is, after all, hard to
know what to choose when you aren’t really sure what you want.
The most important reason for adopting a philosophy of
life, though, is that if we lack one, there is a danger that we will
mislive—that we will spend our life pursuing goals that aren’t
worth attaining or will pursue worthwhile goals in a foolish
manner and will therefore fail to attain them.
Anyone wishing to become a Stoic should do so unobtrusively.
This is because those who hear of your “conversion” to Stoicism
will likely mock you.2 You can avoid this sort of harassment,
though, by keeping a low philosophical proﬁle and practicing what
might be called stealth Stoicism. You should have as your model
Socrates, who kept such a low proﬁle that people would come
to him, not realizing that he himself was a philosopher, and ask
whether he could introduce them to any philosophers. Socrates
was, Epictetus reminds us, “tolerant of being overlooked,”3 and
those practicing Stoicism should likewise be tolerant.

204 Stoic Advice

Why do people behave this way? Why do they mock someone
for adopting a philosophy of life? In part because by adopting
one, whether it be Stoicism or some rival philosophy, a person
is demonstrating that he has different values than they do. They
might therefore infer that he thinks their values are somehow
mistaken, which is something people don’t want to hear.
Furthermore, by adopting a philosophy of life, he is, in effect,
challenging them to do something they are probably reluctant to
do: reﬂect on their life and how they are living it. If these people
can get the convert to abandon his philosophy of life, the implied
challenge will vanish, and so they set about mocking him in an
attempt to make him rejoin the unreﬂecting masses.
What will be our reward for practicing Stoicism? According
to the Stoics, we can hope to become more virtuous, in the
ancient sense of the word. We will also, they say, experience
fewer negative emotions, such as anger, grief, disappointment,
and anxiety, and because of this we will enjoy a degree of tranquility that previously would have been unattainable. Along
with avoiding negative emotions, we will increase our chances
of experiencing one particularly signiﬁcant positive emotion:
delight in the world around us.
For most people, experiencing delight requires a change in
circumstances; they might, for example, have to acquire a new
consumer gadget. Stoics, in contrast, can experience delight
without any such change; because they practice negative
visualization, they will deeply appreciate the things they already
have. Furthermore, for most people, the delight they experience will be somewhat clouded by the fear that they will lose

On Becoming a Stoic 205

the source of their delight. Stoics, however, have a three-part
strategy for minimizing this fear or avoiding it altogether.
To begin with, they will do their best to enjoy things that
can’t be taken from them, most notably their character. Along
these lines, consider Marcus’s comment that if we fall victim
to a catastrophe, we can still take delight in the fact that it has
not, because of the character we possess, made us bitter.4
Furthermore, as they are enjoying things that can be taken
from them—the Stoics, as we have seen, are not averse to
doing this—they will simultaneously be preparing for the loss
of those things. In particular, as part of our practice of negative visualization, say the Stoics, we need to keep in mind that
it is a lucky accident that we are enjoying whatever it is we are
enjoying, that our enjoyment of it might end abruptly, and that
we might never be able to enjoy it again. We need, in other
words, to learn how to enjoy things without feeling entitled to
them and without clinging to them.
Finally, the Stoics are careful to avoid becoming connoisseurs in the worst sense of the word—becoming, that is, individuals who are incapable of taking delight in anything but
“the best.” As a result, they will be capable of enjoying a wide
range of easily obtainable things. They will keep ﬁrmly in
mind Seneca’s comment that although “to have whatsoever
he wishes is in no man’s power,” it is in every man’s power
“not to wish for what he has not, but cheerfully to employ
what comes to him.”5 Thus, if life should snatch one source
of delight from them, Stoics will quickly find another to
take its place: Stoic enjoyment, unlike that of a connoisseur,
is eminently transferable. Along these lines, remember that

206 Stoic Advice

when Seneca and Musonius were banished to islands, rather
than succumbing to depression, they set about studying their
new environment.
Because they have learned to enjoy things that are easily
obtainable or that can’t be taken from them, Stoics will ﬁnd
much in life to enjoy. They might, as a result, discover that they
enjoy being the person they are, living the life they are living,
in the universe they happen to inhabit. This, I should add, is no
small accomplishment.
Stoics might also ﬁnd that besides enjoying things in life,
they enjoy the mere fact of being alive; they experience, in
other words, joy itself. The Stoic sage will apparently be able
to experience this joy all the time.6 Those of us whose practice
of Stoicism is less than perfect will not; instead, the joy we
experience can best be described as intermittent. It will nevertheless be signiﬁcantly greater than the joy we had previously
known—again, no small accomplishment.
When should we begin our practice of Stoicism? Epictetus
makes the case for starting immediately. We are no longer children, he says, and yet we procrastinate. Keep this up and we
will one day realize that we have grown old without having
acquired a philosophy of life—and that, as a result, we have
wasted our life. Practicing Stoicism, he adds, is like training
for the Olympics but with one important difference: Whereas
the Olympic contests for which we might train will be held at
some future date, the contest that is our life has already begun.
Consequently, we do not have the luxury of postponing our
training; we must start it this very day.7

The Decline of Stoicism

Marcus Aurelius was simultaneously a Stoic philosopher
and, as Roman emperor, the most powerful man in the
Western world. This confluence of philosophy and politics could have been quite beneﬁcial to Stoicism, but as we
have seen, he did not try to convert his fellow Romans to
the philosophy. As a result, Marcus became, in the words of
the nineteenth-century historian W. E. H. Lecky, “the last
and most perfect representative of Roman Stoicism.”1 After
his death, Stoicism fell into a slump from which it has yet to
recover.
As is the case with any complex social phenomenon, several
factors lay behind this decline. For example, Lecky (whose
views, I have been told, have fallen out of favor) argued that
the increasing corruption and depravity of Roman society
made Stoicism—which, as we have seen, calls for considerable self-control—unattractive to many Romans.2 The classicist M. L. Clarke offers a different explanation: Stoicism, he
suggests, declined in part because of a lack of charismatic
teachers of Stoicism after the death of Epictetus.3 Many people
are capable of describing the principles of a philosophy in a

210 Stoicism for Modern Lives

coherent fashion, but one of the things that made Stoicism a
vital force was that teachers such as Musonius and Epictetus,
besides being able to explain Stoicism, were in a sense embodiments of the doctrine. They were living proof that Stoicism, if
practiced, would yield the beneﬁts the Stoics promised. When
Stoicism was taught by mere mortals, potential pupils were
much less likely to be swept away by it.
Stoicism was also undermined by the rise of Christianity,
in part because the claims made by Christianity were similar
to those made by Stoicism. The Stoics claimed, for example,
that the gods created man, care about man’s well-being, and
gave him a divine element (the ability to reason); the Christians
claimed that God created man, cares about him in a very
personal way, and gave him a divine element (a soul). Stoicism
and Christianity both enjoined people to overcome unwholesome desires and to pursue virtue. And Marcus’s advice that
we “love mankind” was certainly echoed in Christianity.4
Because of these similarities, Stoics and Christians found
themselves competing for the same potential adherents. In this
competition, however, Christianity had one big advantage
over Stoicism: It promised not just life after death but an afterlife in which one would be inﬁnitely satisﬁed for an eternity.
The Stoics, on the other hand, thought it possible that there
was life after death but were not certain of it, and if there was
indeed life after death, the Stoics were uncertain what it would
be like.
Since the death of Marcus, Stoicism has led an underground
existence, only occasionally emerging into the light of day. In

The Decline of Stoicism 211

the seventeenth century, for example, René Descartes revealed
his Stoic leanings in his Discourse on Method. At one point
he describes the maxims that, if followed, would enable him
to live as happily as was possible. The third of these maxims
could have been—indeed, probably was—lifted straight out
of Epictetus: “Always to seek to conquer myself rather than
fortune, to change my desires rather than the established order,
and generally to believe that nothing except our thoughts is
wholly under our control, so that after we have done our best
in external matters, what remains to be done is absolutely
impossible, at least as far as we are concerned.”5 (Notice, by
the way, the internalization of goals implied in Descartes’
comment about doing our best.)
In the nineteenth century, the inﬂuence of Stoicism could
be found in the writings of the German philosopher Arthur
Schopenhauer; his essays “Wisdom of Life” and “Counsels
and Maxims,” although not explicitly Stoical, have a distinctly
Stoical tone. At this same time, across the Atlantic, the inﬂuence of Stoicism could be found in the writings of the New
England Transcendentalists. Henry David Thoreau, for
example, doesn’t directly mention Stoicism or any of the great
Stoics in Walden, his masterpiece, but to those who know
what to look for, the Stoic inﬂuence is present. In his Journal,
Thoreau is more forthcoming. He writes, for example, that
“Zeno the Stoic stood in precisely the same relation to the
world that I do now.”6
Like the Stoics, Thoreau was interested in developing a
philosophy of life. According to the Thoreau scholar Robert
D. Richardson, “His was always the practical question, how best

212 Stoicism for Modern Lives

can I live my daily life?,” and his life itself can best be understood, says Richardson, as “one long uninterrupted attempt to
work out the practical concrete meaning of the stoic idea that
the laws which rule nature rule men as well.”7 Thoreau went
to Walden Pond to conduct his famous two-year experiment
in simple living in large part so that he could reﬁne his philosophy of life and thereby avoid misliving: A primary motive in
going to Walden, he tells us, was his fear that he would, “when
I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”8
Some of his friends and neighbors, who might or might not
have been aware of his attraction to Stoicism, accused Thoreau
of being stoical—of being, that is, grim and unfeeling. The
accusation, Richardson argues, is unfounded. Although it
may not have been obvious to those around him, Thoreau
appears to have experienced the joy the Stoics sought. Thus,
we ﬁnd Thoreau declaring that “surely joy is the condition of
life.”9 And Thoreau’s Journal, says Richardson, “is ﬁlled with
comments reﬂecting his gusto, his appetite for experience, the
keenness of his senses, the sheer joy of being alive.”10
During most of the twentieth century, Stoicism was a
neglected doctrine. Indeed, according to the philosopher
Martha Nussbaum, twentieth-century philosophers, in both
Europe and North America, made less use of Stoicism and
the other Hellenistic philosophies—namely, Epicureanism and
Skepticism—than “almost any other philosophical culture in
the West since the fourth century B.C.E.”11 By the turn of the
millennium, Stoicism was, for most people, a nonstarter as a
philosophy of life. For one thing, they saw no need to live in
accordance with a philosophy. And those enlightened individ-

The Decline of Stoicism 213

uals who did seek a philosophy of life rarely regarded Stoicism
as a viable candidate. They were convinced that they knew what
Stoicism was: a doctrine whose adherents are humorless, grim,
and unfeeling. Who would voluntarily join such a crowd?
If this book has done its job, readers will appreciate how
woefully mistaken this characterization of Stoicism is. The
Stoics were not stoical! Nor did they live joyless lives! Indeed,
they were probably more likely to experience joy than most
non-Stoics.
This realization, though, is rarely sufﬁcient to overcome
people’s aversion toward Stoicism. Even after they acknowledge that the Stoics were fully functional individuals, capable
of joy and worthy of our admiration, they retain a degree of
hostility toward the doctrine. Let us now explore some of the
reasons for the modern aversion to Stoicism, beginning with
the argument that if modern psychology is right, Stoicism is a
misguided philosophy of life.
The Stoics had many important psychological insights. They
realized, for example, that what makes insults painful is our
interpretation of the insults rather than the insults themselves.
They also realized that by engaging in negative visualization we
can convince ourselves to be happy with what we already have
and thereby counteract our tendency toward insatiability.
Anti-Stoics might concede that these are important
insights but go on to point out that a lot has happened in the
two millennia since the Roman Stoics pondered the human
psyche. In particular, the twentieth century witnessed the
transformation of psychology into a proper scientiﬁc discipline.

214

Stoicism for Modern Lives

Anti-Stoics might add that among the most signiﬁcant psychological discoveries made in the past hundred years was the realization of the danger we pose to ourselves if we try to conquer
our emotions, the way the Stoics did. Indeed, the consensus
view among psychological therapists is that we should stay in
touch with our emotions: Rather than trying to deny their existence, we should contemplate them, and rather than trying to
bottle them up, we should vent them. And if we ﬁnd ourselves
disturbed by negative emotions, we should not attempt to deal
with them on our own but should instead share them with a
psychological counselor who has made it her business to understand how the human mind works.
By way of illustration, consider grief. Modern psychology
has shown (anti-Stoics will explain) that grief is a perfectly
natural response to a personal tragedy. A grief-stricken person
should vent his grief, not suppress it. If he feels like crying, he
should cry. He should share his feelings with friends and relatives and should probably even seek the assistance of a professional grief counselor who will periodically meet with him,
talk to him about his grief, and help him work through it. If
he instead follows the advice of the Stoics and tries to suppress
his grief, he may spare himself anguish in the short term, but
he sets himself up for a debilitating episode of “delayed grief ”
months or even years later.
It is doubtless true that some people, under some circumstances, can benefit greatly from grief counseling. The
consensus view among psychologists, though, is that nearly
everyone can beneﬁt, and this belief has transformed the way
authorities respond to natural and manmade disasters. These

The Decline of Stoicism 215

days, after doing what they can to save lives, authorities are
quick to call in grief counselors to help those who survived
the disaster, those who lost loved ones in it, and those who
witnessed it. When, for example, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City was bombed in 1995, killing 168, a
horde of grief counselors descended on the city to help people
work through their grief. Likewise, in 1999, when three dozen
people were shot by two rampaging students at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colorado, a team of grief counselors
was brought in to help the surviving students, their parents,
and members of the community deal with their grief.12
It is instructive to contrast these responses to disaster with
the way authorities responded to disasters in the middle of the
twentieth century. When, for example, a landslide of coal-mine
waste buried a village school in Aberfan, South Wales, in 1966,
the parents of the 116 children who died were left to deal with
their grief on their own.13 As a result, many of them simply
bore the disaster with, as the British say, a stiff upper lip. By the
end of the century, one would have been hard-pressed to ﬁnd
a psychological therapist who would recommend a stiff upper
lip as an appropriate response to disaster.
In reply to this criticism of Stoic psychology, let me remind
readers that despite widespread belief to the contrary, the
Stoics did not advocate that we “bottle up” our emotions. They
did advise us to take steps to prevent negative emotions and to
overcome them when our attempts at prevention fail, but this
is different from keeping them bottled up: If we prevent or
overcome an emotion, there will be nothing to bottle.

216 Stoicism for Modern Lives

Suppose, in particular, that a Stoic ﬁnds himself grieving
the loss of a loved one. This Stoic, it should be noted, will not
react by trying to stiﬂe the grief within him—by pretending,
for example, that he is not grieving or by grimacing to block
the ﬂow of tears. He will instead recall Seneca’s comment to
Polybius that when people experience personal catastrophes,
it is perfectly natural to experience grief. After this bout of
reﬂexive grief, though, a Stoic will try to dispel whatever grief
remains in him by trying to reason it out of existence. He will,
in particular, invoke the kinds of arguments Seneca used in his
consolations: “Is this what the person who died would want
me to do? Of course not! She would want me to be happy! The
best way to honor her memory is to leave off grieving and get
on with life.”
Because grief is a negative emotion, the Stoics opposed
it. At the same time, they realized that because we are mere
mortals, some grief is inevitable in the course of a lifetime, as
are some fear, some anxiety, some anger, some hatred, some
humiliation, and some envy. The goal of the Stoics was therefore not to eliminate grief but to minimize it.
An anti-Stoic might at this point suggest that the goal
of minimizing grief, although less misguided than the goal of
suppressing it, remains misguided. According to psychological
counselors, we should work through our grief. It is true that
trying to reason our way out of grieving is one way to work
through it, but a better way is to try to elicit from ourselves
various grief-related behaviors; we might, for example, make a
point of having a good cry even though we don’t particularly

The Decline of Stoicism 217

feel like doing so. We might also make a point of talking to
others about our grief, even though this kind of sharing of
emotions doesn’t come naturally to us. Most important, if our
grief is signiﬁcant, we will seek the assistance of a grief counselor to assist us in the working-through process.
In response to this suggestion, I would challenge current
psychological thinking on the best way to deal with our
emotions. I would, in particular, question the claim, made
by many psychological therapists, that people are not well
equipped to deal with grief on their own. I think people are
less brittle and more resilient, emotionally speaking, than therapists give them credit for.
To see why I say this, let us turn our attention back to the
Aberfan disaster. Parents whose children were buried alive in
the Aberfan landslide experienced a profound personal tragedy
but received no professional help thereafter. According to the
current psychological consensus, the lack of grief counseling
should have turned these parents into emotional wrecks. The
truth of the matter, though, is that they did remarkably well
dealing with their grief on their own.14 In other words, the
technique of keeping a stiff upper lip seems to have served
them admirably.
For another example of the consequences of dealing with
negative emotions on one’s own, consider the plight of the
British during World War II. When the war broke out, psychologists worried that mental hospitals would swell with civilians unable to cope with the horrors of war. As it turned out,
though, the Brits were quite capable of fending for themselves,
emotionally speaking: There was no change in the incidence

218 Stoicism for Modern Lives

of mental illness.15 In the absence of professional grief counselors, the Brits had little choice but to deal with their hardships
with Stoic resolve, and for them, Stoic self-therapy proved to
be remarkably successful.
It would be bad enough if grief counseling were simply ineffective. In some cases, though, such counseling seems to intensify and prolong people’s grief; in other words, it only makes
things worse. One study on the efﬁcacy of grief counseling
examined parents whose children had died of Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome. It compared the parents who consciously
tried to work through their loss, in accordance with the principles of grief therapy, with the parents who did not. Three
weeks after the death of their child, the parents in the ﬁrst
group were experiencing more distress than the parents in the
second group, and even after eighteen months the parents in
the ﬁrst group were worse off, emotionally speaking, than the
parents in the second group. The obvious conclusion to draw
from this research is that “forced grieving” in accordance with
the principles of grief therapy, rather than curing grief, can
delay the natural healing process; it is the psychological equivalent of picking at the scab on a wound. Similar research, by
the way, has focused on Holocaust survivors, abused young
women, and the partners of men who died of AIDS, and has
obtained similar results.16
But what about delayed grief ? If we cut short the grieving
process, aren’t we setting ourselves up for a much more debilitating bout of grief later on? The consensus among experts
is that the delayed grief phenomenon is genuine. 17 Am
I suggesting that they are wrong?

The Decline of Stoicism 219

Indeed I am. The concept of delayed grief apparently made
its debut in a paper titled “The Absence of Grief,” written
in 1937 by the psychiatrist Helene Deutsch. She claimed that
failing to grieve after a personal loss would subsequently
trigger a delayed bout of grief that would be “as fresh and
intense as if the loss just occurred.”18 Unfortunately, Deutsch
did not attempt to verify her theory empirically. Researchers
who subsequently have tried to verify it have been disappointed: Cases of delayed grief seem to be quite rare.19
More generally, the psychiatrist Sally Satel and the philosopher Christina Hoff Sommers, in a book that challenges certain
aspects of modern psychological therapy, write, “Recent ﬁndings suggest that reticence and suppression of feelings, far from
compromising one’s psychological well-being, can be healthy
and adaptive. For many temperaments, an excessive focus
on introspection and self-disclosure is depressing. Victims of
loss and tragedy differ widely in their reactions: Some beneﬁt
from therapeutic intervention; most do not and should not
be coerced by mental health professionals into emotionally
correct responses. Trauma and grief counselors have erred
massively in this direction.” These authors add that they reject
the doctrine, now commonly accepted, that “uninhibited
emotional openness is essential to mental health.”20
In conclusion, although the Stoics’ advice on how best to
deal with negative emotions is old-fashioned, it would nevertheless appear to be good advice. According to Seneca, “A man
is as wretched as he has convinced himself that he is.” He therefore recommends that we “do away with complaint about past
sufferings and with all language like this: ‘None has ever been

220 Stoicism for Modern Lives

worse off than I. What sufferings, what evils have I endured!’ ”
After all, what point is there in “being unhappy, just because
once you were unhappy?”21
Modern politics presents another obstacle to the acceptance of Stoicism. The world is full of politicians who tell us
that if we are unhappy it isn’t our fault. To the contrary, our
unhappiness is caused by something the government did to us
or is failing to do for us. We citizens are encouraged, in our
pursuit of happiness, to resort to politics rather than philosophy. We are encouraged to march in the streets or write to
our congressman rather than read Seneca or Epictetus. More
signiﬁcantly, we are encouraged to vote for the candidate who
claims to possess the ability, by skillfully using the powers of
government, to make us happy.
The Stoics, of course, rejected such thinking. They were
convinced that what stands between most of us and happiness is not our government or the society in which we live,
but defects in our philosophy of life—or our failing to have
a philosophy at all. It is true that our government and our
society determine, to a considerable extent, our external
circumstances, but the Stoics understood that there is at best a
loose connection between our external circumstances and how
happy we are. In particular, it is entirely possible for someone
banished to a desolate island to be happier than someone living
a life of luxury.
The Stoics understood that governments can wrong
their citizens; indeed, the Roman Stoics, as we have seen,
had an unfortunate tendency to be unjustly punished by the

The Decline of Stoicism 221

powers that be. The Stoics also agree with modern social
reformers that we have a duty to ﬁght against social injustice.
Where they differ from modern reformers is in their understanding of human psychology. In particular, the Stoics don’t
think it is helpful for people to consider themselves victims of
society—or victims of anything else, for that matter. If you
consider yourself a victim, you are not going to have a good
life; if, however, you refuse to think of yourself as a victim—if
you refuse to let your inner self be conquered by your external
circumstances—you are likely to have a good life, no matter
what turn your external circumstances take. (In particular, the
Stoics thought it possible for a person to retain his tranquility
despite being punished for attempting to reform the society in
which he lived.)
Others may have it in their power to affect how and even
whether you live, but they do not, say the Stoics, have it in
their power to ruin your life. Only you can ruin it, by failing to
live in accordance with the correct values.
The Stoics believed in social reform, but they also believed in
personal transformation. More precisely, they thought the ﬁrst
step in transforming a society into one in which people live a
good life is to teach people how to make their happiness depend
as little as possible on their external circumstances. The second
step in transforming a society is to change people’s external
circumstances. The Stoics would add that if we fail to transform ourselves, then no matter how much we transform the
society in which we live, we are unlikely to have a good life.
Many of us have been persuaded that happiness is something that someone else, a therapist or a politician, must confer

222 Stoicism for Modern Lives

on us. Stoicism rejects this notion. It teaches us that we are
very much responsible for our happiness as well as our unhappiness. It also teaches us that it is only when we assume responsibility for our happiness that we will have a reasonable chance
of gaining it. This, to be sure, is a message that many people,
having been indoctrinated by therapists and politicians, don’t
want to hear.
If modern psychology and politics have been unkind to
Stoicism, so has modern philosophy. Before the twentieth
century, those who were exposed to philosophy would likely
have read the Stoics. In the twentieth century, though, philosophers not only lost interest in Stoicism but lost interest, more
generally, in philosophies of life. It was possible, as my own
experience demonstrates, to spend a decade taking philosophy
classes without having read the Stoics and without having spent
time considering philosophies of life, much less adopting one.
One reason philosophers lost interest in Stoicism was their
insight, in the ﬁrst decades of the twentieth century, that many
traditional philosophical puzzles arise because of our sloppy
use of language. From this it followed that anyone wishing
to solve philosophical puzzles should do so not by observing
humanity (as the Stoics were likely to do) but by thinking very
carefully about language and how we use it. And along with the
increasing emphasis on linguistic analysis came a growing belief,
on the part of professional philosophers, that it simply was not
the business of philosophy to tell people how to live their life.
If you had gone to Epictetus and said, “I want to live a good
life. What should I do?” he would have had an answer for you:

The Decline of Stoicism 223

“Live in accordance with nature.” He would then have told
you, in great detail, how to do this. If, by way of contrast,
you went to a twentieth-century analytic philosopher and
asked the same question, he probably would have responded
not by answering the question you asked but by analyzing
the question itself: “The answer to your question depends
on what you mean by ‘a good life,’ which in turn depends on
what you mean by ‘good’ and ‘a life.’ ” He might then walk
you through all the things you could conceivably mean in
asking how to live a good life and explain why each of these
meanings is logically muddled. His conclusion: It makes no
sense to ask how to live a good life. When this philosopher
had ﬁnished speaking, you might be impressed with his ﬂair
for philosophical analysis, but you might also conclude, with
good reason, that he himself lacked a coherent philosophy
of life.
One final but quite signiﬁcant obstacle to modern acceptance
of Stoicism is the degree of self-control it requires. Do we
detect in ourselves a lust for fame? According to the Stoics, we
should extinguish this desire. Do we ﬁnd ourselves longing for
a mansion ﬁlled with ﬁne furniture? We would do well, say the
Stoics, to content ourselves with a simple lifestyle. And besides
overcoming our longing for fame and fortune, the Stoics want
us to set many of our other personal desires aside so we can do
our duty to serve our fellow humans. They were, as we have
seen, a duty-bound group; unlike many modern individuals,
the Stoics were convinced that there was something in life
bigger than themselves.

224 Stoicism for Modern Lives

Many people, on hearing about the self-control Stoicism
requires, will reject the philosophy. If you don’t have something you want, they reason, you will obviously be unhappy.
Therefore, the best way to gain happiness is to get what you
want, and the best way to get what you want is with a threestage strategy: First, you take an inventory of the desires that
lurk in your mind; second, you devise a plan for satisfying
those desires; and third, you implement that plan. The Stoics,
however, are suggesting that we do just the opposite of this.
In some cases, they advise us to extinguish rather than fulﬁll
our desires, and in other cases, they advise us to do things we
don’t want to do, because it is our duty to do them. Stoicism,
in other words, sounds like a sure-ﬁre recipe for unhappiness.
Although the strategy of gaining happiness by working to
get whatever it is we ﬁnd ourselves wanting is obvious and has
been used by most people throughout recorded history and
across cultures, it has an important defect, as thoughtful people
throughout recorded history and across cultures have realized:
For each desire we fulﬁll in accordance with this strategy, a
new desire will pop into our head to take its place. This means
that no matter how hard we work to satisfy our desires, we
will be no closer to satisfaction than if we had fulﬁlled none of
them. We will, in other words, remain dissatisﬁed.
A much better, albeit less obvious way to gain satisfaction is
not by working to satisfy our desires but by working to master
them. In particular, we need to take steps to slow down the
desire-formation process within us. Rather than working to
fulﬁll whatever desires we ﬁnd in our head, we need to work at
preventing certain desires from forming and eliminating many

The Decline of Stoicism 225

of the desires that have formed. And rather than wanting new
things, we need to work at wanting the things we already have.
This is what the Stoics advise us to do. It may be true that
being a Stoic requires self-control and requires that we sacriﬁce
in order to do our duty, but the Stoics would argue that we are
more likely to achieve happiness—indeed, joy—by following
this path than by spending our life, as most people do, working
to fulﬁll whatever desires pop into our head.
Having said this, I should add that the word sacrifice,
as I have just used it, is a bit misleading. The Stoics, while
doing their social duty, will not think in terms of sacriﬁce.
Ideally, they will, as a result of practicing Stoicism, want to
do what their social duty requires them to do. If this sounds
strange, think about the duties involved in parenting. Parents
do lots of things for their children, but Stoic parents—and,
I suspect, good parents in general—don’t think of parenting
as a burdensome task requiring endless sacriﬁce; instead, they
think about how wonderful it is that they have children and
can make a positive difference in the lives of these children.
The Stoics, as I have suggested, are not alone in claiming
that our best hope at gaining happiness is to live not a life of
self-indulgence but a life of self-discipline and, to a degree, selfsacriﬁce. Similar claims have been made in other philosophies,
including Epicureanism and Skepticism, as well as in numerous
religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam,
and Taoism. The question isn’t, I think, whether self-disciplined
and duty-bound people can have a happy, meaningful life; it is
whether those who lack self-control and who are convinced
that nothing is bigger than they are can have such a life.

Stoicism Reconsidered

In the previous chapter, I described the decline of Stoicism
and tried to fathom the reason for its current moribund state.
In this chapter, I will attempt to reanimate the doctrine. My
goal in doing so is to make Stoicism more attractive to individuals who seek a philosophy of life.
In the introduction to this book, I explained that philosophies of life have two components: They tell us what things
in life are and aren’t worth pursuing, and they tell us how
to gain the things that are worth having. The Stoics, as we
have seen, thought tranquility was worth pursuing, and the
tranquility they sought, it will be remembered, is a psychological state in which we experience few negative emotions,
such as anxiety, grief, and fear, but an abundance of positive emotions, especially joy. The Stoics did not argue that
tranquility was valuable; rather, they assumed that in the
lives of most people its value would at some point become
apparent.
To develop and reﬁne their strategy for attaining tranquility,
the Stoics became keen observers of humanity. They sought
to determine what sorts of things disrupt people’s tranquility,

Stoicism Reconsidered 227

how people can avoid having their tranquility disrupted by
these things, and how they can quickly restore their tranquility
when, despite their efforts, it is disrupted. On the basis of these
investigations, the Stoics produced a body of advice for anyone
seeking tranquility. Among their recommendations were the
following:
• We should become self-aware: We should observe ourselves
as we go about our daily business, and we should periodically reﬂect on how we responded to the day’s events. How
did we respond to an insult? To the loss of a possession?
To a stressful situation? Did we, in our responses, put Stoic
psychological strategies to work?
• We should use our reasoning ability to overcome negative emotions. We should also use our reasoning ability to
master our desires, to the extent that it is possible to do so. In
particular, we should use reason to convince ourselves that
things such as fame and fortune aren’t worth having—not, at
any rate, if what we seek is tranquility—and therefore aren’t
worth pursuing. Likewise, we should use our reasoning
ability to convince ourselves that even though certain activities are pleasurable, engaging in those activities will disrupt
our tranquility, and the tranquility lost will outweigh the
pleasure gained.
• If, despite not having pursued wealth, we ﬁnd ourselves
wealthy, we should enjoy our afﬂuence; it was the Cynics,
not the Stoics, who advocated asceticism. But although we
should enjoy wealth, we should not cling to it; indeed, even
as we enjoy it, we should contemplate its loss.

228 Stoicism for Modern Lives

• We are social creatures; we will be miserable if we try to
cut off contact with other people. Therefore, if what we
seek is tranquility, we should form and maintain relations
with others. In doing so, though, we should be careful about
whom we befriend. We should also, to the extent possible,
avoid people whose values are corrupt, for fear that their
values will contaminate ours.
• Other people are invariably annoying, though, so if we
maintain relations with them, they will periodically upset
our tranquility—if we let them. The Stoics spent a considerable amount of time devising techniques for taking the pain
out of our relationships with other people. In particular,
they came up with techniques for dealing with the insults of
others and preventing them from angering us.
• The Stoics pointed to two principal sources of human
unhappiness—our insatiability and our tendency to worry
about things beyond our control—and they developed
techniques for removing these sources of unhappiness from
our life.
• To conquer our insatiability, the Stoics advise us to engage in
negative visualization. We should contemplate the impermanence of all things. We should imagine ourselves losing the
things we most value, including possessions and loved ones.
We should also imagine the loss of our own life. If we do
this, we will come to appreciate the things we now have, and
because we appreciate them, we will be less likely to form
desires for other things. And besides simply imagining that
things could be worse than they are, we should sometimes
cause things to be worse than they would otherwise be; Seneca

Stoicism Reconsidered 229

advises us to “practice poverty,” and Musonius advises us
voluntarily to forgo opportunities for pleasure and comfort.
• To curb our tendency to worry about things beyond our
control, the Stoics advise us to perform a kind of triage with
respect to the elements of our life and sort them into those
we have no control over, those we have complete control
over, and those we have some but not complete control over.
Having done this, we should not bother about things over
which we have no control. Instead, we should spend some of
our time dealing with things over which we have complete
control, such as our goals and values, and spend most of our
time dealing with things over which we have some but not
complete control. If we do this, we will avoid experiencing
much needless anxiety.
• When we spend time dealing with things over which we
have some but not complete control, we should be careful to
internalize our goals. My goal in playing tennis, for example,
should be not to win the match but to play the best match
possible.
• We should be fatalistic with respect to the external world:
We should realize that what has happened to us in the past
and what is happening to us at this very moment are beyond
our control, so it is foolish to get upset about these things.
The Stoics could have given us a philosophy of life without
explaining why it is a good philosophy. They could, in other
words, have left adoption of their philosophy of life as a leap
of faith, the way Zen Buddhists do with theirs. But being
philosophers, they felt the need to prove that theirs was the

230 Stoicism for Modern Lives

“correct” philosophy of life and that rival philosophies were
somehow mistaken.
In their proof of Stoicism, the Stoics ﬁrst observe that Zeus
created us and in doing so made us different from the other
animals by giving us reason. Because he cares about us, Zeus
wanted to design us so that we would always be happy, but he
lacked the power to do so. Instead, he did for us what he could:
He gave us the means to make life not just endurable but enjoyable. More precisely, he designed for us a pattern of living that,
if followed, would enable us to ﬂourish. The Stoics used their
reasoning ability to discover this pattern of living. They then
designed a philosophy of life that, if followed, would enable us
to live in accordance with this pattern—in accordance, as they
put it, with nature—and thereby to ﬂourish. In conclusion, if
we live in accordance with Stoic principles, we will have the
best life it is possible for a human to have. QED.
Adherents of most religions will, of course, reject this proof
of Stoicism, inasmuch as they will reject the claim that it was
Zeus who created us. Nevertheless, they might be willing to
accept a slightly altered version of the proof, one that substitutes God for Zeus. They might thereby transform the Stoics’
proof into a proof that is compatible with their religion.
Consider, however, the predicament of modern Stoics
who deny the existence of both Zeus and God, and therefore
reject the claim that Zeus or God created man. Suppose these
individuals believe instead that man came to exist through a
process of evolution. In this case, man wouldn’t have been
created for any purpose, meaning that it is impossible for us
to discover the purpose of a human being so that we can, by

Stoicism Reconsidered 231

performing that purpose well, ﬂourish. These individuals can,
I think, resolve their predicament by abandoning the Stoic
justiﬁcation of Stoicism in favor of a justiﬁcation that makes
use of scientiﬁc discoveries that were unavailable to the Stoics.
Let me explain how this can be done.
If someone asked me why Stoicism works, I would not tell
a story about Zeus (or God). Instead, I would talk about
evolutionary theory, according to which we humans came
to exist as the result of an interesting series of biological
accidents. I would then start talking about evolutionary
psycholog y, according to which we humans, besides
gaining a certain anatomy and physiology through evolutionary processes, gained certain psychological traits, such
as a tendency to experience fear or anxiety under certain
circumstances and a tendency to experience pleasure under
other circumstances. I would explain that we evolved these
tendencies not so that we could have a good life but so
that we would be likely to survive and reproduce. I would
add that unlike Zeus (or God), evolutionary processes are
indifferent to whether we flourish; they are concerned
only that we survive and reproduce. Indeed, an individual
who is utterly miserable but manages, despite his misery,
to survive and reproduce will play a greater role in evolutionary processes than a joyful individual who chooses not
to reproduce.
I would, at this point, pause to make sure my listener understands how our evolutionary past contributes to our current
psychological makeup. Why, for example, do we experience

232 Stoicism for Modern Lives

pain? Not because the gods or God wanted us to experience
it or thought we could somehow beneﬁt from experiencing
it, but because our evolutionary ancestors for whom (thanks
to an evolutionary “experiment”) injuries were painful were
much more likely to avoid such injuries—and therefore much
more likely to survive and reproduce—than ancestors who
were incapable of experiencing pain. Those who could experience pain were therefore more effective at transmitting their
genes than those who couldn’t, and as a result we humans have
inherited the ability to experience pain.
It is also because of evolutionary processes that we possess
the ability to experience fear: Our evolutionary ancestors who
feared lions were less likely to be eaten by one than those who
were indifferent to them. Likewise, our tendency to experience anxiety and insatiability is a consequence of our evolutionary past. Our evolutionary ancestors who felt anxious
about whether they had enough food were less likely to starve
than those who didn’t worry about where their next meal was
coming from. Similarly, our evolutionary ancestors who were
never satisﬁed with what they had, who always wanted more
food or better shelter, were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who were easily satisﬁed.
Our ability to experience pleasure also has an evolutionary
explanation. Why, for example, does sex feel good? Because our
evolutionary ancestors who found sex to be pleasurable were
far more likely to reproduce than those who were indifferent
to sex or, even worse, found it to be unpleasant. We inherited
the genes of those ancestors for whom sex felt good, and as a
result we also ﬁnd it to be pleasurable.

Stoicism Reconsidered 233

The Stoics, as we have seen, thought Zeus designed us to
be gregarious. I agree with the Stoics that we are “by nature”
gregarious. I reject the claim, though, that Zeus (or God) made
us this way. Rather, we are gregarious because our evolutionary
ancestors who felt drawn to other people, and who therefore
joined groups of individuals, were more likely to survive and
reproduce than those who didn’t.
Besides being evolutionarily “programmed” to seek relationships with other people, I think we are programmed to
seek social status among them. Presumably, the groups our
evolutionary ancestors formed had social hierarchies within
them, the way troops of monkeys do. A group member who
had low status ran the risk of being deprived of resources
or even of being driven from the group, events that could
threaten his survival. Furthermore, the low-status males of a
group were unlikely to reproduce. Therefore, those ancestors
who felt motivated to seek social status—those ancestors for
whom gaining social status felt good and losing it felt bad—
were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who
were indifferent to social status. Thanks to our evolutionary
past, today’s humans ﬁnd it pleasant to gain social status and
unpleasant to lose it. This is why it is delightful when others
praise us and painful when they insult us.
According to the Stoics, Zeus gave us the ability to reason
so we could be godlike. I, however, think we gained the ability
to reason in the same way that we gained our other abilities:
through evolutionary processes. Our evolutionary ancestors
who had reasoning ability were more likely to survive and
reproduce than those who didn’t. It is also important to realize

234 Stoicism for Modern Lives

that we did not gain the ability to reason so that we could
transcend our evolutionarily programmed desires, such as our
desire for sex and social status. To the contrary, we gained the
ability to reason so that we could more effectively satisfy those
desires—so that we could, for example, devise complex strategies by which to satisfy our desire for sex and social status.
We have the abilities we do because possessing them enabled
our evolutionary ancestors to survive and reproduce. From
this it does not follow, though, that we must use these abilities to survive and reproduce. Indeed, thanks to our reasoning
ability, we have it in our power to “misuse” our evolutionary
inheritance. Allow me to explain.
Consider our ability to hear. We gained this ability through
evolutionary processes: Those ancestors who had the ability to
hear approaching predators had a better chance of surviving
and reproducing than those who didn’t. And yet modern
humans rarely use their hearing ability for this purpose. Instead
we might use it to listen to Beethoven, an activity that in no way
increases our chances of surviving and reproducing. Besides
misusing our ability to hear, we also misuse the ears that evolved
in conjunction with this ability; we might use them, for example,
to hold on eyeglasses or earrings. Likewise, we gained the ability
to walk because our ancestors who had this ability were more
likely to survive and reproduce than those who didn’t, and yet
some people use this ability to climb Mount Everest, an activity
that distinctly reduces their chances of surviving.
Just as we can “misuse” our ability to hear or walk—use
these abilities, that is, in a way that has nothing to do with

Stoicism Reconsidered 235

the survival and reproduction of our species—we can misuse
our ability to reason. In particular, we can use it to circumvent
the behavioral tendencies that have been programmed into us
by evolution. Thanks to our evolutionary past, for example,
we are rewarded for having sex. But thanks to our reasoning
ability, we can decide to forgo opportunities for sex because
taking advantage of these opportunities will lead us away from
various goals we have set for ourselves, goals that have nothing
to do with our surviving and reproducing. (Most dramatically,
we can decide to remain celibate, a decision that will reduce to
zero our chance of reproducing.) More important, we can use
our reasoning ability to conclude that many of the things that
our evolutionary programming encourages us to seek, such
as social status and more of anything we already have, may
be valuable if our goal is simply to survive and reproduce, but
aren’t at all valuable if our goal is instead to experience tranquility while we are alive.
The Stoics, as we have seen, thought that although Zeus
made us susceptible to suffering, he also gave us a tool—our
reasoning ability—that, if used properly, could prevent much
suffering. A parallel claim, I think, can be made about evolution: Evolutionary processes made us susceptible to suffering
but also gave us—accidentally—a tool by which we can prevent
much of this suffering. The tool, once again, is our reasoning
ability. Because we can reason, we can not only understand our
evolutionary predicament but take conscious steps to escape it,
to the extent possible.
Although our evolutionary programming helped us ﬂourish
as a species, it has in many respects outlived its usefulness.

236 Stoicism for Modern Lives

Consider, for example, the pain we might experience when
someone publicly insults us. I have given an evolutionary explanation for this pain: We experience it because our evolutionary
ancestors who cared deeply about gaining and retaining social
status were more likely to survive and reproduce than our
ancestors who were indifferent to social status and who, therefore, didn’t experience pain on being insulted. But the world has
changed dramatically since our ancestors roamed the savannas
of Africa. Today it is quite possible to survive despite having low
social status; even if others despise us, the law prevents them
from taking our food from us or driving us from our home.
Furthermore, low social status is no longer an impediment to
reproduction; indeed, in many parts of the world, men and
women with low social status have higher rates of reproduction than men and women with high social status.
If our goal is not merely to survive and reproduce but to
enjoy a tranquil existence, the pain associated with a loss of
social status isn’t just useless, it is counterproductive. As we go
about our daily affairs, other people, because of their evolutionary programming, will work, often unconsciously, to gain
social status. As a result, they will be inclined to snub us, insult
us, or, more generally, do things to put us in our place, socially
speaking. Their actions can have the effect of disrupting our
tranquility—if we let them. What we must do, in these cases,
is use—more precisely, “misuse”—our intellect to override the
evolutionary programming that makes insults painful to us.
We must, in other words, use our reasoning ability to remove
the emotional sting of insults and thereby make them less
disruptive to our tranquility.

Stoicism Reconsidered 237

Along similar lines, consider our insatiability. As we have
seen, our evolutionary ancestors beneﬁted from wanting more
of everything, which is why we today have this tendency. But
our insatiability, if we do not take steps to bridle it, will disrupt
our tranquility; instead of enjoying what we already have, we
will spend our life working hard to gain things we don’t have,
in the sadly mistaken belief that once we have them, we will
enjoy them and search no further. What we must do, again,
is misuse our intellect. Instead of using it to devise clever strategies to get more of everything, we must use it to overcome our
tendency toward insatiability. And one excellent way for us to do
this is to use our intellect to engage in negative visualization.
Consider, ﬁnally, anxiety. We are evolutionarily programmed,
as we have seen, to be worriers: Our evolutionary ancestors
who, instead of worrying about where their next meal was
coming from and about the source of that growling noise in
the trees, sat around blissfully enjoying the sunset probably
didn’t live to a ripe old age. But most modern individuals—in
developed countries, at any rate—live in a remarkably safe and
predictable environment; there are no growling noises in the
trees, and we can be reasonably certain that our next meal is
forthcoming. There is simply much less for us to worry about.
Nevertheless, we retain our ancestors’ tendency to worry.
What we must do, if we wish to gain tranquility, is “misuse”
our intellect to overcome this tendency. In particular, we can, in
accordance with Stoic advice, determine which are the things
we cannot control. We can then use our reasoning ability to
eradicate our anxieties with respect to these things. Doing this
will improve our chances of gaining tranquility.

238 Stoicism for Modern Lives

Allow me to recapitulate. The Stoics thought they could
prove that Stoicism was the one correct philosophy of life, and
in their proof, they assumed that Zeus exists and created us for
a certain purpose. I think it is possible, though, for someone to
reject the Stoic proof of Stoicism without rejecting Stoicism
itself. In particular, someone who thinks that the Stoics were
mistaken in their assertion that we were created for a purpose
might nevertheless think that the Stoics, in their philosophy
of life, chose the correct goal (tranquility) and discovered a
number of useful techniques for attaining this goal.
Thus, if someone asked me, “Why should I practice
Stoicism?” my answer would not invoke the name of Zeus (or
God) and would not talk about the function that humans were
designed to fulﬁll. Instead, I would talk about our evolutionary
past; about how, because of this past, we are evolutionarily
programmed to want certain things and to experience certain
emotions under certain circumstances; about how living in
accordance with our evolutionary programming, although it
may have allowed our evolutionary ancestors to survive and
reproduce, can result in modern humans living miserable
lives; and about how, by “misusing” our reasoning ability, we
can overcome our evolutionary programming. I would go on
to point out that the Stoics, although they didn’t understand
evolution, nevertheless discovered psychological techniques
that, if practiced, can help us overcome those aspects of our
evolutionary programming that might otherwise disrupt our
tranquility.
Stoicism, understood properly, is a cure for a disease. The
disease in question is the anxiety, grief, fear, and various other

Stoicism Reconsidered 239

negative emotions that plague humans and prevent them from
experiencing a joyful existence. By practicing Stoic techniques,
we can cure the disease and thereby gain tranquility. What I am
suggesting is that although the ancient Stoics found a “cure”
for negative emotions, they were mistaken about why the cure
works.
To better understand the point I am making, consider
aspirin. That aspirin works is indisputable; people have known
this and used it as a medicine for thousands of years. The question is, how and why does it work?
Ancient Egyptians, who made medicinal use of willow bark,
which contains the same active ingredient as aspirin does, had
a theory. They thought four elements ﬂow in us: blood, air,
water, and a substance called wekhudu. They theorized that an
overabundance of wekhudu caused pain and inﬂammation and
that chewing on willow bark or drinking willow tea reduced
the amount of wekhudu in someone experiencing pain or
inﬂammation and thereby restored his health.1 This theory, of
course, was wrong: There is no such thing as wekhudu. What
is signiﬁcant is that even though their theory about how aspirin
works was mistaken, aspirin nevertheless worked for them.
In the early centuries of the ﬁrst millennium, the use of
willow bark as a medicine was widespread, but then Europeans
appear to have forgotten about its medicinal power. It was
rediscovered in the eighteenth century by an Englishman, the
Reverend Edward Stone. He knew that willow bark was an
effective analgesic and antipyretic, but was as much in the dark
about how it worked as the ancient Egyptians were. In the

240 Stoicism for Modern Lives

nineteenth century, chemists determined that the active ingredient in willow bark is salicylic acid but remained ignorant of
how and why salicylic acid works. Indeed, it wasn’t until the
1970s that researchers ﬁnally ﬁgured out how aspirin works:
Damaged cells produce arachidonic acid, which triggers the
creation of prostaglandins, which in turn cause fever, inﬂammation, and pain. By preventing the formation of prostaglandins, aspirin short-circuits this process.2
The thing to realize is that people’s ignorance about how
and why aspirin works did not stop it from working. I would
like to make a parallel claim about Stoicism. The Stoics
were like the ancient Egyptians who stumbled across a cure
for a common ailment and exploited it without knowing
why it works. Whereas the Egyptians stumbled across a
cure for headaches and fever, the Stoics stumbled across
a cure for negative emotions; more precisely, they developed
a group of psychological techniques that, if practiced, could
promote tranquility. Both the Egyptians and the Stoics were
mistaken about why their cure works but not about its
efficacy.
The early Stoics, it will be remembered, had an active
interest in science. The problem is that their science was primitive and could not answer many of the questions they asked.
As a result, they resorted to a priori explanations for the efﬁcacy of Stoicism and the techniques it provides—explanations
based not on observations of the world but on philosophical
ﬁrst principles. Would they, one wonders, have offered different
explanations if they had known about evolution and, more
important, evolutionary psychology?

Stoicism Reconsidered 241

Someone might, at this point, take the aspirin analogy one
step further and turn it against Stoicism. In the same way that
we have a better understanding of science than the Stoics did,
we have (in part, because of this improved understanding)
medicines that they lacked. In particular, we have tranquilizers
such as Xanax that can relieve feelings of anxiety that would
otherwise be an obstacle to our tranquility. This suggests the
existence of a “royal road” to the tranquility the Stoics sought:
Rather than going to our bookstore to buy a copy of Seneca,
we should go to our doctor for a Xanax prescription. According
to this line of thinking, the Stoic strategy for attaining tranquility can best be described as old-fashioned. Stoicism might
have made sense for people who lived two thousand years ago;
medical science was in its infancy, and Xanax didn’t exist. But
for someone today to resort to Stoicism to deal with anxiety is
like someone going to a witch doctor to deal with an ulcer.
In response to this suggestion, let me point out that even
though it is true that taking Xanax can alleviate our anxieties,
there are nevertheless reasons to reject Xanax in favor of
Stoicism. To better understand this point, let us turn our attention to a related debate. Given the state of modern medicine,
an obese person has two alternatives available to him. He can
change his lifestyle: In particular, he can eat less and differently
and exercise more. Or he can resort to science to deal with his
obesity: He can take a weight-loss drug or undergo, say, gastric
bypass surgery.
Almost all doctors would recommend the ﬁrst alternative,
an old-fashioned change of lifestyle, even though modern,
high-tech alternatives exist. Only if a lifestyle change fails to

242 Stoicism for Modern Lives

reduce the obese person’s weight would these doctors recommend medication or surgery. In defense of this recommendation, doctors would point out that surgery is dangerous and
that weight-loss medications can have serious side effects.
Exercise, done properly, not only isn’t dangerous but promotes
our health. Furthermore, the beneﬁts of exercise will probably
spill over into other areas of our life. We are likely, for example,
to ﬁnd that we have more energy than we used to. Our selfesteem is also likely to rise.
Much the same can be said of resorting to Stoicism to
prevent and deal with feelings of anxiety. It is safer than the
medical alternatives, as any number of Xanax addicts will
attest. Furthermore, Stoicism has beneﬁts that spill over into
other areas of our life. Practicing Stoicism might not cause us
to gain energy, the way exercising will, but practicing it will
cause us to gain self-conﬁdence; we will become conﬁdent, in
particular, of our ability to handle whatever life throws our
way. The person who takes Xanax, in contrast, will gain no
such conﬁdence; indeed, he knows full well what a mess he
would be if his supply of Xanax was cut off. Another beneﬁt of
practicing Stoicism is that it will help us appreciate our life and
circumstances and may, as a consequence, enable us to experience joy. This is a beneﬁt, one supposes, that taking Xanax is
unlikely to deliver.
Not everyone, I realize, will be happy with my “modernization” of Stoicism. My fellow philosophers, for example, might
complain that in moving from a philosophical justiﬁcation of
Stoicism to a scientiﬁc justiﬁcation, I have, in essence, ripped

Stoicism Reconsidered 243

the head (advice and psychological techniques) off Stoicism and
grafted it onto the body (justiﬁcation) of an entirely different
animal. They might add that the resulting doctrine is not an
elegant chimera but a ghastly and unnatural monster—indeed,
a Frankenstein.
My fellow philosophers might go on to complain that my
scientiﬁc justiﬁcation of Stoicism is distinctly anti-Stoical. The
Stoics, as we have seen, advise us to live in accordance with
nature. I am suggesting, though, that we use our reasoning
ability to override our evolutionary programming—and therefore live, in a sense, in discordance with nature!
Stoic purists might also complain that in my treatment of
Stoicism I have ignored differences in opinion among the Stoics
I quote. Marcus, for example, seems to have been more dutybound than the other Stoics. And Musonius and Seneca, while
agreeing that Stoics needn’t be ascetics—that their philosophy
should not prevent them from enjoying life—disagreed on just
how heartily Stoics should enjoy it. Some will complain about the
way I have swept these and other disagreements under the rug.
In response to such criticisms, let me say this. What I have
done in the preceding pages is play the role of philosophical
detective: I have tried to determine what modern individuals
must do if they wish to adopt the philosophy of life advocated
by the Roman Stoics. What I discovered is that these Stoics did
not provide us with a handbook on how to become a Stoic;
indeed, not even Epictetus’s Handbook is such a handbook.
(Or if they did write treatises on how to practice Stoicism,
these treatises have subsequently been lost.)3 And it is understandable that they wouldn’t provide a handbook: In their time,

244 Stoicism for Modern Lives

those wishing to learn how to practice Stoicism didn’t need to
learn it from a book; they could instead attend a Stoic school.
As a result, I had to cobble together a brand of Stoicism from
clues scattered throughout the writings of the Roman Stoics.
The resulting version of Stoicism, although derived from the
ancient Stoics, is therefore unlike the Stoicism advocated by
any particular Stoic. It is also likely that the version of Stoicism
I have developed is in various respects unlike the Stoicism one
would have been taught to practice in an ancient Stoic school.
What I have attempted to do is develop a brand of Stoicism
that is useful to myself and, possibly, to those around me, and to
accomplish this goal I have tailored the philosophy to our circumstances. If someone told me that she sought tranquility, I would
advise her to try the Stoic psychological techniques described in
this book. I would also encourage her to explore the writings of
the ancient Stoics. I would warn her, though, that on doing this,
she would discover differences between my version of Stoicism
and the version favored by, say, Epictetus. I would add that if
she found Epictetus’s version more suited to her needs than my
version is, she should by all means choose his version.
I am not, to be sure, the ﬁrst Stoic to tamper with Stoicism.
The Romans, as we have seen, adapted Greek Stoicism to suit
their needs. Furthermore, individual Stoics were unafraid to
“customize” Stoicism; as Seneca put it, “I do not bind myself to
some particular one of the Stoic masters; I, too, have the right
to form an opinion.”4 The Stoics regarded the principles of
Stoicism not as being chiseled into stone but as being molded
into clay that could, within limits, be remolded into a form of
Stoicism that people would ﬁnd useful.

Stoicism Reconsidered 245

I have presented Stoicism as I think the Stoics intended it to
be used. They did not invent Stoicism for the amusement of
future philosophers. To the contrary, they can best be understood as toolmakers, and Stoicism is the tool they invented.
It is a tool that, if used properly, they thought would enable
a person to live a good life. I came across this tool, dusty and
disused, lying on a library shelf. I have taken it up, dusted it off,
replaced a few parts, and put it to work to see if it can still do
the job the Stoics designed it to do. I have discovered, to my
surprise and delight, that it can. In fact, I have discovered that
despite all the similar tools that have been invented since this
one fell into disuse, it does the job better than they do.
Nonphilosophers—the people, as I have explained, who are
the primary audience for this book—won’t be concerned with
preserving the purity of Stoicism. For them the question is,
Does it work? And even if Stoicism can in some sense be said
to work, they will go on to ask whether there is an alternative philosophy of life that works better still—whether, that
is, there is an alternative philosophy that delivers the same
(or greater) beneﬁts at a lower cost. If Stoicism doesn’t work
better than the alternatives, a thoughtful individual will refuse
to adopt it as his philosophy of life and will instead favor, say,
Epicureanism or Zen Buddhism.
Even though I have adopted Stoicism as my philosophy of
life, I do not claim that it is the only philosophy that “works”
or even that, for every person, in all circumstances, it works
better than alternative philosophies of life. All I am claiming
is that for some people in some circumstances—I seem to be

246 Stoicism for Modern Lives

one of those people—Stoicism is a wonderfully effective way
to gain tranquility.
Who, then, should give Stoicism a try? Someone who, to begin
with, seeks tranquility; it is, after all, the thing Stoicism promises to deliver. Someone who thinks something is more valuable
than tranquility would therefore be foolish to practice Stoicism.
Having the attainment of tranquility as a goal in living
will eliminate some potential philosophies of life. It will, for
example, eliminate hedonism, which has as its goal not tranquility but maximization of pleasure. But even after we settle
on tranquility as a primary goal of our philosophy of life, we
will have to choose among the philosophies of life that share
this goal; we will have to choose, for starters, among Stoicism,
Epicureanism, Skepticism, and Zen Buddhism. Which of these
philosophies of life is best for us? Which will best enable us to
gain the tranquility we seek? It depends, I think, on our personality and circumstances: What works for one person might
not work for another whose personality and circumstances
are different. When it comes to philosophies of life, in other
words, there is no one size that ﬁts all.
There are people, I think, whose personality is uniquely
well-suited to Stoicism. Even if no one formally introduces
these individuals to Stoicism, they will ﬁgure it out on their
own. These “congenital Stoics” are perpetually optimistic,
and they are appreciative of the world they ﬁnd themselves in.
If they were to pick up Seneca and start reading, they would
instantly recognize him as a kindred spirit.
There are other people who, because of their personality,
would ﬁnd it psychologically challenging to practice Stoicism.

Stoicism Reconsidered 247

These individuals simply refuse to consider the possibility that
they are the source of their own discontent. They spend their
days waiting, often impatiently, for the one thing to happen that
will make them feel good about themselves and their lives. The
missing ingredient, they are convinced, is something external to
them: It is something that someone must hand to them or do
for them. The thing in question might be a certain job, a certain
sum of money, or a certain form of cosmetic surgery. They are
also convinced that when this missing ingredient is provided,
their dissatisfaction with life will be remedied and they will
live happily ever after. If you suggest to one of these chronic
malcontents that she try Stoicism, she will likely dig in her heels
and refuse the suggestion: “It can’t work!” Such cases are tragic;
the innate pessimism of these individuals prevents them from
taking steps to overcome their pessimism and thereby dramatically reduces their chances of experiencing joy.
Most people have personalities that fall somewhere between
these two extremes. They are not congenital Stoics, nor are
they chronic malcontents. But although they might beneﬁt
from the practice of Stoicism, many of the individuals in this
group see no need to give it—or, for that matter, any other
philosophy of life—a try. They instead spend their days on
evolutionary autopilot: They go around seeking the rewards
their evolutionary programming has to offer, such as the pleasure to be derived from having sex or consuming a big meal,
and avoiding the punishments their programming can inﬂict,
such as the pain of being publicly insulted.
The day might come, though, when something happens
to take them off autopilot. It might be a personal tragedy or

248 Stoicism for Modern Lives

maybe a ﬂash of insight. At ﬁrst, they will be rather disoriented. They might then set out in search of a philosophy of
life. The ﬁrst step in such a search, I would maintain, is to
assess their personality and circumstances. Thereafter, their
goal should not be to ﬁnd the one, true philosophy of life but
to ﬁnd the philosophy that best suits them.
As I explained in the introduction to this book, there was a time
when I was attracted to Zen Buddhism as a philosophy of life,
but the more I learned about Zen, the less attractive it became.
In particular, I came to realize that Zen is incompatible with my
personality. I am a relentlessly analytical person. For Zen to work
for me, I would have to abandon my analytical nature. Stoicism,
though, expects me to put my analytical nature to work. As a
result, for me the cost of practicing Stoicism is considerably less
than the cost of practicing Zen. I would probably be miserable
trying to solve koans or trying to sit for hours with an empty
mind, but for other people, this won’t be the case.
The previous comments make it sound as if I am a relativist
with respect to philosophies of life, as if I take them all to be
equally valid. Rest assured that this is not the case. Although
I will not try to talk anyone into thinking that tranquility is
the thing to be most valued in life, I will try to talk people out
of certain other life goals. If, for example, you tell me that in
your philosophy of life your primary goal is to experience pain,
I will not take your philosophy to be as valid as Zen Buddhism
or Stoicism; I will instead take you to be quite misguided. Why,
I will ask, do you seek pain?

Stoicism Reconsidered 249

Suppose, on the other hand, that you tell me your goal in
living is the same as that of the Zen Buddhists and Stoics—
namely, the attainment of tranquility—but that you have a
different strategy for attaining this goal than they do: You are
convinced that the best way to attain it is to get your name
mentioned in People magazine. In this case, I will praise
the insight you have demonstrated in your choice of a goal,
but I will express serious reservations about your strategy
for attaining this goal. Do you honestly think that getting
mentioned in People will induce a state of tranquility? And if
so, how long will it last?
In summary, my advice to those seeking a philosophy of
life parallels my advice to those seeking a mate. They should
realize that which mate is best for them depends on their
personality and circumstances. This means that no one is the
ideal mate for everyone and that some people are a suitable
mate for no one at all. Furthermore, they should realize that
for the vast majority of people, life with a less than perfect
mate is better than life with no mate at all.
In much the same way, there is no one philosophy of life
that is ideal for everyone, and there are some philosophies of
life that no one should adopt. Furthermore, in almost all cases,
a person is better off to adopt a less than ideal philosophy of
life than to try to live with no philosophy at all. Indeed, if this
book converts not a single soul to Stoicism but encourages
people to think actively about their philosophy of life, I will
feel that I have, in accordance with Stoic principles, done a
service for my fellow humans.

Practicing Stoicism

I will end this book by sharing some of the insights I have
gained in my practice of Stoicism. In particular, I will offer
advice on how individuals wishing to try Stoicism as their
philosophy of life can derive the maximum benefit from
the trial with the minimum effort and frustration. I will also
describe some of the surprises, as well as some of the delights,
that lie in store for would-be Stoics.
The ﬁrst tip I would offer to those wishing to give Stoicism
a try is to practice what I have referred to as stealth Stoicism:
You would do well, I think, to keep it a secret that you are
a practicing Stoic. (This would have been my own strategy,
had I not taken it upon myself to become a teacher of
Stoicism.) By practicing Stoicism stealthily, you can gain its
beneﬁts while avoiding one signiﬁcant cost: the teasing and
outright mockery of your friends, relatives, neighbors, and
coworkers.
It is, I should add, quite easy to practice Stoicism on the
sly: You can, for example, engage in negative visualization
without anyone being the wiser. If your practice of Stoicism is
successful, friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers might

Practicing Stoicism 251

notice a difference in you—a change for the better—but they
will probably be hard-pressed to explain the transformation. If
they come to you, perplexed, and ask what your secret is, you
might choose to reveal the sordid truth to them: that you are
a closet Stoic.
My next piece of advice for would-be Stoics is not to try
to master all the Stoic techniques at once but to start with
one technique and, having become proﬁcient in it, go on to
another. And a good technique to start with, I think, is negative
visualization. At spare moments in the day, make it a point to
contemplate the loss of whatever you value in life. Engaging
in such contemplation can produce a dramatic transformation
in your outlook on life. It can make you realize, if only for a
time, how lucky you are—how much you have to be thankful
for, almost regardless of your circumstances.
It is my experience that negative visualization is to daily
living as salt is to cooking. Although it requires minimal time,
energy, and talent for a cook to add salt to food, the taste of
almost any food he adds it to will be enhanced as a result. In
much the same way, although practicing negative visualization
requires minimal time, energy, and talent, those who practice it will ﬁnd that their capacity to enjoy life is signiﬁcantly
enhanced. You might ﬁnd yourself, after engaging in negative
visualization, embracing the very life that, a short time before,
you had complained wasn’t worth living.
One thing I have discovered, though, in my practice of
Stoicism is that it is easy to forget to engage in negative visualization and as a result to go for days or even weeks without having

252 Stoicism for Modern Lives

visualized. I think I know why this happens. By engaging in
negative visualization, we increase our satisfaction with our
circumstances, but on gaining this sense of satisfaction, the
natural thing to do is simply enjoy life. Indeed, it is decidedly
unnatural for someone who is satisﬁed with life to spend time
thinking about the bad things that can happen. The Stoics,
however, would remind us that negative visualization, besides
making us appreciate what we have, can help us avoid clinging
to the things we appreciate. Consequently, it is as important to
engage in negative visualization when times are good as it is
when times are bad.
I tried making it my practice to engage in negative visualization each night at bedtime, as part of the “bedtime meditation” described back in chapter 8, but the experiment failed.
My problem is that I tend to fall asleep remarkably fast after
my head hits the pillow; there simply isn’t time to visualize.
I have instead made it my practice to engage in negative visualization (and more generally to assess my progress as a Stoic)
while driving to work. By doing this, I transform idle time into
time well spent.
After mastering negative visualization, a novice Stoic should
move on to become proﬁcient in applying the trichotomy of
control, described in chapter 5. According to the Stoics, we
should perform a kind of triage in which we distinguish between
things we have no control over, things we have complete control
over, and things we have some but not complete control over;
and having made this distinction, we should focus our attention
on the last two categories. In particular, we waste our time and

Practicing Stoicism 253

cause ourselves needless anxiety if we concern ourselves with
things over which we have no control.
I have discovered, by the way, that applying the trichotomy
of control, besides helping me manage my own anxieties, is an
effective technique for allaying the anxieties of the non-Stoics
around me, which anxieties might otherwise disrupt my tranquility. When relatives and friends share with me the sources
of anxiety in their lives, it often turns out that the things they
are worried about are beyond their control. My response to
such cases is to point this out to them: “What can you do about
this situation? Nothing! Then why are you worrying about it?
It is out of your hands, so it is pointless to worry.” (And if
I am in the mood, I follow this last comment with a quotation from Marcus Aurelius: “Nothing is worth doing pointlessly.”) It is interesting that even though some of the people I
have tried this on can charitably be described as anxiety-prone,
they almost always respond to the logic of the trichotomy of
control: Their anxiety is dispelled, if only for a time.
As a Stoic novice, you will want, as part of becoming proﬁcient in applying the trichotomy of control, to practice internalizing your goals. Instead of having winning a tennis match
as your goal, for example, make it your goal to prepare for the
match as best you can and to try your hardest in the match.
By routinely internalizing your goals, you can reduce (but
probably not eliminate) what would otherwise be a signiﬁcant
source of distress in your life: the feeling that you have failed
to accomplish some goal.
In your practice of Stoicism, you will also want, in conjunction with applying the trichotomy of control, to become a

254 Stoicism for Modern Lives

psychological fatalist about the past and the present—but not
about the future. Although you will be willing to think about
the past and present in order to learn things that can help you
better deal with the obstacles to tranquility thrown your way
in the future, you will refuse to spend time engaging in “if
only” thoughts about the past and present. You will realize
that inasmuch as the past and present cannot be changed, it
is pointless to wish they could be different. You will do your
best to accept the past, whatever it might have been, and to
embrace the present, whatever it might be.
Other people, as we have seen, are the enemy in our battle
for tranquility. It was for this reason that the Stoics spent
time developing strategies for dealing with this enemy and,
in particular, strategies for dealing with the insults of those
with whom we associate. One of the most interesting developments in my practice of Stoicism has been my transformation
from someone who dreaded insults into an insult connoisseur.
For one thing, I have become a collector of insults: On being
insulted, I analyze and categorize the insult. For another thing,
I look forward to being insulted inasmuch as it affords me the
opportunity to perfect my “insult game.” I know this sounds
strange, but one consequence of the practice of Stoicism is
that one seeks opportunities to put Stoic techniques to work.
I will have more to say about this phenomenon below.
One of the things that makes insults difﬁcult to deal with
is that they generally come as surprises. You are calmly chatting with someone when—wham!—he says something that,
although it might not have been intended as an insult, can

Practicing Stoicism 255

easily be construed as one. Recently, for example, I was talking
to a colleague about a book he was writing. He said that in this
book, he was going to comment on some political material
I had published. I was delighted that he was aware of my work
and was going to mention it, but then came the put-down:
“I’m trying to decide,” he said, “whether, in my response to
what you have written, I should characterize you as evil or
merely misguided.”
Realize that such comments are to be expected from
academics. We are a pathetically contentious lot. We want
others not only to be aware of our work but to admire it and,
better still, to defer to the conclusions we have drawn. The
problem is that our colleagues seek the same admiration and
deference from us. Something has to give, and as a result, on
campuses everywhere, academics routinely engage in verbal
ﬁsticuffs. Put-downs are commonplace, and insults ﬂy.
In my pre-Stoic days, I would have felt the sting of this
insult and probably would have gotten angry. I would have
vigorously defended my work and would have done my best
to unleash a counterinsult. But on that particular day, having
fallen under the inﬂuence of the Stoics, I had the presence of
mind to respond to this insult in a Stoically acceptable manner,
with self-deprecating humor: “Why can’t you portray me as
being both evil and misguided?” I asked.
Self-deprecating humor has become my standard response
to insults. When someone criticizes me, I reply that matters
are even worse than he is suggesting. If, for example, someone
suggests that I am lazy, I reply that it is a miracle that I get any
work done at all. If someone accuses me of having a big ego,

256 Stoicism for Modern Lives

I reply that on most days it is noon before I become aware
that anyone else inhabits the planet. Such responses may seem
counterproductive since in offering them, I am in a sense validating the insulter’s criticisms of me. But by offering such
responses, I make it clear to the insulter that I have enough
conﬁdence in who I am to be impervious to his insults; for
me, they are a laughing matter. Furthermore, by refusing to
play the insult game—by refusing to respond to an insult with
a counterinsult—I make it clear that I regard myself as being
above such behavior. My refusal to play the insult game will
likely irritate the insulter more than a counterinsult would.
One of the worst things we can do when other people
annoy us is get angry. The anger will, after all, be a major
obstacle to our tranquility. The Stoics realized that anger is
anti-joy and that it can ruin our life if we let it. In the course of
observing my emotions, I have paid careful attention to anger
and as a result have discovered a few things about it.
To begin with, I have become fully aware of the extent to
which anger has a life of its own within me. It can lie dormant,
like a virus, only to revive and make me miserable when I least
expect it. I might, for example, be in yoga class trying to empty
my head of thoughts, when out of nowhere I ﬁnd myself ﬁlled
with anger about some incident that took place years before.
Furthermore, I have drawn the conclusion that Seneca was
mistaken in suggesting that there is no pleasure in expressing
anger.1 This is the problem with anger: It feels good to vent it
and feels bad to suppress it. Indeed, when our anger is righteous anger—when we are conﬁdent that we are right and

Practicing Stoicism 257

whomever we are angry at is wrong—it feels quite wonderful
to vent it and let the person who wronged us know of our
anger. Anger, in other words, resembles a mosquito bite:
It feels bad not to scratch a bite and feels good to scratch it.
The problem with mosquito bites, of course, is that after you
scratch one, you typically wish you hadn’t done so: The itch
returns, intensiﬁed, and by scratching the bite, you increase
the chance that it will become infected. Much the same can be
said of anger: Although it feels good to vent it, you will probably subsequently regret having done so.
It is one thing to vent anger (or better still, feign anger) with
the goal of modifying someone’s behavior: People do respond
to anger. What I have discovered, though, is that a signiﬁcant
portion of the anger I vent can’t be explained in these terms.
When I am driving my car, for example, I periodically get
angry—righteously, I think—at other drivers who drive incompetently, and sometimes I even yell at them. Since my windows
and theirs are rolled up, the other drivers can’t hear me and
therefore can’t respond to my anger by not doing again in the
future whatever it was that made me mad. This anger, although
righteous, is utterly pointless. By venting it, I accomplish nothing
other than to disturb my own tranquility.
In other cases, although I am (righteously) angry at
someone, I cannot, because of my circumstances, express my
anger directly to him, so instead I ﬁnd myself having black
thoughts about him. Again, these feelings of anger are pointless: They disturb me but have no impact at all on the person at
whom I am angry. Indeed, if anything, they serve to compound
the harm he does me. What a waste!

258 Stoicism for Modern Lives

I have found, by the way, that practicing Stoicism has helped
me reduce the frequency with which I get angry at other
drivers: I yell perhaps a tenth as often as I used to. It has also
helped me reduce the number of black thoughts I have about
people who wronged me long ago. And when black thoughts
do infect me, they don’t last as long as they used to.
Because anger has these characteristics—because it can lie
dormant within us and because venting it feels good—our
anger will be difﬁcult to overcome, and learning to overcome
it is one of the biggest challenges a Stoic practitioner faces. But
one thing I have found is that the more you think about and
understand anger, the easier it is to control it. As it so happens,
I read Seneca’s essay on anger while waiting at a doctor’s ofﬁce.
The doctor was woefully behind schedule, and as a result I was
left sitting in the waiting room for nearly an hour. I had every
right to be angry, and in my pre-Stoic days I almost certainly
would have been angry. But because I was thinking about
anger during that hour, I found it impossible to get angry.
I have also found that it is quite useful to use humor as
a defense against anger. In particular, I have found that one
wonderful way to avoid getting angry is to imagine myself as a
character in an absurdist play: Things aren’t supposed to make
sense, people aren’t supposed to be competent, and justice,
when it happens at all, happens by accident. Instead of letting
myself be angered by events, I persuade myself to laugh at
them. Indeed, I try to think of ways the imaginary absurdist
playwright could have made things still more absurd.
Seneca, I am certain, was right when he pointed to laughter
as the proper response to “the things which drive us to tears.”2

Practicing Stoicism 259

Seneca also observes that “he shows a greater mind who does
not restrain his laughter than he who does not restrain his
tears, since the laughter gives expression to the mildest of the
emotions, and deems that there is nothing important, nothing
serious, nor wretched either, in the whole outﬁt of life.”3
Besides advising us to imagine bad things happening to us,
the Stoics, as we have seen, advise us to cause bad things to
happen as the result of our undertaking a program of voluntary discomfort. Seneca, for example, advises us periodically to
live as if we were poor, and Musonius advises us to do things
to cause ourselves discomfort. Following this advice requires a
greater degree of self-discipline than practicing the other Stoic
techniques does. Programs of voluntary discomfort are therefore best left to “advanced Stoics.”
I have experimented with a program of voluntary discomfort. I have not attempted to go barefoot, as Musonius
suggested, but I have tried less radical behavior, such as underdressing for winter weather, not heating my car in the winter,
and not air conditioning it in the summer.
I have also started taking yoga classes. Yoga has improved
my balance and ﬂexibility, reminded me of the importance of
play, and made me acutely aware of how little control I have
over the contents of my mind. But besides conferring these
and other beneﬁts on me, yoga has been a wonderful source
of voluntary discomfort. While doing yoga, I twist myself into
poses that are uncomfortable or that in some cases border on
being painful. I will, for example, bend my legs until they are
at the very edge of a cramp and then back off a bit. My yoga

260 Stoicism for Modern Lives

teacher, though, never talks about pain; instead, she talks about
poses giving rise to “too much sensation.” She has taught me
how to “breathe into” the place that hurts, which of course is
physiologically impossible if what I am experiencing is, say, a
leg cramp. And yet, the technique undeniably works.
Another source of discomfort—and admittedly, of entertainment and delight as well—is rowing. Shortly after I began
practicing Stoicism, I learned to row a racing shell and have
since started racing competitively. We rowers are exposed
to heat and humidity in the summer and to cold, wind, and
sometimes even snow in the spring and fall. We are periodically splashed, unceremoniously, with water. We develop blisters and then calluses. (Whittling down calluses is a favorite
off-water activity of serious rowers.)
Besides being a source of physical discomfort, rowing is
a wonderful source of emotional discomfort. In particular,
rowing has provided me with a list of fears to overcome.
The racing shells I row are quite unstable; indeed, given half
a chance, they will gleefully dump a rower into the water. It
took me considerable effort to overcome my fear of ﬂipping
(by successfully surviving three ﬂips). From there, I went on
to work through other fears, including a fear of rowing in the
predawn darkness, a fear of pushing off from the dock while
standing up in the boat, and a fear of being out in the middle
of a lake, hundreds of yards from the nearest shore, in a tiny
boat (that has thrice betrayed me).
Whenever you undertake an activity in which public failure
is a possibility, you are likely to experience butterﬂies in your

Practicing Stoicism 261

stomach. I mentioned above that since becoming a Stoic, I have
become a collector of insults. I have also become a collector
of butterﬂies. I like to engage in activities, such as competitive rowing, that give me butterﬂies simply so I can practice
dealing with them. These feelings are, after all, an important
component of the fear of failure, so that by dealing with them
I am working to overcome my fear of failure. In the hours
before a race, I experience some truly magniﬁcent butterﬂies.
I do my best to turn them to my advantage: They make me
focus on the race that lies ahead. Once a race has begun, I have
the pleasure of watching the butterﬂies depart.
I have also turned elsewhere in my pursuit of butterﬂies.
After I began practicing Stoicism, for example, I decided to
learn how to play a musical instrument, something I had
never done before. The instrument I chose was the banjo.
After several months of lessons, my teacher asked if I wanted
to participate in the recital his students give. I initially rejected
the offer; it sounded like no fun at all to risk public humiliation
trying to play banjo in front of a bunch of strangers. But then
it occurred to me that this was a wonderful opportunity
to cause myself psychological discomfort and to confront—
and hopefully vanquish—my fear of failing. I agreed to
take part.
The recital was the most stress-inducing event I had experienced in a long time. It isn’t that I have a fear of crowds; I can,
with zero anxiety, walk into a classroom of sixty students I have
never met and start lecturing them. But this was different.
Before my performance, I experienced butterﬂies the size of
small bats. Not only that, but I also slipped into an altered state

262

Stoicism for Modern Lives

of consciousness in which time was distorted and the laws
of physics seemed to stop working. But to make a long story
short, I survived the recital.
The butterﬂies I experience racing in a regatta or giving a
banjo recital are, of course, a symptom of anxiety, and it might
seem contrary to Stoic principles to go out of my way to cause
myself anxiety. Indeed, if a goal of Stoicism is the attainment
of tranquility, shouldn’t I go out of my way to avoid anxietyinducing activities? Shouldn’t I, rather than collecting butterﬂies, ﬂee from them?
Not at all. In causing myself anxiety by, for example, giving
a banjo recital, I have precluded much future anxiety in my life.
Now, when faced with a new challenge, I have a wonderful bit
of reasoning I can use: “Compared to the banjo recital, this
new challenge is nothing. I survived that challenge, so surely
I will survive this one.” By taking part in the recital, in other
words, I immunized myself against a fair amount of future
anxiety. It is an immunization, though, that will wear off with
the passage of time, and I will need to be reimmunized with
another dose of butterﬂies.
When doing things to cause myself physical and mental
discomfort, I view myself—or at any rate, a part of me—as an
opponent in a kind of game. This opponent—my “other self,”
as it were—is on evolutionary autopilot: He wants nothing
more than to be comfortable and to take advantage of whatever
opportunities for pleasure present themselves. My other self lacks
self-discipline; left to his own devices, he will always take the path
of least resistance through life and as a result will be little more

Practicing Stoicism 263

than a simple-minded pleasure seeker. He is also a coward. My
other self is not my friend; to the contrary, he is best regarded,
in the words of Epictetus, “as an enemy lying in wait.”4
To win points in the contest with my other self, I must establish my dominance over him. To do this, I must cause him to
experience discomfort he could easily have avoided, and I must
prevent him from experiencing pleasures he might otherwise
have enjoyed. When he is scared of doing something, I must
force him to confront his fears and overcome them.
Why play this game against my other self ? In part to gain selfdiscipline. And why is self-discipline worth possessing? Because
those who possess it have the ability to determine what they do
with their life. Those who lack self-discipline will have the path
they take through life determined by someone or something else,
and as a result, there is a very real danger that they will mislive.
Playing the game against my other self also helps me build
character. These days, I realize, people smirk at talk of building
character, but it is an activity that the Stoics would heartily have
endorsed and would have recommended to anyone wishing to
have a good life.
One other reason for playing the game against my other self
is that it is, somewhat surprisingly, fun to do. It is quite enjoyable to “win a point” in this game by, for example, successfully overcoming a fear. The Stoics realized as much. Epictetus,
as we saw in chapter 7, talks about the pleasure to be derived
from denying ourselves various pleasures.5 Along similar lines,
Seneca reminds us that even though it may be unpleasant to
endure something, we will, on successfully enduring it, be
pleased with ourselves.6

264 Stoicism for Modern Lives

When I row competitively, it may look as though I am trying
to beat the other rowers, but I am in fact engaged in a much
more signiﬁcant competition: the one against my other self.
He didn’t want to learn to row. He didn’t want to do workouts, preferring instead to spend the predawn hours asleep in
a warm bed. He didn’t want to row to the starting line of the
race. (Indeed, on the way there, he repeatedly whined about
how tired he felt.) And during the race, he wanted to quit
rowing and simply let the other rowers win. (“If you just quit
rowing,” he would say in his most seductive voice, “all this
pain would come to an end. Why not just quit? Think of how
good it would feel!”)
It is curious, but my competitors in a race are simultaneously my teammates in the much more important competition
against my other self. By racing against each other, we are all
simultaneously racing against ourselves, although not all of us
are consciously aware of doing so. To race against each other,
we must individually overcome ourselves—our fears, our laziness, our lack of self-discipline. And it is entirely possible for
someone to lose the competition against the other rowers—
indeed, to come in last—but in the process of doing so to have
triumphed in the competition against his other self.
The Stoics, as we have seen, recommend simplifying one’s
lifestyle. Like programs of voluntary discomfort, lifestyle
simplification is a process best left to advanced Stoics. As
I have explained, a novice Stoic will probably want to keep a
low philosophical proﬁle. If you start dressing down, people
will notice. Likewise, people will notice if you keep driving

Practicing Stoicism 265

the same old car or—horrors!—give up the car to take the bus
or ride a bike. People will assume the worst: impending bankruptcy, perhaps, or even the early stages of mental illness. And
if you explain to them that you have overcome your desire to
impress those who are impressed by a person’s external trappings, you will only make matters worse.
When I started experimenting with a simpliﬁed lifestyle, it
took some getting used to. When, for example, someone asked
me where I had gotten the T-shirt I was wearing and I answered
that I had bought it at a thrift store, I found myself feeling a
bit ashamed. This incident made me appreciate Cato’s manner
of dealing with such feelings. Cato, as we have seen, dressed
differently as a kind of training exercise: He wanted to teach
himself “to be ashamed only of what was really shameful.” He
therefore went out of his way to do things that would trigger
inappropriate feelings of shame in himself, simply so he could
practice overcoming such feelings. I have lately been trying to
emulate Cato in this respect.
Since becoming a Stoic, my desires have changed dramatically: I no longer want many of the things I once took to
be essential for proper living. I used to dress nattily, but my
wardrobe has lately become what can best be described as
utilitarian: I have one tie and one sport coat that I can don if
required; fortunately, they are rarely required. I used to long
for a new car, but when my sixteen-year-old car recently died,
I replaced it with a nine-year-old car, something that a decade
ago I could not have imagined myself doing. (The “new” car,
by the way, has two things that my old car lacked: a cup holder

266 Stoicism for Modern Lives

and a working radio. What joy!) There was a time when I
would have understood why someone would want to own a
Rolex watch; now such behavior puzzles me. I used to have
less money than I knew what to do with; this is no longer the
case, in large part because I want so few of the things that
money can buy.
I read that many of my fellow Americans are in deep ﬁnancial trouble. They have an unfortunate tendency to use up all
the credit that is available to them and, when this doesn’t satisfy
their craving for consumer goods, to keep spending anyway.
Many of these individuals, one suspects, would be afﬂuent
rather than bankrupt—and far happier as well—if only they
had developed their capacity to enjoy life’s simple pleasures.
I have become dysfunctional as a consumer. When I go to a
mall, for example, I don’t buy things; instead, I look around me
and am astonished by all the things for sale that I not only don’t
need but can’t imagine myself wanting. My only entertainment
at a mall is to watch the other mall-goers. Most of them,
I suspect, come to the mall not because there is something
speciﬁc that they need to buy. Rather, they come in the hope that
doing so will trigger a desire for something that, before going
to the mall, they didn’t want. It might be a desire for a cashmere
sweater, a set of socket wrenches, or the latest cell phone.
Why go out of their way to trigger a desire? Because if
they trigger one, they can enjoy the rush that comes when
they extinguish that desire by buying its object. It is a rush, of
course, that has as little to do with their long-term happiness
as taking a hit of heroin has to do with the long-term happiness of a heroin addict.

Practicing Stoicism 267

Having said this, I should add that the reason I have so
few consumer desires is not because I consciously ﬁght their
formation. To the contrary, such desires have simply stopped
popping into my head—or at any rate, they don’t pop nearly
as often as they used to. In other words, my ability to form
desires for consumer goods seems to have atrophied.
What brought about this state of affairs? The profound realization, thanks to the practice of Stoicism, that acquiring the
things that those in my social circle typically crave and work
hard to afford will, in the long run, make zero difference in
how happy I am and will in no way contribute to my having
a good life. In particular, were I to acquire a new car, a ﬁne
wardrobe, a Rolex watch, and a bigger house, I am convinced
that I would experience no more joy than I presently do—and
might even experience less.
As a consumer, I seem to have crossed some kind of great
divide. It seems unlikely that, having crossed it, I will ever be
able to return to the mindless consumerism that I once found
to be so entertaining.
Let me now describe a surprising side effect of the practice of
Stoicism. As a Stoic, you will constantly be preparing yourself
for hardship by, for example, engaging in negative visualization
or voluntarily causing yourself discomfort. If hardship doesn’t
follow, it is possible for a curious kind of disappointment to set
in. You might ﬁnd yourself wishing that your Stoicism would
be put to the test so you can see whether you in fact possess
the skills at hardship management that you have worked to
acquire. You are, in other words, like a ﬁreﬁghter who has

268 Stoicism for Modern Lives

practiced his ﬁreﬁghting skills for years but has never been
called on to put out an actual ﬁre or like a football player who,
despite diligently practicing all season long, has never been put
in a game.
Along these lines, the historian Paul Veyne has commented
that if we attempt to practice Stoicism, “a calm life is actually disquieting because we are unaware of whether we would
remain strong in the case of a tempest.”7 Likewise, according
to Seneca, when someone attempts to harm a wise man, he
might actually welcome the attempt, since the injuries can’t
hurt him but can help him: “So far . . . is he from shrinking from
the buffetings of circumstances or of men, that he counts even
injury proﬁtable, for through it he ﬁnds a means of putting
himself to the proof and makes trial of his virtue.”8 Seneca
also suggests that a Stoic might welcome death, inasmuch as it
represents the ultimate test of his Stoicism.9
Although I have not been practicing Stoicism for very long,
I have discovered in myself a desire to have my Stoicism tested.
I already mentioned my desire to be insulted: I want to see
whether I will respond to insults in a Stoically appropriate
manner. I have likewise gone out of my way to put myself
into situations that test my courage and willpower, in part to
see whether I can pass such tests. And while I was writing this
book, an incident took place that gave me a deeper understanding of the Stoics’ desire to have their Stoicism tested.
The incident in question began when I noticed ﬂashes of
light along the periphery of my visual ﬁeld whenever I blinked
my eyes in a dark room. I went to my eye doctor and was
informed that I had a torn retina and that, to prevent my retina

Practicing Stoicism 269

from detaching, I should undergo laser surgery. The nurse who
prepared me for the surgery explained that the doctor would
repeatedly zap my retina with a high-powered laser beam. She
asked whether I had ever seen a light show and said that what
I was about to witness was a spectacle far more splendid than
that. The doctor then entered the room and started zapping
me. The ﬁrst pops of light were indeed intense and beautiful, but then something unexpected happened: I stopped
seeing the bursts of light. I could still hear the laser popping
but saw nothing. Indeed, when the laser was ﬁnally turned
off, all I could see through the eye that had been operated
on was a purple blob that covered my entire visual ﬁeld. It
occurred to me that something might have gone wrong during
the surgery—perhaps the laser had malfunctioned—and that
I might as a result now be blind in one eye.
This thought was unsettling, to be sure, but after having
it, I detected in myself another, wholly unexpected thought:
I found myself reﬂecting on how I would respond to being
blind in one eye. In particular, would I be able to deal with
it in proper Stoic fashion? I was, in other words, responding
to the possible loss of sight in an eye by sizing up the Stoic
test potential of such a loss! This response probably seems
strange to you; it seemed and still seems strange to me as well.
Nevertheless, this was my response, and in responding this
way, I was apparently experiencing a predictable (and some
would say perverse) side effect of the practice of Stoicism.
I informed the nurse that I could not see in the eye that had
been operated on. She told me—at last! why didn’t she tell me
before?—that this was normal and that my vision would come

270 Stoicism for Modern Lives

back within an hour. It did, and as a result I was deprived—thankfully, I think—of this opportunity to have my Stoicism tested.
Unless an untimely death prevents it, I will, in about a decade,
be confronted with a major test of my Stoicism. I will be in my
mid-sixties; I will, in other words, be on the threshold of old age.
Throughout my life, I have sought role models, people who
were in the next stage of life and who, I thought, were handling
that stage successfully. On reaching my ﬁfties, I started examining the seventy- and eighty-year-olds I knew in an attempt
to ﬁnd a role model. It was easy, I discovered, to ﬁnd people
in that age group who could serve as negative role models;
my goal, I thought, should be to avoid ending up like them.
Positive role models, however, proved to be in short supply.
When I went to the seventy- and eighty-year-olds I knew
and asked for advice on dealing with the onset of old age,
they had an annoying tendency to offer the same nugget of
wisdom: “Don’t get old!” Barring the discovery of a “fountain
of youth” drug, though, the only way I can act on this advice
is to commit suicide. (It has subsequently occurred to me that
this is precisely what they were advising me to do, albeit in an
oblique manner. It has also occurred to me that their advice not
to get old echoes Musonius’s observation that “he is blessed
who dies not late but well.”)
It is possible that when I am in my seventies or eighties
I will conclude, as the elderly people I know seem to have
concluded, that nonexistence is preferable to old age. It is also
possible, though, that many of those who ﬁnd old age to be so
burdensome have themselves to blame for their predicament:

Practicing Stoicism 271

They neglected, while young, to prepare for old age. Had they
taken the time to properly prepare themselves—had they, in
particular, started practicing Stoicism—it is conceivable that
they would not have found old age to be burdensome; instead,
they might have found it to be, as Seneca claimed, one of the
most delightful stages of life, a stage that is “full of pleasure if
one knows how to use it.”10
While I was writing this book, my eighty-eight-year-old
mother had a stroke and was banished (by me, as it so happens)
to a nursing home. The stroke so weakened the left side of her
body that she was no longer able to get out of bed by herself.
Not only that, but her ability to swallow was compromised,
making it dangerous for her to eat regular foods and drink
regular liquids, which might go down her windpipe and trigger
a potentially fatal bout of pneumonia. The foods she was served
had to be pureed, and the liquids she was given had to be thickened. (There is, I discovered, a whole line of thickened beverages
that have been created for people with swallowing problems.)
Quite understandably, my mother was unhappy with the
turn her life had taken, and I did my best to encourage her.
Were I devoutly religious, I might have attempted to cheer
her up by praying with her or for her, or by telling her that
I had arranged for tens or even hundreds of people to pray on
her behalf. As it was, though, I found that the best words of
encouragement I had to offer had a distinctly Stoical ring to
them. She would, for example, tell me how difﬁcult her situation was, and I would quote Marcus: “Yes, they say that life is
more like wrestling than like dancing.”

272 Stoicism for Modern Lives

“That’s very true,” she would murmur in reply.
She would ask me what she had to do to be able to walk
again. I thought it was unlikely that she would ever walk
again but did not say as much. Instead, I encouraged her
(without giving a lecture on Stoicism) to internalize her
goals with respect to walking: “What you need to concentrate on is doing your very best when they give you physical
therapy.”
She would complain about having lost most of the function of her left arm, and I would encourage her to engage in
negative visualization: “At least you have the ability to speak,” I
would remind her. “In the ﬁrst days after the stroke, you could
only mumble. Back then, you couldn’t even move your right
arm and consequently couldn’t feed yourself, but now you can.
Really, you have lots to be thankful for.”
She would listen to my reaction and, after a moment of
reﬂection, she would usually respond afﬁrmatively: “I suppose
I do.” The exercise in negative visualization seemed to take the
edge off her distress, if only temporarily.
Time after time during this period, I was struck by how
natural and appropriate it is to invoke Stoic principles to help
someone cope with the challenges of old age and ill health.
I mentioned above that the stroke made it dangerous for
my mother to drink regular, unthickened water. Being denied
water made her, quite naturally, start to crave it. She would ask
me in a pleading voice for a glass of water, “not thick but from
the sink.” I would refuse the request and explain why, but as
soon as I ﬁnished my explanation, she would ask again, “Just

Practicing Stoicism 273

a glass of water. Please!” I found myself in the position of a
loving son who was continually denying his elderly mother’s
request for a simple glass of water.
After enduring my mother’s pleas for a time, I asked the
nurse what to do. “Give her ice cubes to suck on,” she said.
“The water in the ice will be released slowly, so there is little
danger that she will aspirate it.”
As a result of this advice, I became my mother’s personal
ice man, bringing a cup on each visit. (“The ice man cometh!”
I would call out on arriving at her room.) I would pop a cube
into her mouth, and she would, while sucking it, tell me how
wonderful the ice was. My mother, who in her prime had
been a connoisseur of ﬁne food and drink, had now become a
connoisseur of ice cubes. Something she had taken for granted
her entire life—for her, an ice cube had merely been the thing
you use to cool a beverage worth drinking—was now giving
her intense pleasure. She clearly enjoyed this ice more than a
gourmet would enjoy vintage champagne.
Watching her suck appreciatively on ice cubes, I felt a
tinge of envy. Wouldn’t it be wonderful, I thought, to be
able to derive this much pleasure from a simple ice cube?
It is, I decided, unlikely that negative visualization alone
would enable me to appreciate ice cubes as intensely as
my mother does; unfortunately, it would probably take a
stroke like hers to do the trick. Nevertheless, watching her
suck on ice cubes has been quite instructive. It has made me
cognizant of yet another thing that I take utterly for granted:
my ability to gulp down a big glass of cold water on a hot
summer day.

274 Stoicism for Modern Lives

During one visit to my mother, I encountered the Ghost of
Christmas Future. I was walking down the hall of the nursing
home toward my mother’s room. Ahead of me was an elderly
gentleman in a wheelchair being pushed by an attendant.
When I got close, the attendant got my attention and said,
pointing to her charge, “This man is a professor, too.” (My
mother, it turns out, had been telling everyone about me.)
I stopped and said hello to this fellow academic, who, it
turned out, had retired some time before. We chatted for a
while, but during our conversation I was haunted by the
thought that in a few decades’ time I might have this conversation again, only then it would be me in the wheelchair
and it would be some younger professor standing in front of
me, taking a few moments out of his busy day to talk to an
academic relic.
My time is coming, I told myself, and I must do what I can
to prepare for it.
The goal of Stoicism, as we have seen, is the attainment
of tranquility. Readers will naturally want to know whether
my own practice of Stoicism has helped me attain this goal.
It has not, alas, allowed me to attain perfect tranquility. It has,
however, resulted in my being substantially more tranquil than
was formerly the case.
In particular, I have made considerable progress in taming
my negative emotions. I am less prone to anger than I used to
be, and when I ﬁnd myself venting my anger at others I am
much more willing to apologize than was formerly the case.
I am not only more tolerant of put-downs than I used to be

Practicing Stoicism 275

but have developed a near-complete immunity to gardenvariety insults. I am also less anxious than I once was about the
disasters that might befall me and in particular about my own
death—although the real test for this, as Seneca says, will be
when I am about to take my last breath.
Having said this, I should add that although I may have
tamed my negative emotions, I have not eradicated them; nor
is it likely that I ever will. I am nevertheless delighted to have
deprived these emotions of some of the power they used to
have over me.
One signiﬁcant psychological change that has taken place
since I started practicing Stoicism is that I experience far less
dissatisfaction than I used to. Apparently as the result of practicing negative visualization, I have become quite appreciative of
what I’ve got. There remains, to be sure, the question of whether
I would continue to be appreciative if my circumstances changed
dramatically; perhaps, without realizing it, I have come to cling
to the things I appreciate, in which case I would be devastated to
lose those things. I won’t know the answer to this question, of
course, until my Stoicism is put to the test.
One other discovery I have made in my practice of Stoicism
concerns joy. The joy the Stoics were interested in can best
be described as a kind of objectless enjoyment—an enjoyment not of any particular thing but of all this. It is a delight
in simply being able to participate in life. It is a profound realization that even though all this didn’t have to be possible, it is
possible—wonderfully, magniﬁcently possible.
For the record, my practice of Stoicism has not enabled me
to experience unbroken joy; far from it. Nor have I experienced

276 Stoicism for Modern Lives

the higher kind of joy that a Stoic sage might experience,
a joy at the realization that his joy cannot be disrupted by
external events. But my practice of Stoicism does seem to
have made me susceptible to periodic outbursts of delight in
all this.
It is curious, but when I started experiencing these outbursts,
I wasn’t quite sure what to make of them. Should I embrace my
feelings of joy or hold them at arm’s length? Indeed, should I, as
a sober-minded adult, attempt to extinguish them? (I have since
discovered that I am not alone in being suspicious of feelings of
joy.) Then it dawned on me what utter foolishness it would be
to do anything other than embrace them. And so I have.
These comments, I realize, make me sound disgustingly
self-satisfied, and boastful to boot. Rest assured that the
practice of Stoicism does not require people to go around
telling others how delighted they are to be alive or about the
outbursts of joy they have lately been experiencing; indeed,
the Stoics doubtless would have discouraged this sort of
thing. Why, then, am I telling you about my state of mind?
Because it answers the question you naturally have: Does
Stoicism deliver the psychological goods it promises? In my
case it did, to a more than satisfactory extent. Having made
this point, though, I will in the future do my best to be admirably modest in any public assessments I offer regarding my
state of mind.
Although I am a practicing Stoic, let me confess, in these
closing paragraphs, that I have some misgivings about the
philosophy.

Practicing Stoicism 277

According to the Stoics, if I seek tranquility, I need to give
up other goals that someone in my circumstances might have,
such as to own an expensive, late-model car or to live in a
million-dollar home. But what if everyone else is right and the
Stoics are wrong? There is a chance that I will someday look
back on what I will then term “my Stoic phase” and be both
bafﬂed and dismayed. “What was I thinking?” I will ask myself.
“If only I could have those years back!”
I am not the only Stoic to harbor such doubts. In his essay
on tranquility, for example, Seneca has an imaginary conversation with Serenus, a Stoic with misgivings about Stoicism.
When Serenus has been among people with normal values—
for example, after he has dined in a house “where one even
treads on precious stones and riches are scattered about in
every corner”—he discovers within himself “a secret sting and
the doubt whether the other life is not better.”11 The above
comments make it clear that I, too, have felt this “secret sting.”
It doesn’t help that those who think fame and fortune are
more valuable than tranquility vastly outnumber those who, like
myself, think tranquility is more valuable. Can all these other
people be mistaken? Surely I am the one making the mistake!
At the same time, I know, thanks to my research on desire, that
almost without exception the philosophers and religious thinkers
who have contemplated life and the way people normally live
it have come to the conclusion that it is the vast majority of
people who are making a mistake in their manner of living.
These thinkers have also tended to gravitate toward tranquility as
something very much worth pursuing, although many of them
disagreed with the Stoics on how best to pursue it.

278 Stoicism for Modern Lives

When I start having second thoughts about Stoicism, my
current practice is to recall that we live in a world in which
certainty is possible only in mathematics. We live, in other
words, in a world in which, no matter what you do, you might
be making a mistake. This means that although it is true that
I might be making a mistake by practicing Stoicism, I might
also be making a mistake if I reject Stoicism in favor of some
other philosophy of life. And I think the biggest mistake, the
one made by a huge number of people, is to have no philosophy of life at all. These people feel their way through life
by following the promptings of their evolutionary programming, by assiduously seeking out what feels good and avoiding
what feels bad. By doing this, they might have a comfortable
life or even a life ﬁlled with pleasure. The question remains,
however, whether they could have a better life by turning their
back on their evolutionary programming and instead devoting
time and energy to acquiring a philosophy of life. According
to the Stoics, the answer to this question is that a better life is
possible—one containing, perhaps, less comfort and pleasure,
but considerably more joy.
I suspect that in coming decades (should I live that long)
whatever doubts I may have had about Stoicism will fall by
the wayside as the aging process takes its toll. Stoic techniques
can improve a life when times are good, but it is when times
are bad that the efﬁcacy of these techniques becomes most
apparent. If I ﬁnd Stoicism to be beneﬁcial in my sixth decade
of life, I am likely to ﬁnd it to be indispensable in my eighth or
ninth decade. Unless I am an unusual person, my biggest tests
in life lie ahead. I will, I think, be glad to have developed an

Practicing Stoicism 279

understanding and appreciation of Stoicism before these tests
are administered.
It would be nice to have a proof that Stoicism (or some other
philosophy of life) is the “correct” philosophy. Unfortunately,
the proof offered by the Stoics is unconvincing, and an alternative proof is unlikely to be forthcoming. In the absence of such
a proof, we must act on the basis of probabilities. For a certain
kind of person—for a person in certain circumstances with a
certain personality type—there are many reasons to think that
Stoicism is worth a try. Practicing Stoicism doesn’t take much
effort; indeed, it takes far less effort than the effort one is likely
to waste in the absence of a philosophy of life. One can practice Stoicism without anyone’s being any the wiser, and one
can practice it for a time and then abandon it and be no worse
off for the attempt. There is, in other words, little to lose by
giving Stoicism a try as one’s philosophy of life, and there is
potentially much to gain.
Indeed, according to Marcus,12 it is possible, through the
practice of Stoicism, to gain a whole new life.

A Stoic Reading Program

Many philosophical writings are inaccessible to nonphilosophers. This cannot be said, though, of most of the writings of
the Stoics. Readers of this book are therefore encouraged to
take a look at Stoic primary sources. On doing this, they might
discover that their own interpretation of the Stoics differs from
mine, and they will certainly discover that in the process of
writing this book, there were many nuggets of Stoic wisdom
and insight that I had to omit.
Those wishing to read the Stoics would do well to start
with the essays of Seneca, especially, “On the Happy Life,”
“On Tranquility of Mind,” and “On the Shortness of Life.”
These can be found in Seneca: Dialogues and Essays (Oxford
University Press, 2008). Alternatively, they are available in
volume 2 of Seneca: Moral Essays, in the Loeb Classical Library.
(This volume also has the advantage of being small enough to
ﬁt into a pocket or purse. Thus, if readers ﬁnd themselves at a
banquet given by nonphilosophers and the talk turns to inappropriate things, they can slip off to a quiet corner, pull out
their copy of Seneca, and read.)

282 A Stoic Reading Program

Seneca’s letters to Lucilius also merit attention. There are
more than a hundred of these letters, and some are of more
interest than others. Furthermore, the letters themselves tend
to focus on different topics. In Letter 83, for example, Seneca
talks about alcohol; in Letters 12 and 26, about old age; and
in Letter 7, about gladiatorial contests. (He describes how,
during breaks in the show, spectators would yell out to have
some throats cut just so there would be something for them
to watch.) Many readers would therefore do well to get a book
containing a selection of these letters.
Musonius Rufus is worth reading for his practical advice
on daily living. The only published translation of Musonius
that I know of, though, is Cora Lutz’s “Musonius Rufus: ‘The
Roman Socrates,’ ” in volume 10 of Yale Classical Studies
(1947), which is difﬁcult to buy or borrow. Readers are therefore encouraged to visit my author website (williambirvine.
com) for information on how to obtain a copy of Cynthia
King’s translation of Musonius’s works. (This is the translation
I quote from in this book.)
Readers wishing to sample Epictetus are encouraged to start
with his Handbook (also known as his Manual or Encheiridion).
It has the advantage of being short, easily obtainable, and philosophically accessible. In the world of philosophical literature,
it stands out as a gem.
Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is also both accessible
and readily available. Reading the Meditations can be a bit
frustrating, though, inasmuch as it is a collection of disconnected (except for the Stoic theme) and sometimes repetitious
observations.

A Stoic Reading Program 283

Readers might also be interested in branching out beyond
the Stoics. They might, for example, take a look at Diogenes
Laertius’s biographical sketches of the Greek Stoics. The
sketches of Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus can
be found in volume 2 of Diogenes Laertius, also in the Loeb
Classical Library. And while the reader has possession of this
volume, it might be fun to take a look at the biographical
sketch of Diogenes of Sinope, the Cynic. He combines wisdom
with humor in a most admirable manner.
Readers might also want to take a look at Arthur
Schopenhauer’s essays in The Wisdom of Life and Counsels
and Maxims. Although not explicitly Stoical, these essays have
a distinctly Stoical tone. Readers might also be interested in
the novelist Tom Wolfe’s A Man in Full, in which a character
accidentally discovers Stoicism and subsequently starts practicing it. Finally, readers can get some insight into the practice
of Stoicism under difﬁcult circumstances by reading James B.
Stockdale’s Courage under Fire: Testing Epictetus’s Doctrines
in a Laboratory of Human Behavior.
Enjoy!

1. Technically, Epictetus was not a Roman inasmuch as he was not a
Roman citizen; nevertheless, the Stoicism he practiced was the Romanized form of the doctrine, and for that reason I include him among the
Roman Stoics.

7. Seneca, Ad Lucilium, XXIII.3.
8. Having said this, I should add that some classicists refuse to take Seneca’s comments about joy at face value. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum, for example, points out that Seneca, immediately after offering
the above advice to Lucilius, goes on to explain what he means by joy:
It is not, says Seneca, a “sweetly agreeable” kind of joy; rather, the joy
Seneca has in mind is “a stern matter.” See Nussbaum, 400. I would

Notes to Pages 49–58 287

argue, however, that in saying this, Seneca is simply trying to distinguish
Stoic joy from related mental states. When, for example, he tells Lucilius
not to assume that “he who laughs has joy” (Ad Lucilium, XXIII.3) he is
distinguishing joy from elation: A person can be elated and can therefore laugh, even though he is not experiencing joy—think, for example,
about someone who gains a state of elation by using crystal meth.

4. As the supreme god, Zeus had it in his power to override the decisions
of the Fates but usually chose not to do so for pragmatic reasons. In
the Iliad (16.440–49), for example, Homer describes an episode in which
Zeus complains to Hera that Sarpedon is fated to be slain by Patroclus.
Zeus is considering interfering with events in order to save Sarpedon’s
life. Hera implores him not to do this, since it would result in the other
gods also interfering with earthly events, which would in turn create
great discord among them.

PREFACE

It was the late first century AD and Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Rome’s
most influential power broker, its greatest living playwright, and
its wisest philosopher, was struggling to work.
The problem was the ear-shattering, soul-rattling noise that
poured in from the street below.
Rome had always been a loud city—think New York City
construction loud—but the block where Seneca was staying was a
deafening cacophony of disturbances. Athletes worked out in the
gymnasium underneath his suite of rooms, dropping heavy weights.
A masseuse pummeled the backs of old fat men. Swimmers splashed
in the water. At the entrance of the building, a pickpocket was being
arrested and making a scene. Passing carriages rumbled over the
stone streets, while carpenters hammered away in their shops and
vendors shouted their wares. Children laughed and played. Dogs
barked.
And more than the noise outside his window, there was the
simple fact that Seneca’s life was falling apart. It was crisis upon
crisis upon crisis. Overseas unrest threatened his finances. He was
getting older and could feel it. He had been pushed out of politics by
his enemies, and, now on the outs with Nero, he could easily—at the
emperor’s whim—lose his head.
It was not, we can imagine from the perspective of our own busy
lives, a great environment for a human to get anything done.
Unconducive to thinking, creating, writing, or making good
decisions. The noise and distractions of the empire were enough “to
make me hate my very powers of hearing,” Seneca told a friend.

Yet for good reason, this scene has tantalized admirers for
centuries. How does a man, besieged by adversity and difficulty, not
only not go out of his mind, but actually find the serenity to think
clearly and to write incisive, perfectly crafted essays, some in that
very room, which would reach millions upon millions and touch on
truths that few have ever accessed?
“I have toughened my nerves against all that sort of thing,”
Seneca explained to that same friend about the noise. “I force my
mind to concentrate, and keep it from straying to things outside
itself; all outdoors may be bedlam, provided that there is no
disturbance within.”
Ah, isn’t that what we all crave? What discipline! What focus! To
be able to tune out our surroundings, to access one’s full capabilities
at any time, in any place, despite every difficulty? How wonderful
that would be! What we’d be able to accomplish! How much happier
we would be!
To Seneca and to his fellow adherents of Stoic philosophy, if a
person could develop peace within themselves—if they could achieve
apatheia, as they called it—then the whole world could be at war,
and they could still think well, work well, and be well. “You may be
sure that you are at peace with yourself,” Seneca wrote, “when no
noise reaches you, when no word shakes you out of yourself, whether
it be flattery or a threat, or merely an empty sound buzzing about you
with unmeaning sin.” In this state, nothing could touch them (not
even a deranged emperor), no emotion could disturb them, no threat
could interrupt them, and every beat of the present moment would
be theirs for living.
It’s a powerful idea made all the more transcendent by the
remarkable fact that nearly every other philosophy of the ancient
world—no matter how different or distant—came to the exact same
conclusion.
It wouldn’t have mattered whether you were a pupil at the feet of
Confucius in 500 BC, a student of the early Greek philosopher
Democritus one hundred years later, or sitting in Epicurus’s garden a
generation after that—you would have heard equally emphatic calls
for this imperturbability, unruffledness, and tranquility.

The Buddhist word for it was upekkha. The Muslims spoke of
aslama. The Hebrews, hishtavut. The second book of the Bhagavad
Gita, the epic poem of the warrior Arjuna, speaks of samatvam, an
“evenness of mind—a peace that is ever the same.” The Greeks,
euthymia and hesychia. The Epicureans, ataraxia. The Christians,
aequanimitas.
In English: stillness.
To be steady while the world spins around you. To act without
frenzy. To hear only what needs to be heard. To possess quietude—
exterior and interior—on command.
To tap into the dao and the logos. The Word. The Way.
Buddhism. Stoicism. Epicureanism. Christianity. Hinduism. It’s
all but impossible to find a philosophical school or religion that does
not venerate this inner peace—this stillness—as the highest good and
as the key to elite performance and a happy life.
And when basically all the wisdom of the ancient world agrees on
something, only a fool would decline to listen.

INTRODUCTION

T

he call to stillness comes quietly. The modern world does not.
In addition to the clatter and chatter and intrigue and
infighting that would be familiar to the citizens of Seneca’s time, we
have car horns, stereos, cell phone alarms, social media notifications,
chainsaws, airplanes.
Our personal and professional problems are equally
overwhelming. Competitors muscle into our industry. Our desks pile
high with papers and our inboxes overflow with messages. We are
always reachable, which means that arguments and updates are
never far away. The news bombards us with one crisis after another
on every screen we own—of which there are many. The grind of work
wears us down and seems to never stop. We are overfed and
undernourished. Overstimulated, overscheduled, and lonely.
Who has the power to stop? Who has time to think? Is there
anyone not affected by the din and dysfunctions of our time?
While the magnitude and urgency of our struggle is modern, it is
rooted in a timeless problem. Indeed, history shows that the ability
to cultivate quiet and quell the turmoil inside us, to slow the mind
down, to understand our emotions, and to conquer our bodies has
always been extremely difficult. “All of humanity’s problems,” Blaise
Pascal said in 1654, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a
room alone.”
In evolution, distinct species—like birds and bats—have often
evolved similar adaptations in order to survive. The same goes for
the philosophical schools separated by vast oceans and distances.
They developed unique paths to the same critical destination: The

stillness required to become master of one’s own life. To survive and
thrive in any and every environment, no matter how loud or busy.
Which is why this idea of stillness is not some soft New Age
nonsense or the domain of monks and sages, but in fact desperately
necessary to all of us, whether we’re running a hedge fund or playing
in a Super Bowl, pioneering research in a new field or raising a
family. It is an attainable path to enlightenment and excellence,
greatness and happiness, performance as well as presence, for every
kind of person.
Stillness is what aims the archer’s arrow. It inspires new ideas. It
sharpens perspective and illuminates connections. It slows the ball
down so that we might hit it. It generates a vision, helps us resist the
passions of the mob, makes space for gratitude and wonder. Stillness
allows us to persevere. To succeed. It is the key that unlocks the
insights of genius, and allows us regular folks to understand them.
The promise of this book is the location of that key . . . and a call
not only for possessing stillness, but for radiating it outward like a
star—like the sun—for a world that needs light more than ever.

The Key to Everything
In the early days of the American Civil War, there were a hundred
competing plans for how to secure victory and whom to appoint to do
it. From every general and for every battle there was an endless
supply of criticism and dangerous passions—there was paranoia and
fear, ego and arrogance, and very little in the way of hope.
There is a wonderful scene from those fraught first moments
when Abraham Lincoln addressed a group of generals and politicians
in his office at the White House. Most people at that time believed
the war could only be won through enormous, decisively bloody
battles in the country’s biggest cities, like Richmond and New
Orleans and even, potentially, Washington, D.C.
Lincoln, a man who taught himself military strategy by poring
over books he checked out from the Library of Congress, laid out a
map across a big table and pointed instead to Vicksburg, Mississippi,
a little city deep in Southern territory. It was a fortified town high on

the bluffs of the Mississippi River, held by the toughest rebel troops.
Not only did it control navigation of that important waterway, but it
was a juncture for a number of other important tributaries, as well as
rail lines that supplied Confederate armies and enormous slave
plantations across the South.
“Vicksburg is the key,” he told the crowd with the certainty of a
man who had studied a matter so intensely that he could express it in
the simplest of terms. “The war can never be brought to a close until
that key is in our pocket.”
As it happened, Lincoln turned out to be exactly right. It would
take years, it would take incredible equanimity and patience, as well
as ferocious commitment to his cause, but the strategy laid out in
that room was what won the war and ended slavery in America
forever. Every other important victory in the Civil War—from
Gettysburg to Sherman’s March to the Sea to Lee’s surrender—was
made possible because at Lincoln’s instruction Ulysses S. Grant laid
siege to Vicksburg in 1863, and by taking the city split the South in
two and gained control of that important waterway. In his reflective,
intuitive manner, without being rushed or distracted, Lincoln had
seen (and held fast to) what his own advisors, and even his enemy,
had missed. Because he possessed the key that unlocked victory from
the rancor and folly of all those early competing plans.
In our own lives, we face a seemingly equal number of problems
and are pulled in countless directions by competing priorities and
beliefs. In the way of everything we hope to accomplish, personally
and professionally, sit obstacles and enemies. Martin Luther King Jr.
observed that there was a violent civil war raging within each and
every person—between our good and bad impulses, between our
ambitions and our principles, between what we can be and how hard
it is to actually get there.
In those battles, in that war, stillness is the river and the railroad
junction through which so much depends. It is the key . . .
To thinking clearly.
To seeing the whole chessboard.
To making tough decisions.
To managing our emotions.

To identifying the right goals.
To handling high-pressure situations.
To maintaining relationships.
To building good habits.
To being productive.
To physical excellence.
To feeling fulfilled.
To capturing moments of laughter and joy.
Stillness is the key to, well, just about everything.
To being a better parent, a better artist, a better investor, a better
athlete, a better scientist, a better human being. To unlocking all that
we are capable of in this life.

This Stillness Can Be Yours
Anyone who has concentrated so deeply that a flash of insight or
inspiration suddenly visited them knows stillness. Anyone who has
given their best to something, felt pride of completion, of knowing
they left absolutely nothing in reserve—that’s stillness. Anyone who
has stepped forward with the eyes of the crowd upon them and then
poured all their training into a single moment of performance—that’s
stillness, even if it involves active movement. Anyone who has spent
time with that special, wise person, and witnessed them solve in two
seconds the problem that had vexed us for months—stillness. Anyone
who has walked out alone on a quiet street at night as the snow fell,
and watched as the light fell softly on that snow and is warmed by the
contentment of being alive—that too is stillness.
Staring at the blank page in front of us and watching as the words
pour out in perfect prose, at a loss for where they came from;
standing on fine white sand, looking out at the ocean, or really any
part of nature, and feeling like part of something bigger than oneself;
a quiet evening with a loved one; the satisfaction of having done a
good turn for another person; sitting, alone with our thoughts, and
seizing for the first time the ability to think about them as we were
thinking them. Stillness.

Sure, there is a certain ineffableness to what we’re talking about,
to articulating the stillness that the poet Rainer Maria Rilke
described as “full, complete” where “all the random and approximate
were muted.”
“Although we speak of attaining the dao,” Lao Tzu once said,
“there is really nothing to obtain.” Or to borrow a master’s reply to a
student who asked where he might find Zen: “You are seeking for an
ox while you are yourself on it.”
You have tasted stillness before. You have felt it in your soul. And
you want more of it.
You need more of it.
Which is why the aim of this book is simply to show how to
uncover and draw upon the stillness we already possess. It’s about
the cultivation of and the connection to that powerful force given to
us at birth, the one that has atrophied in our modern, busy lives. This
book is an attempt to answer the pressing question of our time: If the
quiet moments are the best moments, and if so many wise, virtuous
people have sung their praises, why are they so rare?
Well, the answer is that while we may naturally possess stillness,
accessing it is not easy. One must really listen to hear it speaking to
us. And answering the call requires stamina and mastery. “To hold
the mind still is an enormous discipline,” the late comedian Garry
Shandling reminded himself in his journal as he struggled to manage
fame and fortune and health problems, “one which must be faced
with the greatest commitment of your life.”
The pages that follow tell the stories and strategies of men and
women who were just like you, who struggled as you struggle amid
the noise and responsibilities of life, but managed to succeed in
finding and harnessing stillness. You will hear stories of the triumphs
and trials of John F. Kennedy and Fred Rogers, Anne Frank and
Queen Victoria. There will be stories about Jesus and Tiger Woods,
Socrates, Napoleon, the composer John Cage, Sadaharu Oh, Rosanne
Cash, Dorothy Day, Buddha, Leonardo da Vinci, Socrates, and
Marcus Aurelius.
We will also draw on poetry and novels, philosophical texts and
scientific research. We will raid every school and every era we can to
find strategies to help us direct our thoughts, process our emotions,

and master our bodies. So we can do less . . . and do more.
Accomplish more but need it less. Feel better and be better at the
same time.
To achieve stillness, we’ll need to focus on three domains, the
timeless trinity of mind, body, soul—the head, the heart, the flesh.
In each domain, we will seek to reduce the disturbances and
perturbations that make stillness impossible. To cease to be at war
with the world and within ourselves, and to establish a lasting inner
and outer peace instead.
You know that is what you want—and what you deserve. That’s
why you picked up this book.
So let us answer the call together. Let us find—let us lock into—
the stillness that we seek.

THE DOMAIN OF THE MIND

T

he entire world changed in the few short hours between when
John F. Kennedy went to bed on October 15, 1962, and when he
woke up the following morning.
Because while the president slept, the CIA identified the ongoing
construction of medium- and long-range Soviet ballistic nuclear
missile sites on the island of Cuba, just ninety miles from American
shores. As Kennedy would tell a stunned American public days later,
“Each of these missiles is capable of striking Washington, D.C., the
Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the
southeastern part of the United States, in Central America, or in the
Caribbean.”
As Kennedy received his first briefing on what we now know as
the Cuban Missile Crisis—or simply as the Thirteen Days—the
president could consider only the appalling stakes. As many as
seventy million people were expected to die in the first strikes
between the United States and Russia. But that was just a guess—no
one actually knew how terrible nuclear war would be.
What Kennedy knew for certain was that he faced an
unprecedented escalation of the long-brewing Cold War between the
United States and the USSR. And whatever factors had contributed
to its creation, no matter how inevitable war must have appeared, it
fell on him, at the very least, to just not make things worse. Because
it might mean the end of life on planet Earth.
Kennedy was a young president born into immense privilege,
raised by an aggressive father who hated to lose, in a family whose
motto, they joked, was “Don’t Get Mad, Get Even.” With almost no
executive leadership experience under his belt, it’s not a surprise,

then, that the first year and half of Kennedy’s administration had not
gone well.
In April 1961, Kennedy had tried and failed—embarrassingly so—
to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs. Just a
few months later, he was diplomatically dominated by Soviet premier
Nikita Khrushchev in a series of meetings in Vienna. (Kennedy would
call it the “roughest thing in my life.”) Sensing his adversary’s
political weakness, and likely aware of the chronic physical frailty he
endured from Addison’s disease and back injuries suffered during
World War II, Khrushchev repeatedly lied to Kennedy about any
weapons being placed in Cuba, insisting that they would be for
defensive purposes only.
Which is to say that during the Missile Crisis, Kennedy faced, as
every leader will at some point in their tenure, a difficult test amid
complicating personal and political circumstances. There were many
questions: Why would Khrushchev do this? What was his endgame?
What was the man possibly trying to accomplish? Was there a way to
solve it? What did Kennedy’s advisors think? What were Kennedy’s
options? Was he up to this task? Did he have what it took?
The fate of millions depended on his answers.
The advice from Kennedy’s advisors was immediate and
emphatic: The missile sites must be destroyed with the full might of
the country’s military arsenal. Every second wasted risked the safety
and the reputation of the United States. After the surprise attack on
the missiles, a full-scale invasion of Cuba by American troops would
need to follow. This, they said, was not only more than justified by
the actions of the USSR and Cuba, but it was Kennedy’s only option.
Their logic was both primal and satisfying: Aggression must be
met with aggression. Tit replied to with tat.
The only problem was that if their logic turned out to be wrong,
no one would be around to account for their mistake. Because
everyone would be dead.
Unlike in the early days of his presidency, when Kennedy allowed
the CIA to pressure him into supporting the Bay of Pigs fiasco, this
time he surprised everyone by pushing back. He had recently read
Barbara Tuchman’s The Guns of August, a book about the beginning
of World War I, which imprinted on his mind the image of

overconfident world leaders rushing their way into a conflict that,
once started, they couldn’t stop. Kennedy wanted everyone to slow
down so that they could really think about the problem in front of
them.
This is, in fact, the first obligation of a leader and a decision
maker. Our job is not to “go with our gut” or fixate on the first
impression we form about an issue. No, we need to be strong enough
to resist thinking that is too neat, too plausible, and therefore almost
always wrong. Because if the leader can’t take the time to develop a
clear sense of the bigger picture, who will? If the leader isn’t thinking
through all the way to the end, who is?
We can see in Kennedy’s handwritten notes taken during the
crisis, a sort of meditative process by which he tried to do precisely
this. On numerous pages, he writes “Missile. Missile. Missile,” or
“Veto. Veto. Veto. Veto,” or “Leaders. Leaders. Leaders.” On one
page, showing his desire to not act alone or selfishly: “Consensus.
Consensus. Consensus. Consensus. Consensus. Consensus.” On a
yellow legal pad during one meeting, Kennedy drew two sailboats,
calming himself with thoughts of the ocean he loved so much.
Finally, on White House stationery, as if to clarify to himself the only
thing that mattered, he wrote one short sentence: “We are
demanding withdrawal of the missiles.”
Perhaps it was there, as Kennedy sat with his advisors and
doodled, that he remembered a passage from another book he’d
read, by the strategist B. H. Liddell Hart, on nuclear strategy. In
Kennedy’s review of Hart’s book for the Saturday Review of
Literature a few years before, he quoted this passage:
Keep strong, if possible. In any case, keep cool. Have
unlimited patience. Never corner an opponent, and always
assist him to save face. Put yourself in his shoes—so as to
see things through his eyes. Avoid self-righteousness like
the devil—nothing is so self-blinding.
It became Kennedy’s motto during the Missile Crisis. “I think we
ought to think of why the Russians did this,” he told his advisors.

What is the advantage they are trying to get? he asked, with real
interest. “Must be some major reason for the Soviets to set this up.”
As Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Kennedy’s advisor and biographer, wrote,
“With his capacity to understand the problems of others, the
President could see how threatening the world might have looked to
the Kremlin.”
This understanding would help him respond properly to this
unexpected and dangerous provocation—and give him insight into
how the Soviets would react to that response.
It became clear to Kennedy that Khrushchev put the missiles in
Cuba because he believed Kennedy was weak. But that didn’t mean
the Russians believed their own position was particularly strong.
Only a desperate nation would take such a risk, Kennedy realized.
Armed with this insight, which came through long discussions with
his team—designated as ExComm—he began to formulate an action
plan.
Clearly, a military strike was the most irrevocable of all the
options (nor, according to his advisors, was it likely to be 100 percent
effective). What would happen after that, Kennedy wondered? How
many soldiers would die in an invasion? How would the world
respond to a larger country invading a smaller one, even if it was to
deter a nuclear threat? What would the Russians do to save face or
protect their soldiers on the island?
These questions pointed Kennedy toward a blockade of Cuba.
Nearly half of his advisors opposed this less aggressive move, but he
favored it precisely because it preserved his options.
The blockade also embodied the wisdom of one of Kennedy’s
favorite expressions: It used time as a tool. It gave both sides a
chance to examine the stakes of the crisis and offered Khrushchev
the opportunity to reevaluate his impression of Kennedy’s supposed
weakness.
Some would later attack Kennedy for this choice, too. Why
challenge Russia at all? Why were the missiles such a big deal? Didn’t
the United States have plenty of their own pointed at the Soviets?
Kennedy was not unsympathetic to this argument, but as he
explained to the American public in an address on October 22, it
wasn’t possible to simply back down:

The 1930s taught us a clear lesson: Aggressive conduct, if
allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately
leads to war. This nation is opposed to war. We are also
true to our word. Our unswerving objective, therefore,
must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or
any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or
elimination from the Western Hemisphere. . . . We will not
prematurely or unnecessarily risk the costs of worldwide
nuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would be
ashes in our mouth—but neither will we shrink from that
risk at any time it must be faced.
What’s most remarkable about this conclusion is how calmly
Kennedy came to it. Despite the enormous stress of the situation, we
can hear in tapes and see in transcripts and photos taken at the time
just how collaborative and open everyone was. No fighting, no raised
voices. No finger-pointing (and when things did get tense, Kennedy
laughed it off). Kennedy didn’t let his own ego dominate the
discussions, nor did he allow anyone else’s to. When he sensed that
his presence was stifling his advisors’ ability to speak honestly, he left
the room so they could debate and brainstorm freely. Reaching
across party lines and past rivalries, he consulted openly with the
three still-living ex-presidents and invited the previous secretary of
state, Dean Acheson, into the top-secret meetings as an equal.
In the tensest moments, Kennedy sought solitude in the White
House Rose Garden (afterward, he would thank the gardener for her
important contributions during the crisis). He would go for long
swims, both to clear his mind and to think. He sat in his specially
made rocking chair in the Oval Office, bathed in the light of those
enormous windows, easing the pain in his back so that it might not
add to the fog of (cold) war that had descended so thickly over
Washington and Moscow.
There is a picture of Kennedy with his back to the room, hunched
over, leaning both fists on the big desk he had been chosen by
millions of voters to occupy. This is a man with the fate of the world
on his shoulders. He has been provoked by a nuclear superpower in a
surprise act of bad faith. Critics are questioning his courage. There

are political considerations, personal considerations, there are more
factors than any one person should be able to weigh at one time.
Yet he lets none of this rush him. None of it will cloud his
judgment or deter him from doing the right thing. He is the stillest
guy in the room.
Kennedy would need to stay that way, because simply deciding on
the blockade was only the first step. Next came announcing and
enforcing this five-hundred-mile no-go zone around Cuba (which he
brilliantly called a “quarantine” to underplay the more aggressive
implications of a “blockade”). There would be more belligerent
accusations from the Russians and confrontations at the UN.
Congressional leaders voiced their doubts. One hundred thousand
troops still had to be readied in Florida as a contingency.
Then there would be the actual provocations. A Russian tanker
ship approached the quarantine line. Russian submarines surfaced.
An American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Cuba, and the pilot
killed.
The two biggest and most powerful countries in the world were
“eyeball to eyeball.” It was actually scarier and more dire than
anyone knew—some of the Soviet missiles, which had been
previously thought to be only partly assembled, were armed and
ready. Even if this wasn’t known, the awful danger could be felt.
Would Kennedy’s emotions get the best of him? Would he blink?
Would he break?
No. He wouldn’t.
“It isn’t the first step that concerns me,” he said to his advisors as
much as to himself, “but both sides escalating to the fourth and fifth
step—and we don’t go to the sixth because there is no one around to
do so. We must remind ourselves we are embarking on a very
hazardous course.”
The space Kennedy gave Khrushchev to breathe and think paid
off just in time. On October 26, eleven days into the crisis, the Soviet
premier wrote Kennedy a letter saying that he now saw that the two
of them were pulling on a rope with a knot in the middle—a knot of
war. The harder each pulled, the less likely it would be that they
could ever untie it, and eventually there would be no choice but to
cut the rope with a sword. And then Khrushchev provided an even

more vivid analogy, one as true in geopolitics as it is in everyday life:
“If people do not display statesmanlike wisdom,” he said, “they will
eventually reach the point where they will clash, like blind moles,
and then mutual annihilation will commence.”
Suddenly, the crisis was over as quickly as it began. The Russians,
realizing that their position was untenable and that their test of U.S.
resolve had failed, made signs that they would negotiate—that they
would remove the missiles. The ships stopped dead in the water.
Kennedy was ready too. He pledged that the United States would not
invade Cuba, giving the Russians and their allies a win. In secret, he
also let the Russians know that he was willing to remove American
missiles in Turkey, but would do so in several months’ time so as not
to give the impression that he could be pressured into abandoning an
ally.
With clear thinking, wisdom, patience, and a keen eye for the root
of a complex, provocative conflict, Kennedy had saved the world
from a nuclear holocaust.
We might say that Kennedy, if only for this brief period of a little
less than two weeks, managed to achieve that stage of clarity spoken
about in the ancient Chinese text The Daodejing. As he stared down
nuclear annihilation, he was:
Careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream.
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.
Courteous as a guest.
Fluid as melting ice.
Shapable as a block of wood.
Receptive as a valley.
Clear as a glass of water.
The Daoists would say that he had stilled the muddied water in
his mind until he could see through it. Or to borrow the image from
the emperor Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic philosopher who himself had
stared down countless crises and challenges, Kennedy had been “like
the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands, unmoved and
the raging of the sea falls still around it.”

Each of us will, in our own lives, face crisis. The stakes may be
lower, but to us they will matter. A business on the brink of collapse.
An acrimonious divorce. A decision about the future of our career. A
moment where the whole game depends on us. These situations will
call upon all our mental resources. An emotional, reactive response—
an unthinking, half-baked response—will not cut it. Not if we want to
get it right. Not if we want to perform at our best.
What we will need then is that same stillness that Kennedy drew
upon. His calmness. His open-mindedness. His empathy. His clarity
about what really mattered.
In these situations we must:
Be fully present.
Empty our mind of preconceptions.
Take our time.
Sit quietly and reflect.
Reject distraction.
Weigh advice against the counsel of our convictions.
Deliberate without being paralyzed.
We must cultivate mental stillness to succeed in life and to
successfully navigate the many crises it throws our way.
It will not be easy. But it is essential.
For the rest of his short life, Kennedy worried that people would
learn the wrong lessons from his actions during the Missile Crisis. It
wasn’t that he had stood up to the Soviets and threatened them with
superior weapons until they backed down. Instead, calm and rational
leadership had prevailed over rasher, reckless voices. The crisis was
resolved thanks to a mastery of his own thinking, and the thinking of
those underneath him—and it was these traits that America would
need to call on repeatedly in the years to come. The lesson was one
not of force but of the power of patience, alternating confidence and
humility, foresight and presence, empathy and unbending
conviction, restraint and toughness, and quiet solitude combined
with wise counsel.

How much better would the world be with more of this behavior?
How much better would your own life be?
Kennedy, like Lincoln, was not born with this stillness. He was a
defiant troublemaker in high school, a dilettante for most of college
and even as a senator. He had his demons and he made plenty of
mistakes. But with hard work—work you are capable of doing too—
he overcame those shortcomings and developed the equanimity that
served him so well over those terrifying thirteen days. It was work in
just a few categories that nearly everyone else neglects.
Which is where we will now turn our focus—toward mastering
what we will call in this section “the domain of the mind”—because
everything we do depends on getting that right.

BECOME PRESENT

Trust no future, howe’er pleasant!
Let the dead Past bury its dead!
Act,—act in the living present!
Heart within, and God o’erhead!
—HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW

T

he decision in 2010 to title Marina Abramović’s four-decade
retrospective at MoMA in New York City The Artist Is Present all
but preordained the monumental performance that would come out
of it. Naturally, Marina would have to be present in one way or
another.
But no one would have dared think that she would literally be
there . . . for all of it.
Who could conceive that a human could sit silently in a chair,
completely still, for a total of 750 hours over 79 days directly across
from 1,545 strangers, without aid, without distraction, without so
much as a way to go to the bathroom? That she would want to do
this? That she would pull it off?
As her former lover and collaborator Ulay said when he was
asked what he thought of the possibility, “I have no thoughts. Only
respect.”
The performance was as simple as it was straightforward. Marina,
aged sixty-three, her long hair braided and over her shoulder, walked
into the cavernous room, sat down in a hard wooden chair, and
simply stared at the person across from her. One after another they

came, hour after hour, day in and day out, for nearly three months.
Each time, she looked down, gathered herself, and then looked up
afresh at the new face.
As Marina would say of her art, “The proposition here is just to
empty the self. To be able to be present.”
Is it really that hard—to be present? What’s so special about that?
No one who was in the audience, who sat across from her, would
ask such questions. For those souls lucky enough to see the
performance in person, it was a near religious experience. To
experience another person fully in the moment is a rare thing. To feel
them engage with you, to be giving all their energy to you, as though
there is nothing else that matters in the world, is rarer still. To see
them do it for so long, so intensely?
Many viewers cried. Each one said the hours in line were worth it.
It was like looking in a kind of mirror, where they could feel their
own life for the first time.
Imagine: If Marina’s mind drifted, if she daydreamed, the person
across from her could immediately sense that she was somewhere
else. If she slowed her mind and body down too much, she might
have fallen asleep. If she allowed for normal bodily sensations—
hunger, discomfort, pain, the urge to go to the bathroom—it would
be impossible not to move or get up. If she began to think of how
much time was left in the day’s performance, time would slow to an
intolerable crawl. So with monklike discipline and warriorlike
strength she ignored these distractions to exist exclusively in the
present moment. She had to be where her feet were; she had to care
about the person across from her and the experience they were
sharing more than anything else in the world.
“People don’t understand that the hardest thing is actually doing
something that is close to nothing,” Abramović said about the
performance. “It demands all of you . . . there is no object to hide
behind. It’s just you.”
Being present demands all of us. It’s not nothing. It may be the
hardest thing in the world.
As we stand on the podium, about to give a speech, our mind is
focused not on our task but on what everyone will think of us. How
does that not affect our performance? As we struggle with a crisis,

our mind repeats on a loop just how unfair this is, how insane it is
that it keeps happening and how it can’t go on. Why are we draining
ourselves of essential emotional and mental energies right when we
need them most?
Even during a quiet evening at home, all we’re thinking about is
the list of improvements that need to be made. There may be a
beautiful sunset, but instead of taking it in, we’re taking a picture of
it.
We are not present . . . and so we miss out. On life. On being our
best. On seeing what’s there.
Many of the people in line to see Marina Abramović’s
performance accidentally illustrate this phenomenon. Rushing in as
the doors opened, they zoomed past equally impressive pieces from
her career so that they could be first for the “special” one. In line,
they fidgeted endlessly and chatted with each other, trying to kill
time as the hours ticked by. They napped, leaning up against one
another. They checked their phones . . . and then checked them
again. They planned what they would do when it was their turn and
speculated about what it would be like. Some of them worked in
secret on little stunts they hoped would bring them fifteen seconds of
fame.
How much ordinary wonderfulness they closed their minds to.
It makes you wonder: After they had their transcendent
experience with Marina—coming face-to-face with real presence—
when they left the museum and walked out into the busy New York
City street, did they breathe in anew the vibrant rhythm of the urban
jungle, or, more likely, did they immediately resume their busy lives,
full of distractions, anxiety, dreams, insecurities, and ego?
In short, did they do exactly what all of us do most of every single
day?
We do not live in this moment. We, in fact, try desperately to get
out of it—by thinking, doing, talking, worrying, remembering,
hoping, whatever. We pay thousands of dollars to have a device in
our pocket to ensure that we are never bored. We sign up for endless
activities and obligations, chase money and accomplishments, all
with the naïve belief that at the end of it will be happiness.

Tolstoy observed that love can’t exist off in the future. Love is
only real if it’s happening right now. If you think about it, that’s true
for basically everything we think, feel, or do. The best athletes, in the
biggest games, are completely there. They are within themselves,
within the now.
Remember, there’s no greatness in the future. Or clarity. Or
insight. Or happiness. Or peace. There is only this moment.
Not that we mean literally sixty seconds. The real present
moment is what we choose to exist in, instead of lingering on the past
or fretting about the future. It’s however long we can push away the
impressions of what’s happened before and what we worry or hope
might occur at some other time. Right now can be a few minutes or a
morning or a year—if you can stay in it that long.
As Laura Ingalls Wilder said, now is now. It can never be
anything else.
Seize it!
Who is so talented that they can afford to bring only part of
themselves to bear on a problem or opportunity? Whose
relationships are so strong that they can get away with not showing
up? Who is so certain that they’ll get another moment that they can
confidently skip over this one? The less energy we waste regretting
the past or worrying about the future, the more energy we will have
for what’s in front of us.
We want to learn to see the world like an artist: While other
people are oblivious to what surrounds them, the artist really sees.
Their mind, fully engaged, notices the way a bird flies or the way a
stranger holds their fork or a mother looks at her child. They have no
thoughts of the morrow. All they are thinking about is how to capture
and communicate this experience.
An artist is present. And from this stillness comes brilliance.
This moment we are experiencing right now is a gift (that’s why
we call it the present). Even if it is a stressful, trying experience—it
could be our last. So let’s develop the ability to be in it, to put
everything we have into appreciating the plentitude of the now.
Don’t reject a difficult or boring moment because it is not exactly
what you want. Don’t waste a beautiful moment because you are
insecure or shy. Make what you can of what you have been given.

Live what can be lived. That’s what excellence is. That’s what
presence makes possible.
In meditation, teachers instruct students to focus on their breath.
In and out. In and out. In sports, coaches speak about “the
process”—this play, this drill, this rep. Not just because this moment
is special, but because you can’t do your best if your mind is
elsewhere.
We would do well to follow this in our own lives. Jesus told his
disciples not to worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will take
care of itself. Another way of saying that is: You have plenty on your
plate right now. Focus on that, no matter how small or insignificant
it is. Do the very best you can right now.Don’t think about what
detractors may say. Don’t dwell or needlessly complicate. Be here. Be
all of you.
Be present.
And if you’ve had trouble with this in the past? That’s okay.
That’s the nice thing about the present. It keeps showing up to
give you a second chance.

LIMIT YOUR INPUTS

A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.
—HERBERT SIMON

A

s a general, Napoleon made it his habit to delay responding to
the mail. His secretary was instructed to wait three weeks before
opening any correspondence. When he finally did hear what was in a
letter, Napoleon loved to note how many supposedly “important”
issues had simply resolved themselves and no longer required a
reply.
While Napoleon was certainly an eccentric leader, he was never
negligent in his duties or out of touch with his government or his
soldiers. But in order to be active and aware of what actually
mattered, he had to be selective about who and what kind of
information got access to his brain.
In a similar vein, he told messengers never to wake him with
good news. Bad news, on the other hand—that is to say, an unfolding
crisis or an urgent development that negatively impacted his
campaign—was to be brought to him immediately. “Rouse me
instantly,” he said, “for then there is not a moment to be lost.”
These were both brilliant accommodations to the reality of life for
a busy person: There is way too much coming at us. In order to think
clearly, it is essential that each of us figures out how to filter out the
inconsequential from the essential. It’s not enough to be inclined
toward deep thought and sober analysis; a leader must create time
and space for it.

In the modern world, this is not easy. In the 1990s, political
scientists began to study what they called the “CNN Effect.”
Breathless, twenty-four-hour media coverage makes it considerably
harder for politicians and CEOs to be anything but reactive. There’s
too much information, every trivial detail is magnified under the
microscope, speculation is rampant—and the mind is overwhelmed.
The CNN Effect is now a problem for everyone, not just
presidents and generals. Each of us has access to more information
than we could ever reasonably use. We tell ourselves that it’s part of
our job, that we have to be “on top of things,” and so we give up
precious time to news, reports, meetings, and other forms of
feedback. Even if we’re not glued to a television, we’re still
surrounded by gossip and drama and other distractions.
We must stop this.
“If you wish to improve,” Epictetus once said, “be content to
appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.”
Napoleon was content with being behind on his mail, even if it
upset some people or if he missed out on some gossip, because it
meant that trivial problems had to resolve themselves without him.
We need to cultivate a similar attitude—give things a little space,
don’t consume news in real time, be a season or two behind on the
latest trend or cultural phenomenon, don’t let your inbox lord over
your life.
The important stuff will still be important by the time you get to
it. The unimportant will have made its insignificance obvious (or
simply disappeared). Then, with stillness rather than needless
urgency or exhaustion, you will be able to sit down and give what
deserves consideration your full attention.
There is ego in trying to stay up on everything, whether it’s an
acclaimed television show, the newest industry rumor, the smartest
hot take, or the hottest crisis in [the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the
climate, the World Bank, the NATO Summit, ad infinitum]. There is
ego in trying to appear the most informed person in the room, the
one with all the gossip, who knows every single thing that’s
happening in everyone’s life.
Not only does this cost us our peace of mind, but there’s a serious
opportunity cost too. If we were stiller, more confident, had the

longer view, what truly meaningful subject could we dedicate our
mental energy to?
In her diary in 1942, Dorothy Day, the Catholic nun and social
activist, admonished herself much the same. “Turn off your radio,”
she wrote, “put away your daily paper. Read one review of events and
spend time reading.” Books, spend time reading books—that’s what
she meant. Books full of wisdom.
Though this too can be overdone.
The verse from John Ferriar:
What wild desires, what restless torments seize
The hapless man, who feels the book-disease.
The point is, it’s very difficult to think or act clearly (to say
nothing of being happy) when we are drowning in information. It’s
why lawyers attempt to bury the other side in paper. It’s why
intelligence operatives flood the enemy with propaganda, so they’ll
lose the scent of the truth. It’s not a coincidence that the goal of these
tactics is casually referred to as analysis paralysis.
Yet we do this to ourselves!
A century and a half after Napoleon, another great general and,
later, head of state, Dwight D. Eisenhower, struggled to manage the
torrent of facts and fiction that was thrown at him. His solution was
strict adherence to the chain of command when it came to
information. No one was to hand him unopened mail, no one was to
just throw half-explored problems at him. Too much depended on
the stillness within that he needed to operate to allow such
haphazard information flow. One of his innovations was to organize
information and problems into what’s now called the “Eisenhower
Box,” a matrix that orders our priorities by their ratio of urgency and
importance.
Much that was happening in the world or on the job, Eisenhower
found, was urgent but not important. Meanwhile, most of what was
truly important was not remotely time-sensitive. Categorizing his
inputs helped him organize his staff around what was important
versus what seemed urgent, allowed them to be strategic rather than

reactive, a mile deep on what mattered rather than an inch on too
many things.
Indeed, the first thing great chiefs of staff do—whether it’s for a
general or a president or the CEO of a local bank—is limit the
amount of people who have access to the boss. They become
gatekeepers: no more drop-ins, tidbits, and stray reports. So the boss
can see the big picture. So the boss has time and room to think.
Because if the boss doesn’t? Well, then nobody can.
In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius says, “Ask yourself at every
moment, ‘Is this necessary?’”
Knowing what not to think about. What to ignore and not to do.
It’s your first and most important job.
Thich Nhat Hanh:
Before we can make deep changes in our lives, we have to
look into our diet, our way of consuming. We have to live
in such a way that we stop consuming the things that
poison us and intoxicate us. Then we will have the strength
to allow the best in us to arise, and we will no longer be
victims of anger, of frustration.
It’s as true of food as it is of information.
There’s a great saying: Garbage in, garbage out. If you want good
output, you have to watch over the inputs.
This will take discipline. It will not be easy.
This means fewer alerts and notifications. It means blocking
incoming texts with the Do Not Disturb function and funneling
emails to subfolders. It means questioning that “open door” policy,
or even where you live. It means pushing away selfish people who
bring needless drama into our lives. It means studying the world
more philosophically—that is, with a long-term perspective—rather
than following events second by second.
The way you feel when you awake early in the morning and your
mind is fresh and as yet unsoiled by the noise of the outside world—
that’s space worth protecting. So too is the zone you lock into when
you’re really working well. Don’t let intrusions bounce you out of it.

Put up barriers. Put up the proper chuting to direct what’s urgent
and unimportant to the right people.
Walker Percy, one of the last great southern novelists, has a
powerful passage in Lancelot, based on Percy’s own struggle with
idleness and addiction to entertainment. In the book, the harried
narrator walks outside of his Mississippi mansion and, for the first
time in years, simply stops. He steps outside his bubble and
experiences the moment. “Can a man stand alone, naked, and at his
ease, wrist flexed at his side like Michelangelo’s David, without
assistance, without diversion . . . in silence?” he asks.
Yes. It was possible to stand. Nothing happened. I
listened. There was no sound: no boats on the river, no
trucks on the road, not even cicadas. What if I didn’t listen
to the news? I didn’t. Nothing happened. I realized I had
been afraid of the silence.
It is in this stillness that we can be present and finally see truth. It
is in this stillness that we can hear the voice inside us.
How different would the world look if people spent as much time
listening to their conscience as they did to chattering broadcasts? If
they could respond to the calls of their convictions as quickly as we
answer the dings and rings of technology in our pockets?
All this noise. All this information. All these inputs.
We are afraid of the silence. We are afraid of looking stupid. We
are afraid of missing out. We are afraid of being the bad guy who
says, “Nope, not interested.”
We’d rather make ourselves miserable than make ourselves a
priority, than be our best selves.
Than be still . . . and in charge of our own information diet.

EMPTY THE MIND

To become empty is to become one with the divine—
this is the Way.
—AWA KENZO

S

hawn Green began his third season with the Los Angeles Dodgers
in 2002 in the worst slump of his Major League Baseball career.
The media was out for blood, and so were the fans, who booed him at
the plate. Dodgers management began to doubt him too. The man
was making $14 million a year and he could not hit.
After weeks of intense hitting famine, would he be benched?
Traded? Sent down to the minors?
All this was racing through Green’s mind, as it would race
through the mind of anyone struggling at work. That little voice:
What’s wrong with you? Why can’t you get this right? Did you lose
your touch?
Hitting a baseball is already a nearly inconceivable feat. It
requires the batter to see, process, decide, swing at, and connect with
a tiny ball traveling at speeds north of 90 miles per hour from an
elevated position sixty feet away. Four hundred milliseconds. That’s
how long it takes for the ball to travel from the mound to the batter.
To be able to swing and hit it literally defies physics—it’s the single
hardest act in all of sports.
The anxiety and doubts in a slump make it even harder. Yogi
Berra’s warning: “It’s impossible to hit and think at the same time.”

For Green, the ball began to look smaller and smaller the longer
he went without a hit. But it was Buddhism, which he had long
practiced, that Shawn leaned on to prevent this vicious cycle from
destroying his career. Instead of giving in to those churning thoughts
—instead of trying harder and harder—he tried to clear his mind
entirely. Instead of fighting the slump, he was going to try not to
think about it at all.
It seems crazy, but it isn’t. “Man is a thinking reed,” D. T. Suzuki,
one of the early popularizers of Buddhism in the West, once said,
“but his great works are done when he is not calculating and
thinking. ‘Childlikeness’ has to be restored with long years of training
in the art of self-forgetfulness. When this is attained, man thinks yet
he does not think.”
The way out of the slump wasn’t to consult experts or redesign his
swing. Shawn Green knew he had to get rid of the toxic thinking that
had knocked him off his game in the first place—the thinking about
his big contract, the expectations for how he wanted the season to go,
the stress at home, or the critics in the media.
He had to push all that out of his mind. He had to let his training
take over.
On May 23, 2002, Green was struggling to do exactly that. It was
the rubber match in a series against the Brewers. The Dodgers had
eked out a 1–0 victory the night before, and lost the night before that.
Green’s own hitting was sporadic and discouraging. So when he got
to the ballpark that morning, he worked to give himself a fresh start.
First in the batting cage, and then at the batting tee, he slowly,
patiently, quietly cleared his mind. With each swing, he tried to focus
on the mechanics, the placement of his feet, really planting himself
where his feet were—not thinking of the past, not worrying about
what was coming in the future, not thinking about the fans or how he
wanted to hit the ball. Really, he wasn’t thinking at all. Instead, he
repeated an old Zen proverb to himself: Chop wood, carry water.
Chop wood, carry water. Chop wood, carry water.
Don’t overanalyze. Do the work.
Don’t think. Hit.
In his first at bat on that day, Green took two strikes in the first
two pitches. His mind burbled a bit—Is the slump going to keep

going, is this ever going to end, why can’t I get this right?—but he
let those wild horses run right on by, waiting for the dust they kicked
up to settle. He breathed in, emptied his mind again—as empty as
the seats in the stadium during his pregame ritual.
Then he got back to work. On the third pitch—CRACK! A solid
double down the right-field line.
In the second inning, Green got an inside fastball. He planted his
front foot and focused only on that, on the feeling of being nailed to
the ground. He watched the pitch, and swung. The ball was soon
going back out the other direction, high up over the right-field wall.
Three runs came in along with it. In the fourth inning, he hit another
homer up in the walkway over right-center field. In the fifth inning,
he hit a home run deep into left field. Opposite field, a sign that a
hitter is really starting to dial in. In the eighth inning, he hit a long
single.
The slump was no more.
Five for five in his at bats, and the manager wanted to send him
home for the day. Green asked for another at bat.
Now his mind was tempted to race in a different direction, his
brain filled with congratulations instead of doubts. You’re killing it.
How exciting is this? Are you going to get another hit? You could set
a record!
Just like the overactive voice in a slump, the voice in a streak is an
equally deleterious racing mental loop. Both get in the way. Both
make a hard thing harder.
As Shawn Green stepped into the batter’s box for the sixth and
final time, he said to himself, “There’s no sense in thinking now.” He
cleared his mind, and enjoyed himself like a kid at a Little League
game.
No pressure. Just presence. Just happy to be there.
On the third pitch, he got a dipping cutter that sank low and
inside, below knee level. For lefties, like Green, when they are in a
slump, that area of the hitting zone is like a black hole. When they’re
locked in, it’s the wheelhouse. Green connected, with a swing that
even one of the coaches said looked like it was happening in slow
motion. Every part of the batter was behind the bat, mentally and
physically—and the ball was launched deep, deep into right-center

field. He hit it a mile. It slammed high off the back wall of the
enclosed stadium and bounced back onto the field.
As Green’s teammates went nuts in the dugout, he kept his head
down and rounded the bases with the same calm, deliberate trot as in
his previous three home runs. You couldn’t tell from the lack of
celebrating, but he was in that moment only the fourteenth player in
history ever to hit four home runs in a single game. Six for six, with
nineteen total bases and seven runs batted in, perhaps the single
greatest one-game performance in baseball. The entire crowd of
26,728 people—at an away game—rose for a standing ovation. But
Green was already clearing that all away, and coming back to his
routine. He took off his batting gloves and swept the experience from
his mind, keeping it empty to use in the next game.*
Shawn Green is hardly the first Buddhist baseball player.
Sadaharu Oh, the greatest home run hitter in the history of baseball,
was one too. The goal of Zen, his master taught him, was to “achieve
a void . . . noiseless, colorless, heatless void”—to get to that state of
emptiness, whether it was on the mound or in the batter’s box or at
practice.
Before that, Zhuang Zhou, the Chinese philosopher, said, “Tao is
in the emptiness. Emptiness is the fast of the mind.” Marcus Aurelius
once wrote about “cutting free of impressions that cling to the mind,
free of the future and the past,” to become the “sphere rejoicing in its
perfect stillness.” But if you saw those words in the first paragraph of
the write-up for the Dodgers-Brewers game in the Los Angeles Times
the next day, they would have made perfect sense. Epictetus,
Marcus’s philosophical predecessor, was in fact speaking about
sports when he said, “If we’re anxious or nervous when we make the
catch or throw, what will become of the game, and how can one
maintain one’s composure; how can one see what is coming next?”
As is true in athletics, so too in life.
Yes, thinking is essential. Expert knowledge is undoubtedly key to
the success of any leader or athlete or artist. The problem is that,
unthinkingly, we think too much. The “wild and whirling words” of
our subconscious get going and suddenly there’s no room for our
training (or anything else). We’re overloaded, overwhelmed, and
distracted . . . by our own mind!

But if we can clear space, if we can consciously empty our mind,
as Green did, insights and breakthroughs happen. The perfect swing
connects perfectly with the ball.
There is a beautiful paradox to this idea of void.
The Daodejing points out that when clay is formed around
emptiness, it becomes a pitcher that can hold water. Water from the
pitcher is poured into a cup, which is itself formed around emptiness.
The room this all happens in is itself four walls formed around
emptiness.
Do you see? By relying on what’s not there, we actually have
something worth using. During the recording of her album Interiors,
the musician Rosanne Cash posted a simple sign over the doorway of
the studio. “Abandon Thought, All Ye Who Enter Here.” Not because
she wanted a bunch of unthinking idiots working with her, but
because she wanted everyone involved—included herself—to go
deeper than whatever was on the surface of their minds. She wanted
them to be present, connected to the music, and not lost in their
heads.
Imagine if Kennedy had spent the Cuban Missile Crisis obsessing
over the Bay of Pigs. Imagine if Shawn Green had tried frantically to
re-create his swing because it wasn’t working, or if he had faced
those pitchers with a racing mind, filled with insecurities and
desperation. We’ve all experienced that—Don’t mess up. Don’t mess
up. Don’t forget, we say to ourselves—and what happens? We do
exactly what we were trying not to do!
Whatever you face, whatever you’re doing will require, first and
foremost, that you don’t defeat yourself. That you don’t make it
harder by overthinking, by needless doubts, or by second-guessing.
That space between your ears—that’s yours. You don’t just have
to control what gets in, you also have to control what goes on in
there. You have to protect it from yourself, from your own thoughts.
Not with sheer force, but rather with a kind of gentle, persistent
sweeping. Be the librarian who says “Shhh!” to the rowdy kids, or
tells the jerk on his phone to please take it outside.
Because the mind is an important and sacred place.
Keep it clean and clear.

SLOW DOWN, THINK DEEPLY

With my sighted eye I see what’s before me, and with
my unsighted eye I see what’s hidden.

I

n the intro sequence of the beloved children’s show Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood, the first interior shot does not show the host.
Instead, in the beat before Fred Rogers appears on the screen singing
his cheerful song about being a good neighbor, viewers see a traffic
light, blinking yellow.
For more than thirty years and for nearly a thousand episodes,
this subtle piece of symbolism opened the show. If as a hint, it went
over the heads of most people watching, viewers were still primed to
get the message. Because whether Fred Rogers was speaking on
camera, playing in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe with King
Friday the Puppet, or singing one of his trademark songs, just about
every frame of the show seemed to say: Slow down. Be considerate.
Be aware.
As a child at Latrobe Elementary School in Pennsylvania, Fred
Rogers had been a victim of vicious bullying. Kids picked on him
because of his weight and because he was sensitive about it. It was a
horrible experience, but this pain spurred his groundbreaking work
in public television. “I began a lifelong search for what is essential,”
he said about his childhood, “what it is about my neighbor that
doesn’t meet the eye.” He even framed a print of that idea on the wall

of his production studio in Pittsburgh, a snippet from one of his
favorite quotes: L’essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.
What’s essential is invisible to the eye.
That is: Appearances are misleading. First impressions are too.
We are disturbed and deceived by what’s on the surface, by what
others see. Then we make bad decisions, miss opportunities, or feel
scared or upset. Particularly when we don’t slow down and take the
time to really look.
Think about Khrushchev on the other side of the Cuban Missile
Crisis. What provoked his incredible overreach? A poor reading of
his opponent’s mettle. A rush to action. Shoddy thinking about how
his own actions would be interpreted on the world stage. It was a
nearly fatal miscalculation, as most rush jobs are.
Epictetus talked about how the job of a philosopher is to take our
impressions—what we see, hear, and think—and put them to the test.
He said we needed to hold up our thoughts and examine them, to
make sure we weren’t being led astray by appearances or missing
what couldn’t be seen by the naked eye.
Indeed, it is in Stoicism and Buddhism and countless other
schools that we find the same analogy: The world is like muddy
water. To see through it, we have to let things settle. We can’t be
disturbed by initial appearances, and if we are patient and still, the
truth will be revealed to us.
That’s what Mr. Rogers taught children to do—starting a crucial
habit as early as possible in their lives. In countless episodes, Rogers
would take a topic—whether it was self-worth or how crayons were
made, divorce or having fun—and walk his young viewers through
what was really happening and what it meant. He seemed to
naturally know how a kid’s mind would process information, and
he’d help them clear up understandable confusion or fears. He
taught empathy and critical reasoning skills. He reassured his
viewers that they could figure just about anything out if they took the
time to work through it—with him, together.
It’s a message he shared with adults too. “Just think,” Rogers
once wrote to a struggling friend. “Just be quiet and think. It’ll make
all the difference in the world.”

There is, on the surface, a contradiction here. On the one hand,
the Buddhists say we must empty our minds to be fully present. We’ll
never get anything done if we are paralyzed by overthinking. On the
other hand, we must look and think and study deeply if we are ever
to truly know (and if we are to avoid falling into the destructive
patterns that harm so many people).
In fact, this is not a contradiction at all. It’s just life.
We have to get better at thinking, deliberately and intentionally,
about the big questions. On the complicated things. On
understanding what’s really going on with a person, or a situation, or
with life itself.
We have to do the kind of thinking that 99 percent of the
population is just not doing, and we have to stop doing the
destructive thinking that they spend 99 percent of their time doing.
The eighteenth-century Zen master Hakuin was highly critical of
teachers who believed that enlightenment was simply a matter of
thinking nothing. Instead, he wanted his students to think really,
really hard. This is why he assigned them perplexing kōans like
“What is the sound of one hand clapping?” and “What did your face
look like before you were born?” and “Does the dog have the Buddha
nature?”
These questions defy easy answers, and that’s the point. By taking
the time to meditate on them deeply, in some cases for days and
weeks or even years, students put their mind in such a clarified state
that deeper truths emerge, and enlightenment commences (and even
if they don’t get all the way there, they are stronger for having tried).
“Suddenly,” Hakuin promised his students, “unexpectedly your
teeth sink in. Your body will pour with cold sweat. At the instant, it
will all become clear.” The word for this was satori—an illuminating
insight when the inscrutable is revealed, when an essential truth
becomes obvious and inescapable.
Couldn’t we all use a bit more of that?
Well, no one gets to satori going a million miles a minute. No one
gets there by focusing on what’s obvious, or by sticking with the first
thought that pops into their head. To see what matters, you really
have to look. To understand it, you have to really think. It takes real
work to grasp what is invisible to just about everyone else.

This will not only be advantageous to your career and your
business, but it will also help you find peace and comfort.
There is another great insight from Fred Rogers, which now goes
viral each time there is another unspeakable tragedy. “Always look
for the helpers,” he explained to his viewers who were scared or
disillusioned by the news. “There’s always someone who is trying to
help. . . . The world is full of doctors and nurses, police and firemen,
volunteers, neighbors and friends who are ready to jump in to help
when things go wrong.”
Make no mistake—this was not some glib reassurance. Rogers,
building on advice from his own mother when he was a child, had
managed to find comfort and goodness inside an event that would
provoke only pain and anger and fear in other people. And he figured
out how to communicate it in a way that continues to make the world
a better place long after his death.
So much of the distress we feel comes from reacting instinctually
instead of acting with conscientious deliberation. So much of what
we get wrong comes from the same place. We’re reacting to shadows.
We’re taking as certainties impressions we have yet to test. We’re not
stopping to put on our glasses and really look.
Your job, after you have emptied your mind, is to slow down and
think. To really think, on a regular basis.
. . . Think about what’s important to you.
. . . Think about what’s actually going on.
. . . Think about what might be hidden from view.
. . . Think about what the rest of the chessboard looks like.
. . . Think about what the meaning of life really is.
The choreographer Twyla Tharp provides an exercise for us to
follow:
Sit alone in a room and let your thoughts go wherever they
will. Do this for one minute. . . . Work up to ten minutes a
day of this mindless mental wandering. Then start paying
attention to your thoughts to see if a word or goal

materializes. If it doesn’t, extend the exercise to eleven
minutes, then twelve, then thirteen . . . until you find the
length of time you need to ensure that something
interesting will come to mind. The Gaelic phrase for this
state of mind is “quietness without loneliness.”
If you invest the time and mental energy, you’ll not only find
what’s interesting (or your next creative project), you’ll find truth.
You’ll find what other people have missed. You’ll find solutions to the
problems we face—whether it’s insight to the logic of the Soviets and
their missiles in Cuba, or how to move your business forward, or how
to make sense of senseless violence.
These are answers that must be fished from the depths. And what
is fishing but slowing down? Being both relaxed and highly attuned
to your environment? And ultimately, catching hold of what lurks
below the surface and reeling it in?

START JOURNALING

Keep a notebook. Travel with it, eat with it, sleep with
it. Slap into it every stray thought that flutters up into
your brain.
—JACK LONDON

F

or her thirteenth birthday, a precocious German refugee named
Anne Frank was given a small red-and-white “autograph book”
by her parents. Although the pages were designed to collect the
signatures and memories of friends, she knew from the moment she
first saw it in a store window that she would use it as a journal. As
Anne wrote in her first entry on June 12, 1942, “I hope I will be able
to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in
anyone, and I hope you’ll be a great source of comfort and support.”
No one could have anticipated just how much comfort and
support she’d need. Twenty-four days after that first entry, Anne and
her Jewish family were forced into hiding, in the cramped attic annex
over her father’s warehouse in Amsterdam. It’s where they would
spend the next two years, hoping the Nazis would not discover them.
Anne Frank had wanted a diary for understandable reasons. She
was a teenager. She had been lonely, scared, and bored before, but
now she was cooped up in a set of cramped, suffocating rooms with
six other people. It was all so overwhelming, all so unfair and
unfamiliar. She needed somewhere to put those feelings.
According to her father, Otto, Anne didn’t write every day, but
she always wrote when she was upset or dealing with a problem. She

also wrote when she was confused, when she was curious. She wrote
in that journal as a form of therapy, so as not to unload her troubled
thoughts on the family and compatriots with whom she shared such
unenviable conditions. One of her best and most insightful lines
must have come on a particularly difficult day. “Paper,” she said,
“has more patience than people.”
Anne used her journal to reflect. “How noble and good everyone
could be,” she wrote, “if at the end of the day they were to review
their own behavior and weigh up the rights and wrongs. They would
automatically try to do better at the start of each new day, and after a
while, would certainly accomplish a great deal.” She observed that
writing allowed her to watch herself as if she were a stranger. At a
time when hormones usually make teenagers more selfish, she
regularly reviewed her writings to challenge and improve her own
thinking. Even with death lurking outside the doors, she worked to
make herself a better person.
The list of people, ancient and modern, who practiced the art of
journaling is almost comically long and fascinatingly diverse. Among
them: Oscar Wilde, Susan Sontag, Marcus Aurelius, Queen Victoria,
John Quincy Adams, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Virginia Woolf, Joan
Didion, Shawn Green, Mary Chesnut, Brian Koppelman, Anaïs Nin,
Franz Kafka, Martina Navratilova, and Ben Franklin.
All journalers.
Some did it in the morning. Some did it sporadically. Some, like
Leonardo da Vinci, kept their notebooks on their person at all times.
John F. Kennedy kept a diary during his travels before World War II,
and then as president was more of a notetaker and a doodler (which
is shown in studies to improve memory) on White House stationery
both to clarify his thinking and to keep a record of it.
Obviously this is an intimidating list of individuals. But Anne
Frank was thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen years old. If she can do it,
what excuse do we have?
Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, seems to have done his writing and
reflection in the evenings, much along the lines of Anne Frank’s
practice. When darkness had fallen and his wife had gone to sleep, he
explained to a friend, “I examine my entire day and go back over
what I’ve done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing

by.” Then he would go to bed, finding that “the sleep which follows
this self-examination” was particularly sweet. Anyone who reads him
today can feel him reaching for stillness in these nightly writings.
Michel Foucault talked of the ancient genre of hupomnemata
(notes to oneself). He called the journal a “weapon for spiritual
combat,” a way to practice philosophy and purge the mind of
agitation and foolishness and to overcome difficulty. To silence the
barking dogs in your head. To prepare for the day ahead. To reflect
on the day that has passed. Take note of insights you’ve heard. Take
the time to feel wisdom flow through your fingertips and onto the
page.
This is what the best journals look like. They aren’t for the reader.
They are for the writer. To slow the mind down. To wage peace with
oneself.
Journaling is a way to ask tough questions: Where am I standing
in my own way? What’s the smallest step I can take toward a big
thing today? Why am I so worked up about this? What blessings can
I count right now? Why do I care so much about impressing people?
What is the harder choice I’m avoiding? Do I rule my fears, or do
they rule me? How will today’s difficulties reveal my character?*
While there are plenty of people who will anecdotally swear to the
benefits of journaling, the research is compelling too. According to
one study, journaling helps improve well-being after traumatic and
stressful events. Similarly, a University of Arizona study showed that
people were able to better recover from divorce and move forward if
they journaled on the experience. Keeping a journal is a common
recommendation from psychologists as well, because it helps
patients stop obsessing and allows them to make sense of the many
inputs—emotional, external, psychological—that would otherwise
overwhelm them.
That’s really the idea. Instead of carrying that baggage around in
our heads or hearts, we put it down on paper. Instead of letting
racing thoughts run unchecked or leaving half-baked assumptions
unquestioned, we force ourselves to write and examine them. Putting
your own thinking down on paper lets you see it from a distance. It
gives you objectivity that is so often missing when anxiety and fears
and frustrations flood your mind.

What’s the best way to start journaling? Is there an ideal time of
day? How long should it take?
Who cares?
How you journal is much less important than why you are doing
it: To get something off your chest. To have quiet time with your
thoughts. To clarify those thoughts. To separate the harmful from the
insightful.
There’s no right way or wrong way. The point is just to do it.
If you’ve started before and stopped, start again. Getting out of
the rhythm happens. The key is to carve out the space again, today.
The French painter Eugène Delacroix—who called Stoicism his
consoling religion—struggled as we struggle:
I am taking up my Journal again after a long break. I think
it may be a way of calming this nervous excitement that
has been worrying me for so long.
Yes!
That is what journaling is about. It’s spiritual windshield wipers,
as the writer Julia Cameron once put it. It’s a few minutes of
reflection that both demands and creates stillness. It’s a break from
the world. A framework for the day ahead. A coping mechanism for
troubles of the hours just past. A revving up of your creative juices,
for relaxing and clearing.
Once, twice, three times a day. Whatever. Find what works for
you.
Just know that it may turn out to be the most important thing you
do all day.

CULTIVATE SILENCE

All profound things, and emotions of things are
preceded and attended by Silence. . . . Silence is the
general consecration of the universe.
—HERMAN MELVILLE

T

he fascination with silence began early in life for the composer
John Cage. In 1928, in a speech contest for Los Angeles High
School, he tried to persuade his fellow students and the judges that
America should institute a national day of quiet. By observing
silence, he told the audience, they would finally be able to “hear what
other people think.”
It was the beginning of Cage’s lifelong exploration and
experimentation with what it means to be quiet and the
opportunities for listening that this disciplined silence creates.
Cage wandered after high school. He toured Europe. He studied
painting. He taught music. He composed classical music. He was an
avid observer. Born in 1915 in California, he was just old enough to
remember what premechanized life was like, and as the century
became modern—and technology remade every industry and
occupation—he began to notice just how loud everything had
become.
“Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise,” he would say.
“When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it
fascinating.”

To Cage, silence was not necessarily the absence of all sound. He
loved the sound of a truck at 50 miles an hour. Static on the radio.
The hum of an amplifier. The sound of water on water. Most of all, he
appreciated the sounds that were missed or overwhelmed by our
noisy lives.
In 1951, he visited an anechoic chamber, the most advanced
soundproof room in the world at the time. Even there, with his highly
sensitive musician’s ear, he heard sounds. Two sounds, one high and
one low. Speaking with the engineer afterward, he was amazed to
discover that the source of those sounds was his own nervous system
and the pumping of his blood.
How many of us have ever come close to this kind of quiet?
Reducing the noise and chatter around you to the degree that you
can literally hear your own life? Can you imagine? What you could do
with that much silence!
It was a reaction against unnecessary noise that inspired Cage’s
most famous creation, 4′33″ , which was originally conceived with
the title Silent Prayer. Cage wanted to create a song identical to the
popular music of the day—it’d be the same length, it’d be performed
live and played on the radio like every other song. The only
difference was that 4′33″ would be a “piece of uninterrupted
silence.”
Some people saw this as an absurd joke, a Duchampian send-up
of what constitutes “music.” In one sense, it was. (Cage thought it
would be funny to sell the “song” to Muzak Co. to be played in
elevators.) But it was also inspired by his lifelong study of Zen
philosophy, a philosophy that finds fullness in emptiness. The
performance instructions for the song are themselves a beautiful
contradiction: “In a situation provided with maximum amplification,
perform a disciplined action.”
In fact, 4′33″ was never about achieving perfect silence—it’s
about what happens when you stop contributing to the noise. The
song was first performed at Woodstock, New York, by the pianist
David Tudor.* “There’s no such thing as silence,” Cage said of that
first performance. “What they thought was silence, because they
didn’t know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds. You could
hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the

second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third the
people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked
or walked out.”
We were given two ears and only one mouth for a reason, the
philosopher Zeno observed. What you’ll notice when you stop to
listen can make all the difference in the world.
Too much of our lives is defined by noise. Headphones go in
(noise-canceling headphones so that we can better hear . . . noise).
Screens on. Phones ringing. The quiet metal womb of a jumbo jet,
traveling at 600 miles per hour, is filled with nothing but people
trying to avoid silence. They’d rather watch the same bad movies
again and again, or listen to some inane interview with an annoying
celebrity, than stop and absorb what’s happening around them.
They’d rather close their mind than sit there and have to use it.
“Thought will not work except in silence,” Thomas Carlyle said. If
we want to think better, we need to seize these moments of quiet. If
we want more revelations—more insights or breakthroughs or new,
big ideas—we have to create more room for them. We have to step
away from the comfort of noisy distractions and stimulations. We
have to start listening.
In downtown Helsinki, there is a small building called the
Kamppi Chapel. It’s not a place of worship, strictly speaking, but it’s
as quiet as any cathedral. Quieter, in fact, because there are no
echoes. No organs. No enormous creaking doors. It is, in fact, a
Church of Silence. It’s open to anyone and everyone who is interested
in a moment of quiet spirituality in a busy city.
You walk in and there is just silence.
Glorious, sacred silence. The kind of silence that lets you really
start hearing.
Randall Stutman, who for decades has been the behind-thescenes advisor for many of the biggest CEOs and leaders on Wall
Street, once studied how several hundred senior executives of major
corporations recharged in their downtime. The answers were things
like sailing, long-distance cycling, listening quietly to classical music,
scuba diving, riding motorcycles, and fly-fishing. All these activities,
he noticed, had one thing in common: an absence of voices.

These were people with busy, collaborative professions. People
who made countless high-stakes decisions in the course of a day. But
a couple hours without chatter, without other people in their ear,
where they could simply think (or not think), they could recharge
and find peace. They could be still—even if they were moving. They
could finally hear, even if over the sounds of a roaring river or the
music of Vivaldi.
Each of us needs to cultivate those moments in our lives. Where
we limit our inputs and turn down the volume so that we can access a
deeper awareness of what’s going on around us. In shutting up—even
if only for a short period—we can finally hear what the world has
been trying to tell us. Or what we’ve been trying to tell ourselves.
That quiet is so rare is a sign of its value. Seize it.
We can’t be afraid of silence, as it has much to teach us. Seek it.
The ticking of the hands of your watch is telling you how time is
passing away, never to return. Listen to it.

SEEK WISDOM

Imperturbable wisdom is worth everything.
—DEMOCRITUS

I

n Greece in 426 BC, the priestess of Delphi answered a question
posed to her by a citizen of Athens: Was there anyone wiser than
Socrates?
Her answer: No.
This idea that Socrates could be the wisest of them all was a
surprise, to Socrates especially.
Unlike traditionally wise people who knew many things, and
unlike pretentious people who claimed to know many things,
Socrates was intellectually humble. In fact, he spent most of his life
sincerely proclaiming his lack of wisdom.
Yet this was the secret to his brilliance, the reason he has stood
apart for centuries as a model of wisdom. Six hundred years after
Socrates’s death, Diogenes Laërtius would write that what made
Socrates so wise was that “he knew nothing except just the fact of his
ignorance.” Better still, he was aware of what he did not know and
was always willing to be proven wrong.
Indeed, the core of what we now call the Socratic method comes
from Socrates’s real and often annoying habit of going around asking
questions. He was constantly probing other people’s views. Why do
you think that? How do you know? What evidence do you have? But
what about this or that?

This open-minded search for truth, for wisdom, was what made
Socrates the most brilliant and challenging man in Athens—so much
so that they later killed him for it.
All philosophical schools preach the need for wisdom. The
Hebrew word for wisdom is
(chokmâh); the corresponding
term in Islam is ḥikma, and both cultures believe that God was an
endless source of it. The Greek word for wisdom was sophia, which
in Latin became sapientia (and why man is called Homo sapiens).
Both the Epicureans and the Stoics held sophia up as a core tenet. In
their view, wisdom was gained through experience and study. Jesus
advised his followers to be as wise as snakes and as innocent as
doves. Proverbs 4:7 holds acquiring wisdom to be the most
important thing people can do.
The Buddhists refer to wisdom as prajñā, and took wisdom to
mean the understanding of the true nature of reality. Confucius and
his followers spoke constantly of the cultivation of wisdom, saying
that it is achieved in the same way that a craftsman develops skill: by
putting in the time. Xunzi was more explicit: “Learning must never
cease. . . . The noble person who studies widely and examines himself
each day will become clear in his knowing and faultless in his
conduct.”
Each school has its own take on wisdom, but the same themes
appear in all of them: The need to ask questions. The need to study
and reflect. The importance of intellectual humility. The power of
experiences—most of all failure and mistakes—to open our eyes to
truth and understanding. In this way, wisdom is a sense of the big
picture, the accumulation of experience and the ability to rise above
the biases, the traps that catch lazier thinkers.
The fact that you are sitting here reading a book is a wonderful
step on the journey to wisdom. But don’t stop here—this book is only
an introduction to classical thinking and history. Tolstoy expressed
his exasperation at people who didn’t read deeply and regularly. “I
cannot understand,” he said, “how some people can live without
communicating with the wisest people who ever lived on earth.”
There’s another line, now cliché, that is even more cutting: People
who don’t read have no advantage over those who cannot read.

There’s little advantage to reading with arrogance or to confirm
preexisting opinions either. Hitler, spent his short prison sentence
after World War I reading the classics of history. Except instead of
learning anything, he found in those thousands of pages only that, as
he said, “I recognized the correctness of my views.”
That’s not wisdom. Or even stupidity. That’s insanity.
We must also seek mentors and teachers who can guide us in our
journey. Stoicism, for instance, was founded when Zeno, then a
successful merchant, first heard someone reading the teachings of
Socrates out loud in a bookstore. But that wasn’t enough. What he
did next was what put him on the path to wisdom, for he walked up
to the person reading and said, “Where can I find a man like that?”
In Buddhism, there is the idea of pabbajja, which means “to go
forth” and marks the serious beginning of one’s studies. That’s what
Zeno was doing. Answering the call and going forth.
Zeno’s teacher was a philosopher named Crates, and Crates not
only gave him many things to read, but like all great mentors helped
him address personal issues. It was with Crates’s help that Zeno
overcame his crippling focus on what other people thought of him, in
one case by dumping soup on Zeno and pointing out how little
anyone cared or even noticed.
Buddha’s first teacher was an ascetic named Alara Kalama, who
taught him the basics of meditation. When he learned everything he
could from Kalama, he moved on to Uddaka Ramaputta, who was
also a good teacher. It was during Ramaputta’s time that Buddha
started to realize the limitations of the existing schools and consider
striking out on his own.
If Zeno and Buddha needed teachers to advance, then we will
definitely need help. And the ability to admit that is evidence of not a
small bit of wisdom!
Find people you admire and ask how they got where they are.
Seek book recommendations. Isn’t that what Socrates would do? Add
experience and experimentation on top of this. Put yourself in tough
situations. Accept challenges. Familiarize yourself with the
unfamiliar. That’s how you widen your perspective and your
understanding. The wise are still because they have seen it all. They

know what to expect because they’ve been through so much. They’ve
made mistakes and learned from them. And so must you.
Wrestle with big questions. Wrestle with big ideas. Treat your
brain like the muscle that it is. Get stronger through resistance and
exposure and training.
Do not mistake the pursuit of wisdom for an endless parade of
sunshine and kittens. Wisdom does not immediately produce
stillness or clarity. Quite the contrary. It might even make things less
clear—make them darker before the dawn.
Remember, Socrates looked honestly at what he didn’t know.
That’s hard. It’s painful to have our illusions punctured. It’s
humbling to learn that we are not as smart as we thought we were.
It’s also inevitable that the diligent student will uncover
disconcerting or challenging ideas—about the world and about
themselves. This will be unsettling. How could it not be?
But that’s okay.
It’s better than crashing through life (and into each other) like
blind moles, to borrow Khrushchev’s analogy.
We want to sit with doubt. We want to savor it. We want to follow
it where it leads.
Because on the other side is truth.

FIND CONFIDENCE, AVOID EGO

Avoid having your ego so close to your position that
when your position falls, your ego goes with it.
—COLIN POWELL

I

n 1000 BC in the Valley of Elah, the people of Israel and Philistia
were locked in terrible war. No end was in sight until the towering
Goliath offered a bold challenge to end the stalemate between the
armies. “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let
us fight each other,” he shouted.
For forty days, not a single soldier stepped forward, not even the
king of Israel, Saul. If Goliath was driven by ego and hubris, the
Israelites were paralyzed by fear and doubt.
Then came young David, a visiting shepherd with three brothers
in the army. David heard Goliath’s challenge, and unlike the entire
army, cowering in fear, he was confident that he could fight Goliath
and win. Was he crazy? How could he possibly think he could beat
someone so big?
“When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the
flock,” David said to his brothers, “I went after it, struck it, and
rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it
by its hair, struck it, and killed it. Your servant has killed both the
lion and the bear; this Philistine will be like one of them.”
David’s confidence arose from experience, not ego. He had been
through worse and done it with his bare hands.

David knew his strengths, but he also knew his weaknesses. “I
cannot go in these,” he said after trying on a soldier’s armor,
“because I am not used to them.” He was ready to proceed with what
we could call true self-awareness (and of course, his faith).
How did Goliath respond to his tiny challenger? Like your typical
bully: He laughed. “Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?”
Goliath shouted. “Come here,” he said, “and I’ll give your flesh to the
birds and the wild animals!”
This arrogance would be short-lived.
David came at Goliath at a full sprint, a sling in one hand and a
few stones from the river in the other. In those few quick seconds,
Goliath must have seen the confidence in David’s eyes and been
afraid for the first time—and before he could do anything, he was
dead. Felled by the stone flung expertly from David’s sling. His head
cut off by his own sword.
The story of these two combatants may be true. It may be a fable.
But it remains one of the best stories we have about the perils of ego,
the importance of humility, and the necessity of confidence.
There is perhaps no one less at peace than the egomaniac, their
mind a swirling miasma of their own grandiosity and insecurity.
They constantly bite off more than they can chew. They pick fights
everywhere they go. They create enemies. They are incapable of
learning from their mistakes (because they don’t believe they make
any). Everything with them is complicated, everything is about them.
Life is lonely and painful for the man or woman driven by ego.
Donald Trump in the White House at night, his wife and son far
away, in his bathrobe, ranting about the news. Alexander the Great,
drunk again, fighting and killing his best friend over a stupid
argument, thinking of nothing but the next conquest. Howard
Hughes, trapped in his mansion, manically excited about some crazy
project (which he will inevitably sabotage).
Successful, yes, but would you want to trade places with them?
This toxic form of ego has a less-assuming evil twin—often called
“imposter syndrome.”
It’s a nagging, endless anxiety that you’re not qualified for what
you’re doing—and you’re about to be found out for it. Shakespeare’s
image for this feeling was of a thief wearing a stolen robe he knows is

too big. The writer Franz Kafka, the son of an overbearing and
disapproving father, likened imposter syndrome to the feeling of a
bank clerk who is cooking the books. Frantically trying to keep it all
going. Terrified of being discovered.
Of course, this insecurity exists almost entirely in our heads.
People aren’t thinking about you. They have their own problems to
worry about!
What is better than these two extremes—ego and imposter
syndrome—but simple confidence? Earned. Rational. Objective. Still.
Ulysses S. Grant had an egotistical, self-promoting father, who
was always caught up in some scheme or scandal. Grant knew that
wasn’t who he wanted to be. In response, he developed a cool and
calm self-confidence that was much closer to his mother’s quiet but
strong personality. It was the source of his greatness.
Before the Civil War, Grant experienced a long chain of setbacks
and financial difficulties. He washed up in St. Louis, selling firewood
for a living—a hard fall for a graduate of West Point. An army buddy
found him and was aghast. “Great God, Grant, what are you doing?”
he asked. Grant’s answer was simple: “I am solving the problem of
poverty.”
That’s the answer of a confident person, a person at peace even in
difficulty. Grant wouldn’t have chosen this situation, but he wasn’t
going to let it affect his sense of self. Besides, he was too busy trying
to fix it where he could. Why hate himself for working for a living?
What was shameful about that?
Observers often commented on Grant’s unshakable confidence in
battle. When other generals were convinced that defeat was
imminent, Grant never was. He knew he just needed to stay the
course. He also knew that losing hope—or his cool—was unlikely to
help anything.
With similar equanimity, he was equally unchanged by his
success and power in later years, not just leading a powerful army
but spending eight years as a world leader. (Charles Dana observed
of Grant that he was an “unpretending hero, whom no ill omens
could deject and no triumph unduly exalt.”) After his presidency,
Grant visited the old cabin where he and his wife had lived in those
hard days. One of his aides pointed out what an incredible rags-to-

riches story his life was—almost like the plot of an epic poem—to go
from that cabin to the presidency. Grant shrugged. “Well I never
thought about it in that light.”
This is also confidence. Which needs neither congratulations nor
glory in which to revel, because it is an honest understanding of our
strengths and weakness that reveals the path to a greater glory: inner
peace and a clear mind.
Confident people know what matters. They know when to ignore
other people’s opinions. They don’t boast or lie to get ahead (and
then struggle to deliver). Confidence is the freedom to set your own
standards and unshackle yourself from the need to prove yourself. A
confident person doesn’t fear disagreement and doesn’t see change—
swapping an incorrect opinion for a correct one—as an admission of
inferiority.
Ego, on the other hand, is unsettled by doubts, afflicted by hubris,
exposed by its own boasting and posturing. And yet it will not probe
itself—or allow itself to be probed—because it knows what might be
found.
But confident people are open, reflective, and able to see
themselves without blinders. All this makes room for stillness, by
removing unnecessary conflict and uncertainty and resentment.
And you? Where are you on this spectrum?
There are going to be setbacks in life. Even a master or a genius
will experience a period of inadequacy when they attempt to learn
new skills or explore new domains. Confidence is what determines
whether this will be a source of anguish or an enjoyable challenge. If
you’re miserable every time things are not going your way, if you
cannot enjoy it when things are going your way because you
undermine it with doubts and insecurity, life will be hell.
And sure, there is no such thing as full confidence, or everpresent confidence. We will waver. We will have doubts. We will find
ourselves in new situations of complete uncertainty. But still, we
want to look inside that chaos and find that kernel of calm
confidence. That was what Kennedy did in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
He had been in tough situations before, like when his PT boat sank in
the Pacific and all appeared to be lost. He learned then that panic
solved nothing, and that salvation rarely came from rash action. He

also learned that he could count on himself and that he could get
through it—if he kept his head. Whatever happened, he told himself
early in the crisis, no one would write The Guns of October about his
handling of it. That was something he could control, and so in that he
found confidence.
This is key. Both egotistical and insecure people make their flaws
central to their identity—either by covering them up or by brooding
over them or externalizing them. For them stillness is impossible,
because stillness can only be rooted in strength.
That’s what we have to focus on.
Don’t feed insecurity. Don’t feed delusions of grandeur.
Both are obstacles to stillness.
Be confident. You’ve earned it.

LET GO

Work done for a reward is much lower than work done
in the Yoga of wisdom. Set thy heart upon thy work,
but never on its reward. Work not for the reward; but
never cease to do thy work.
—THE BHAGAVAD GITA

T

he great archery master Awa Kenzo did not focus on teaching
technical mastery of the bow. He spent almost no time
instructing his students on how to deliberately aim and shoot, telling
them to simply draw a shot back until it “fell from you like ripe fruit.”
He preferred instead to teach his students an important mental
skill: detachment. “What stands in your way,” Kenzo once told his
student Eugen Herrigel, “is that you have too much willful will.” It
was this willful will—the desire to be in control and to dictate the
schedule and the process of everything we’re a part of—that held
Herrigel back from learning, from really mastering the art he
pursued.
What Kenzo wanted students to do was to put the thought of
hitting the target out of their minds. He wanted them to detach even
from the idea of an outcome. “The hits on the target,” he would say,
“are only the outward proof and confirmation of your
purposelessness at its highest, of your egolessness, your selfabandonment, or whatever you like to call this state.”
That state is stillness.

But detachment and purposelessness don’t exactly sound like
productive attitudes, do they? That was exactly the kind of vexing
predicament Kenzo wanted to put his students in. Most of his pupils,
like us, wanted to be told what to do and shown how to do it. We’re
supposed to care, a lot. Willful will should be a strength. That’s
what’s worked for us since we were kids who wanted to excel in
school. How can you improve without it? How can this be the way to
hitting a bull’s-eye?
Well, let’s back up.
Have you ever noticed that the more we want something, the
more insistent we are on a certain outcome, the more difficult it can
be to achieve it? Sports like golf and archery are the perfect examples
of this. When you try to hit the ball really hard, you end up snaphooking it. If you look up to follow the ball, you jerk the club and
slice it into the woods. The energy you’re spending aiming the arrow
—particularly early on—is energy not spent developing your form. If
you’re too conscious of the technical components of shooting, you
won’t be relaxed or smooth enough. As marksmen say these days,
“Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.”
Stillness, then, is actually a way to superior performance.
Looseness will give you more control than gripping tightly—to a
method or a specific outcome.
Obviously an archery master like Kenzo realized that by the early
twentieth century the skills he was teaching were no longer matters
of life and death. Nobody needed to know how to shoot an arrow for
survival. But other skills required to master archery remained
essential: focus, patience, breathing, persistence, clarity. And most of
all, the ability to let go.
What we need in life, in the arts, in sports, is to loosen up, to
become flexible, to get to a place where there is nothing in our way—
including our own obsession with certain outcomes. An actor doesn’t
become his character by thinking about it; he has to let go, dispense
with technique and sink into the role. Entrepreneurs don’t walk the
streets deliberately looking for opportunities—they have to open
themselves up to noticing the little things around them. The same
goes for comedians or even parents trying to raise a good kid.

“Everyone tries to shoot naturally,” Kenzo wrote, “but nearly all
practitioners have some kind of strategy, some kind of shallow,
artificial, calculating technical trick that they rely on when they
shoot. Technical tricks ultimately lead nowhere.”
Mastering our mental domain—as paradoxical as it might seem—
requires us to step back from the rigidity of the word “mastery.” We’ll
get the stillness we need if we focus on the individual steps, if we
embrace the process, and give up chasing. We’ll think better if we
aren’t thinking so hard.
Most students, whether it’s in archery or yoga or chemistry, go
into a subject with a strong intention. They are outcome-focused.
They want to get the best grade or the highest score. They bring their
previous “expertise” with them. They want to skip the unnecessary
steps and get right to the sexy stuff. As a result, they are difficult to
teach and easily discouraged when the journey proves harder than
expected. They are not present. They are not open to experience and
cannot learn.
In Kenzo’s school, it was only when a student had fully
surrendered, when they had detached themselves from even the idea
of aiming, having spent months firing arrows into a hay bale just a
few feet in front of them, that he would finally announce, “Our new
exercise is shooting at a target.” And even then, when they would hit
the target, Kenzo wouldn’t shower the archer with praise.
On the contrary, after a bull’s-eye, Kenzo would urge them to “go
on practicing as if nothing happened.” He’d say the same after a bad
shot. When the students asked for extra instruction, he’d reply,
“Don’t ask, practice!”
He wanted them to get lost in the process. He wanted them to
give up their notions of what archery was supposed to look like. He
was demanding that they be present and empty and open—so they
could learn.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism, the lotus flower
is a powerful symbol. Although it rises out of the mud of a pond or a
river, it doesn’t reach up towering into the sky—it floats freely,
serenely on top of the water. It was said that wherever Buddha
walked, lotus flowers appeared to mark his footprints. In a way, the
lotus also embodies the principle of letting go. It’s beautiful and

pure, but also attainable and lowly. It is simultaneously attached and
detached.
This is the balance we want to strike. If we aim for the trophy in
life—be it recognition or wealth or power—we’ll miss the target. If we
aim too intensely for the target—as Kenzo warned his students—we
will neglect the process and the art required to hit it. What we should
be doing is practicing. What we should be doing is pushing away that
willful will.
The closer we get to mastery, the less we care about specific
results. The more collaborative and creative we are able to be, the
less we will tolerate ego or insecurity. The more at peace we are, the
more productive we can be.
Only through stillness are the vexing problems solved. Only
through reducing our aims are the most difficult targets within our
reach.

ON TO WHAT’S NEXT . . .

If the mind is disciplined, the heart turns quickly from
fear to love.
—JOHN CAGE

T

he stakes of what each of us is trying to do are too high to allow
ourselves to be riven by the chatter of the news or the noise of the
crowd. The insights we seek are often buried and rarely obvious—to
find them, we need to be able to look deeply, to perceive what others
are unable to.
So we ignore the noise. We zero in on what’s essential. We sit
with presence. We sit with our journals. We empty our minds.
We try, in the words of Marcus Aurelius, to “shrug it all off and
wipe it clean—every annoyance and distraction—and reach utter
stillness.” To build a kind of mental vault or stronghold that no
distraction or false impression can breach. For brief moments, we
are able to get there. And when we’re there, we find ourselves
capable of things we didn’t even know were possible: Superior
performance. Awesome clarity. Profound happiness.
Yet that stillness is often fleeting. Why?
Because it is undermined by disturbances elsewhere—not just the
expected turbulence of the surrounding world, but also inside us. In
our spirit and our physical bodies.
“The mind tends toward stillness,” Lao Tzu said, “but is opposed
by craving.” We are like the audience at Marina Abramović’s
performance. Present for a moment. Moved to stillness for a

moment. Then back out into the city, back to the old routines and
pulled by endless desires and bad habits, as if that experience never
happened.
A flash of stillness is not what we’re after. We want consistent
focus and wisdom that can be called upon in even the most trying
situations. Getting there will require more work. It’s going to require
some holistic self-examination, treating the disease and not just the
symptoms.
The premise of this book is that our three domains—the mind, the
heart, and the body—must be in harmony. The truth is that for most
people not only are these domains out of sync, but they are at war
with each other. We will never have peace until that civil war Dr.
King described is settled.
History teaches us that peace is what provides the opportunity to
build. It is the postwar boom that turns nations into superpowers,
and ordinary people into powerhouses.
And so we must go onward to fight the next battle, to pacify the
domain of the spirit and purify our hearts, our emotions, our drives,
our passions.

THE DOMAIN OF THE SOUL

I

n retrospect, it was one of the finest moments in golf, perhaps in
all of sports. In June 2008, Tiger Woods birdied the final hole of
the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, just north of San Diego, to force an
eighteen-hole playoff. He took an early three-stroke lead but
surrendered it, only to come charging back, to birdie again and force
forty-six-year old Rocco Mediate into a head-to-head, sudden-death
round. On that 488-yard par-four, Tiger Woods would birdie a final
time to win his third U.S. Open and his fourteenth major. The second
most major victories in the history of the game.
And Woods was certainly the first person and likely the last golfer
in history to win such a roller-coaster match on a torn ACL and a leg
broken in two places. To call it a triumph of grit and determination
almost undersells Woods’s performance, because he did it with such
poise that no one watching even knew the extent of his injuries.
Woods himself knew only of the fractures, not the fact that his
knee joint was basically gone. Yet somehow, with nearly inhuman
mental and physical discipline, he transcended every limit the
complex and crushing game of golf had tried to place on him, and he
did it with little more than an occasional grimace.
We could call this moment the high-water mark of Tiger Woods’s
career. He took a six-month leave to recover from emergency knee
surgery. Not long after, his mistress, Rachel Uchitel, was caught at
his hotel in Australia, and suddenly the secrets of his personal life
were no longer secret.
When he was confronted by his wife, Tiger tried to lie his way out
of it, but the lies stopped working. Within minutes, Tiger was
sprawled out in a neighbor’s driveway, his SUV crashed into a nearby

fire hydrant and the back windows smashed by a golf club.
Unconscious, his wife weeping over him, he was, for a moment, still,
in a way he had not been perhaps since he was a baby.
It did not last long.
The tabloid nightmare of all tabloid nightmares would ensue—
twenty-one consecutive covers of the New York Post. The text
messages. The affairs with porn stars and Perkins waitresses, frantic
sex in church parking lots, sex even with the twenty-one-year-old
daughters of family friends, all made public. The stint in sex rehab,
the loss of his sponsors, and the $100 million divorce—it all nearly
broke him, as it would break anyone.
He wouldn’t win another major for a decade.
“On the surface of the ocean there is stillness,” the monk Thich
Nhat Hanh has said of the human condition, “but underneath there
are currents.” So it was for Tiger Woods. This man who had become
an icon for his ability to be calm and focused in moments of intense
stress, a man with the physical discipline to pump the emergency
brake on his 129-mile-per-hour swing if he wanted to start over, the
champion of the “stillest” of sports, was at the mercy of insatiable
riptides that lurked beneath his placid demeanor. And as any
seasoned captain of the seas of life can tell you, what’s happening on
the surface of the water doesn’t matter—it’s what’s going on below
that will kill you.
Tiger Woods could stare down opponents and unimaginable
pressure, persevere through the countless obstacles in his career. He
just couldn’t do the same for his own spiritual demons.
The seeds of Tiger’s undoing were sown early. His father, Earl,
was a complicated man. Born into poverty, Earl Woods lived through
the worst of American racism and segregation. He managed to put
himself through college and join the army, where he became a Green
Beret in Vietnam. Beneath the surface of this accomplishment there
were also currents—of narcissism, egotism, dishonesty, and greed. A
simple example: Earl Woods returned from his second tour in
Vietnam with a new wife . . . a fact he neglected to mention to the
wife and three children he already had.
When Tiger was born of that second marriage, Earl Woods was
forty-three years old and not particularly excited to become a father

again. For the first year of Tiger’s life, fatherhood mostly involved
strapping the baby in a high chair while hitting golf balls in the
garage. It was in fact in watching his father play golf—instead of
being able to play like a regular kid—that Tiger developed his almost
unnatural obsession with the game. According to family legend, at
nine months old Tiger slid down from his chair, picked up a club,
and hit a golf ball.
It’s a story that is both cute and utterly abnormal. At age two,
Tiger Woods appeared on The Mike Douglas Show to show off his
golf skills. The audience loved it, but Jimmy Stewart, the other guest
that day, was not amused. “I’ve seen too many precious kids like this
sweet little boy,” he told Douglas backstage, “and too many starryeyed parents.”
Still, his parents’ dedication is undoubtedly what allowed Tiger
Woods to become a great golfer. Thousands of hours in the garage
watching his father hit seared the beautiful mechanics of a swing into
his mind. The thousands more hours they spent at the driving range
and playing golf—thanks in part to the discounted rates Earl Woods
got at the military course near their home—were instrumental. His
parents sacrificed for him, drove him to tournaments, and hired the
best coaches.
They didn’t stop there. Earl Woods knew that golf was a mental
game, so he worked to prepare his son for the unforgiving world of
sports. Starting when Tiger was about seven, Earl took active
measures to develop his son’s concentration. Whenever Tiger teed
off, Earl would cough. Or jingle change in his pocket. Or drop his
clubs. Or throw a ball at him. Or block his line of sight. “I wanted to
teach him mental toughness,” Earl recounted. “If he got distracted by
the little things I did, he’d never be able to handle the pressure of a
tournament.”
But as Tiger got older, the training became, even by Earl’s
admission, an increasingly brutal finishing school. It was a boot
camp of “prisoner-of-war interrogation techniques” and
“psychological intimidation” that no civilized person ought to inflict
on another. “He constantly put me down,” Tiger said later. “He
would push me to the breaking point, then back off. It was wild.”
Yeah. Wild.

That’s what it is for a child to hear his father taunt him as he tries
to play a sport, to call him a “motherfucker” while he’s trying to
concentrate. Imagine how painful it would be to have your dad tell
you to “fuck off,” or to ask, “How do you feel being a little nigger?” to
try to get a rise out of you. Earl Woods even cheated when they
played together, supposedly to keep his son humble and on his game.
As Tiger reflected, this was all deliberate training to become what his
father wanted him to be: a “‘cold-blooded assassin’ on the course.”
Now, Tiger, who clearly loved his father, said that they had a code
word he could use if his father ever pushed too far—in either their
mental or physical training—and that all Tiger had to do was say it
and Earl would stop. Tiger says he never did, because he needed and
enjoyed the training, but even the word itself is illustrative. It wasn’t
a cute inside joke or some silly word that meant nothing. The word
that Tiger could utter to get his father to stop bullying him, to get
him to treat him like a normal child, was, if you can believe it:
enough.
And not only was it never uttered, but the two of them came to
refer to it almost as an expletive: the “e-word.”
The e-word was something quitters said, that only losers believed
in.
Are we surprised, then, that this talented boy would go on to win
so much? But that those wins didn’t make him happy? He was
imperturbable on the golf course and utterly miserable inside.
Tiger’s mother taught him lessons too. She told him, “You will
never, ever ruin my reputation as a parent because I will beat you.”
Notice the threat of physical violence and what it was over—not
doing wrong but embarrassing her. Earl Woods, as a husband,
showed Tiger early on how to balance this razor’s edge too. He
cheated on his wife when he traveled with his son. He drank to
excess. He even, likely in violation of amateur sporting rules,
accepted a secret $50,000-a-year stipend from IMG, the sports
agency that would eventually represent Tiger Woods.
The lesson there? Appearances are the only thing that matters.
Do whatever it takes to win—just don’t get caught.
A less talented and dedicated athlete would have been crippled by
this abuse. But Tiger Woods was not just naturally gifted, he truly

loved golf and he loved the work of it. So he got better and better.
By the time he was three, he was beating ten-year-olds. By eleven
years old, he could beat his father regularly on eighteen-hole courses.
By seventh grade, he was being recruited by Stanford. At Stanford,
where he spent two years, Tiger was an All-American and the
number one player in the country. By the time he went pro at twenty,
it was already obvious that he might become the greatest golfer who
ever lived. The richest too. His first contracts with Nike and Titleist
were worth a combined $60 million.
Tiger Woods’s first decade and a half as a pro stand as possibly
the most dominant reign ever, in any sport. He won everything that
could be won. Fourteen majors, 140 tournaments. He was ranked the
number one golfer in the world for 281 consecutive weeks. He won
more than $115 million in PGA Tour winnings. He won on every
continent except Antarctica.
There were, for those who were looking, signs of sickness: the
thrown clubs after a bad hole—and the lack of concern for the fans
this occasionally imperiled. The way he’d broken up with his
longtime high school girlfriend by packing her suitcase and sending
it to her parents’ hotel room with a letter. The way he responded
when Steve Scott saved him from accidentally scratching in their epic
head-to-head match, not even thanking him, not even acknowledging
the incredible sportsmanship of it—treating it like the weakness of
inferior prey.* The way he’d left his college golf team to go pro
without even saying goodbye to his teammates, the way after he
finished eating with family or friends he’d simply get up and leave
without saying a word. The way he could just cut people out of his
life.
Woods’s golf coach Hank Haney would say that over time Tiger
began to understand that “anyone who was brought into his world
was lucky and would be playing by his rules.” This was what he had
been taught by his parents, who raised him both as a kind of prince
and a prisoner in a psychological experiment. Fame and wealth only
added to this. “I felt I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to
enjoy all the temptations around me,” Tiger would say later. “I felt I
was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn’t have to go far to
find them.”

We can imagine Tiger Woods, like so many successful people,
getting less happy the more he achieved. Less freedom. Less and less
sleep, until it came only with medication. Even with a beautiful,
brilliant wife whom he loved, even with two children, whom he also
loved, even as the undisputed champion of his craft, he was
miserable, tortured by a spiritual malady and a crushing anxiety
from which there was no relief.
His mind was strong but his soul ached. It ached over his tragic
relationship with his father. It ached over the childhood he had lost.
It ached because it ached—Why am I not happy, he must have
thought, don’t I have everything I ever wanted?
It’s not simply that Tiger loved to win. It’s that for so long
winning was not nearly enough and never could be enough (the eword). He would tell Charlie Rose, “Winning was fun. Beating
someone’s even better.” Tiger said this after his public humiliation,
after his multiyear slump, after his stint in sex rehab. He still had not
learned. He still could not see what this attitude had cost him.
Everybody’s got a hungry heart—that’s true. But how we choose
to feed that heart matters. It’s what determines the kind of person we
end up being, what kind of trouble we’ll get into, and whether we’ll
ever be full, whether we’ll ever really be still.
When Tiger Woods’s father died in 2006, Tiger’s extramarital
affairs went into overdrive. He spent time in clubs, partying, instead
of at home with his family. His behavior on the course grew worse,
more standoffish, angrier. He also began to spend unusual amounts
of time with Navy SEALS, indulging in an impossible fantasy that he
might quit golf and join the Special Forces, despite being in his early
thirties (and one of the most famous people in the world). In one
weekend in 2007, Tiger Woods reportedly jumped out of a plane ten
times. In fact, the injuries that plague him to this day are likely a
result of that training, not golf—including an accident where his knee
was kicked out from under him in a military exercise “clearing” a
building.
There he was—rather than enjoying his wealth, success, and
family—cheating on his wife, playing a soldier in some sort of early
midlife crisis. “Mirror, mirror on the wall, we grow up like our daddy
after all,” a friend of Earl and Tiger’s would say of the situation. Like

so many of us, Tiger had unconsciously replicated the most painful
and worst habits of his parents.
Some have looked at those fruitless years after Tiger’s return to
golf as evidence that the selfishness of his previous life helped his
game. Or that somehow the work he did in rehab opened up wounds
better left bound up.
As if Tiger Woods, a human being, did not deserve happiness and
existed solely to win trophies and entertain us on television. “For
what is a man profited,” Jesus asked his disciples, “if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul?”
It’s a question we must ask ourselves. Cheating and lying never
helped anyone in the long run, whether it was done at work or at
home. In Tiger’s case, it was that he was so talented, he could get
away with it . . . until he couldn’t.
Eventually one has to say the e-word, enough. Or the world says it
for you.
In one sense, his father’s training had succeeded. Tiger Woods
was mentally tough. He was cold-blooded and talented. But in every
other part of his life, he was weak and fragile—bankrupt and
unbalanced. That stillness existed only on the golf course;
everywhere else he was at the mercy of his passions and urges. As he
worked to crowd out distractions—anything that would get in the
way of his concentration addressing each shot—he was also crowding
out so many other essential elements of life: An open heart.
Meaningful relationships. Selflessness. Moderation. A sense of right
and wrong.
These are not just important elements of a balanced life; they are
sources of stillness that allow us to endure defeat and enjoy victory.
Mental stillness will be short-lived if our hearts are on fire, or our
souls ache with emptiness. We are incapable of seeing what is
essential in the world if we are blind to what’s going on within us. We
cannot be in harmony with anyone or anything if the need for more,
more, more is gnawing at our insides like a maggot.
“When you live a life where you’re lying all the time, life is no
fun,” Tiger would say later. When your life is out of balance, it’s not
fun. When your life is solely and exclusively about yourself, it’s worse
than not fun—it’s empty and awful. Tiger Woods wasn’t just a

solitary man; he was, like so many of us in the modern world, an
island. He might have been famous, but he was a stranger to himself.
No one who reads about his endless affairs gets the sense that he was
enjoying it or that they brought him much pleasure. In fact, it almost
feels like he wanted to get caught. So he could get help.
We don’t need to judge Tiger Woods. We need to learn from him,
from both his fall and his long and valiant journey back to winning
the Masters in 2019 at forty-three years old with a fused back, with
his own young son cheering him on. Because we share the same
flaws, the same weaknesses—and have the same potential for
greatness, if we are willing to put in the work.
Marcus Aurelius would ask himself, “What am I doing with my
soul? Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-called
mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child’s soul? An
adolescent’s? . . . A tyrant’s soul? The soul of a predator—or its prey?”
We need to ask ourselves these questions, too, especially as we
become successful.
One of the best stories in Zen literature is a series of ten poems
about a farmer and his trouble with a bull. The poems are an allegory
about conquering the self, and the titles of each one map out the
journey that each of us must go on: We search for the bull, we track
the footprints, we find it, we catch it, we tame it, we ride it home.
At first the beast is untamable, it’s wild and impossible to contain.
But the message is that with struggle and perseverance, with selfawareness and patience—with enlightenment, really—eventually we
can tame the emotions and the drives inside us. As one of the poems
reads:
Being well-trained, he becomes
naturally gentle.
Then, unfettered, he obeys his master.
The narrator is in a state of serenity and peace. He has tamed his
wild spirit.
That’s what we’re trying to do. Since ancient times, people have
strived to train and control the forces that reside deep inside them so

that they can find serenity, so that they can preserve and protect
their accomplishments. What good is it to be rational at work if our
personal lives are a hot-blooded series of disasters? How long can we
keep the two domains separate anyway? You might rule cities or a
great empire, but if you’re not in control of yourself, it is all for
naught.
The work we must do next is less cerebral and more spiritual. It’s
work located in the heart and in the soul, and not in the mind.
Because it is our soul that is the key to our happiness (or our
unhappiness), contentment (or discontent), moderation (or
gluttony), and stillness (or perturbation).
That is why those who seek stillness must come to . . .
Develop a strong moral compass.
Steer clear of envy and jealousy and harmful desires.
Come to terms with the painful wounds of their
childhood.
Practice gratitude and appreciation for the world around
them.
Cultivate relationships and love in their lives.
Place belief and control in the hands of something larger
than themselves.
Understand that there will never be “enough” and that
the unchecked pursuit of more ends only in bankruptcy.
Our soul is where we secure our happiness and unhappiness,
contentment or emptiness—and ultimately, determine the extent of
our greatness.
We must maintain a good one.

CHOOSE VIRTUE

The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is
enough.
—RALPH WALDO EMERSON

M

arcus Aurelius famously described a number of what he called
“epithets for the self.” Among his were: Upright. Modest.
Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. These were, then, the traits that
served him well as emperor.
There are many other traits that could be added to this list:
Honest. Patient. Caring. Kind. Brave. Calm. Firm. Generous.
Forgiving. Righteous.
There is one word, however, under which all these epithets sit:
virtue.
Virtue, the Stoics believed, was the highest good—the summum
bonum—and should be the principle behind all our actions. Virtue is
not holiness, but rather moral and civic excellence in the course of
daily life. It’s a sense of pure rightness that emerges from our souls
and is made real through the actions we take.
The East prized virtue as much as the West. The Daodejing, for
instance, actually translates as The Way of Virtue. Confucius, who
advised many of the rulers and princes of his day, would have agreed
with Marcus that a leader was well served by the pursuit of virtue.
His highest compliment would have been to call a ruler a junzi—a
word that translators still have trouble finding equivalents for in

English but is roughly understood as a person who emanates
integrity, honor, and self-control.
If the concept of “virtue” seems a bit stuffy to you, consider the
evidence that a virtuous life is worthwhile for its own sake. No one
has less serenity than the person who does not know what is right or
wrong. No one is more exhausted than the person who, because they
lack a moral code, must belabor every decision and consider every
temptation. No one feels worse about themselves than the cheater or
the liar, even if—often especially if—they are showered with rewards
for their cheating and lying. Life is meaningless to the person who
decides their choices have no meaning.
Meanwhile, the person who knows what they value? Who has a
strong sense of decency and principle and behaves accordingly? Who
possesses easy moral self-command, who leans comfortably upon
this goodness, day in and day out? This person has found stillness.
A sort of soul power they can draw on when they face challenges,
stress, even scary situations.
Look at the response of Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh to an
angry protester during a campaign stop. When the agitated woman
came up and started shouting at him about Islam (despite the fact
that he is Sikh), he replied with two of his own epithets for the self:
“Love and courage.” Soon, the crowd began to chant along with him:
“Love and courage. Love and courage. Love and courage.”
He could’ve stood there and yelled back. He could have run away.
It could have made him cruel and mean, in the moment or forever
after. He may well have been prodded in those directions. But
instead he remained cool, and those two words helped him recenter
in the midst of what not only was a career-on-the-line situation, but
probably felt like a life-threatening one.
Different situations naturally call for different virtues and
different epithets for the self. When we’re going into a tough
assignment, we can say to ourselves over and over again, “Strength
and courage.” Before a tough conversation with a significant other:
“Patience and kindness.” In times of corruption and evil: “Goodness
and honesty.”
The gift of free will is that in this life we can choose to be good or
we can choose to be bad. We can choose what standards to hold

ourselves to and what we will regard as important, honorable, and
admirable. The choices we make in that regard determine whether
we will experience peace or not.
Which is why each of us needs to sit down and examine ourselves.
What do we stand for? What do we believe to be essential and
important? What are we really living for? Deep in the marrow of our
bones, in the chambers of our heart, we know the answer. The
problem is that the busyness of life, the realities of pursuing a career
and surviving in the world, come between us and that selfknowledge.
Confucius said that virtue is a kind of polestar. It not only
provides guidance to the navigator, but it attracts fellow travelers
too. Epicurus, who has been unfairly branded by history as a
hedonist, knew that virtue was the way to tranquility and happiness.
In fact, he believed that virtue and pleasure were two sides of the
same coin. As he said:
It is impossible to live the pleasant life without also living
sensibly, nobly, and justly, and conversely it is impossible
to live sensibly, nobly, and justly without living pleasantly.
A person who does not have a pleasant life is not living
sensibly, nobly, and justly, and conversely the person who
does not have these virtues cannot live pleasantly.
Where virtue is, so too are happiness and beauty.
Confucius wrote that the “gentleman is self-possessed and
relaxed, while the petty man is perpetually full of worry.” It’s worth a
look at Seneca, another Stoic philosopher, who, like Marcus, made
his living in politics. Like us, Seneca was full of contradictions. On
the one hand, his writings contain some of the most beautiful
meditations on morality and self-discipline ever written, and they are
obviously the result of incredible concentration and mental clarity.
On the other, Seneca was a striver—an ambitious writer-politician
who aspired to be remembered as much for his prose as for his
policies.

At the height of his career, he could be found working as a fixer
for the emperor, Nero. Nero, although he had begun as a promising
student of Seneca, did not make his teacher’s job easy. He was
deranged, selfish, distractible, paranoid, and coldhearted. Imagine
that you spend your evenings writing about the importance of doing
the right thing, of temperance and wisdom, and then by day you have
to help your all-powerful boss justify trying to assassinate his
mother. Seneca knew he should walk away; he probably wanted to,
but he never did.
What is virtue? Seneca would ask. His answer: “True and
steadfast judgment.” And from virtue comes good decisions and
happiness and peace. It emanates from the soul and directs the mind
and the body.
Yet when we look at Seneca’s life, we get the sense that he was the
type of man whose ambition did not provide much peace, but instead
skewed his decision making. Seneca wrote eloquently of the
meaninglessness of wealth, yet came to possess an enormous fortune
through questionable means. He believed in mercy, kindness, and
compassion, but he willingly served two different emperors who were
probably psychopaths. It was as if he didn’t believe in his own
philosophy enough to put it wholly into practice—he couldn’t quite
accept that virtue would provide enough to live on.
Money, power, fame just seemed a little more urgent.
Seneca knew of the virtuous path, but chased the prizes that drew
him away from it. This choice cost him many sleepless nights and
forced him into ethically taxing dilemmas. In the end, it cost him his
life. In AD 65, Nero turned on his former teacher and forced him to
commit suicide—the evil Seneca had rationalized for so long, it
eventually cost him everything.
There’s no question it’s possible to get ahead in life by lying and
cheating and generally being awful to other people. This may even be
a quick way to the top. But it comes at the expense of not only your
self-respect, but your security too.
Virtue, on the other hand, as crazy as it might seem, is a far more
attainable and sustainable way to succeed.
How’s that? Recognition is dependent on other people. Getting
rich requires business opportunities. You can be blocked from your

goals by the weather just as easily as you can by a dictator. But
virtue? No one can stop you from knowing what’s right. Nothing
stands between you and it . . . but yourself.
Each of us must cultivate a moral code, a higher standard that we
love almost more than life itself. Each of us must sit down and ask:
What’s important to me? What would I rather die for than betray?
How am I going to live and why?
These are not idle questions or the banal queries of a personality
quiz. We must have the answers if we want the stillness (and the
strength) that emerges from the citadel of our own virtue.
It is for the difficult moments in life—the crossroads that Seneca
found himself on when asked to serve Nero—that virtue can be called
upon. Heraclitus said that character was fate. He’s right. We develop
good character, strong epithets for ourselves, so when it counts, we
will not flinch.
So that when everyone else is scared and tempted, we will be
virtuous.
We will be still.

HEAL THE INNER CHILD

The child is in me still . . . and sometimes not so still.
—FRED ROGERS

T

here was always something childlike about Leonardo da Vinci.
Indeed, this is what made him such a brilliant artist—his
mischievousness, his curiosity, his fascination with inventing and
creating. But behind this playfulness was a deep sadness, pain rooted
in the events of his early life.
Leonardo was born in 1452, an illegitimate son from a prosperous
family of notaries. Though in time his father would invite his bastard
son to come live with him, and would help secure Leonardo’s first
artistic apprenticeship, a distance between them never closed.
At the time, it was customary that the oldest son of a prominent
tradesman like Leonardo’s father would be chosen to take up his
father’s profession and eventually take over his business. While the
notary guild technically did not recognize non legittimo heirs, it’s
surprising that Leonardo’s father never even attempted to appear
before a local magistrate and present a petition to legitimate his son.
Leonardo’s father would go on to have twelve more children, nine
of whom were sons. When he died, he left no specific will, an act that
for a notary, familiar with the law, meant one thing: He was legally
disinheriting Leonardo in favor of his “real” children. As Leonardo’s
biographer Walter Isaacson would later write, by excluding Leonardo
and never fully accepting him, Piero da Vinci’s “primary bequest to

his son was to give him an insatiable drive for an unconditional
patron.”
Indeed, all of Leonardo’s artistic life exhibits an almost childlike
search for love and acceptance from the powerful men he worked for.
He devotedly served his first mentor, Andrea del Verrocchio, for
more than eleven years—until Leonardo was twenty-five—an
incredibly long time for such a prodigal talent (Michelangelo broke
out on his own at sixteen). What could have attracted a sweet soul
like Leonardo to Cesare Borgia, a murderous psychopath? Borgia was
the only patron who was willing to look at and consider Leonardo’s
military inventions—a longtime passion project. From Milan to
France and to the Vatican itself, Leonardo traveled far and wide in
his career, looking for the financial support and artistic freedom he
thought would make him whole.
Nearly half a dozen times, he uprooted himself and his workshop
in a huff, leaving unfinished commissions behind him. Sometimes it
was over a slight. Usually it was because the patron couldn’t quite be
everything Leonardo wanted. The subtext of his angry letters and
half-completed work speaks as loudly to us today as any angry
teenager: You’re not my dad. You can’t tell me what to do. You don’t
really love me. I’ll show you.
Many of us carry wounds from our childhood. Maybe someone
didn’t treat us right. Or we experienced something terrible. Or our
parents were just a little too busy or a little too critical or a little too
stuck dealing with their own issues to be what we needed.
These raw spots shape decisions we make and actions we take—
even if we’re not always conscious of that fact.
This should be a relief: The source of our anxiety and worry, the
frustrations that seem to suddenly pop out in inappropriate
situations, the reason we have trouble staying in relationships or
ignoring criticism—it isn’t us. Well, it is us, just not adult us. It’s the
seven-year-old living inside us. The one who was hurt by Mom and
Dad, the sweet, innocent kid who wasn’t seen.
Think of Rick Ankiel, one of the greatest natural pitchers to ever
play baseball. He had a brutal childhood in the home of an abusive
father and a brother who was a drug dealer. His whole life, he stuffed
this pain and helplessness down, focusing on his skill on the mound,

eventually becoming the minor leagues’ top pitching prospect. Then
suddenly, just as his career was starting to go well, in the first game
of the playoffs in 2000, in front of millions of people, he lost the
ability to control his pitches.
What happened? Just days before, his father and brother had
gone to jail on drug charges and Rick had been in the courthouse to
see them. He’d been running from that pain and that anger for years,
until it finally exploded and shattered the delicate balance that
pitching required. It took years of work with Harvey Dorfman, a
brilliant, patient sports psychologist, to coax his gifts back. And even
then only so far. Ankiel would pitch only five more times in his
career, none as a starter. The rest of his career he spent in the
outfield—mostly in center field, the position farthest away from the
mound.
Sigmund Freud himself wrote about how common it is for
deficiencies, big and small, at a young age to birth toxic, turbulent
attitudes in adulthood. Because we weren’t born rich enough, pretty
enough, naturally gifted enough, because we weren’t appreciated like
other children in the classroom, or because we had to wear glasses or
got sick a lot or couldn’t afford nice clothes, we carry a chip on our
shoulder. Some of us are like Richard III, believing that a deformity
entitles us to be selfish or mean or insatiably ambitious. As Freud
explained, “We all demand reparation for our early wounds to our
narcissism,” thinking we are owed because we were wronged or
deprived. (This was Tiger Woods to the detail.)
It’s dangerous business, though, creating a monster to protect
your wounded inner child.
The insecure lens. The anxious lens. The persecuted lens. The
prove-them-all-wrong lens. The will-you-be-my-father? lens that
Leonardo had. These adaptations, developed early on to make sense
of the world, don’t make our lives easier. On the contrary. Who can
be happy that way? Would you put a nine-year-old in charge of
anything stressful or dangerous or important?
The movie producer Judd Apatow has talked about something he
realized after a big fight during the filming of one of his movies. For
years, he had seen every note the studio or the executives had for
him, every attempt at restrictions or influence, as if it were the

obnoxious meddling of his parents. Instinctively, emotionally, he had
fought and resisted each intervention. Who are these idiots to tell me
what to do? Why are they always trying to boss me around? Why
are they so unfair?
Each of us on occasion has surprised ourself with a strong
reaction to someone’s innocuous comments, or thrown a fit when
some authority figure tried to direct our actions. Or felt the pull of
attraction to a type of relationship that never ends well. Or to a type
of behavior that we know is wrong. It’s almost primal how deep these
feelings go—they’re rooted in our infancy.
It took therapy and self-reflection (and probably the observations
of his wife) for Apatow to understand that the movie studio was not
his parents. This was a business transaction and a creative
discussion, not another instance of a talented boy being bossed
around by otherwise absent parents.
But with that realization came stillness, if only because it
deintensified arguments at work. Think about it: How much better
and less scary life is when we don’t have to see it from the perspective
of a scared, vulnerable child? How much lighter will our load be if
we’re not adding extra baggage on top?
It will take patience and empathy and real self-love to heal the
wounds in your life. As Thich Nhat Hanh has written:
After recognizing and embracing our inner child, the third
function of mindfulness is to soothe and relieve our
difficult emotions. Just by holding this child gently, we are
soothing our difficult emotions and we can begin to feel at
ease. When we embrace our strong emotions with
mindfulness and concentration, we’ll be able to see the
roots of these mental formations. We’ll know where our
suffering has come from. When we see the roots of things,
our suffering will lessen. So mindfulness recognizes,
embraces, and relieves.
Take the time to think about the pain you carry from your early
experiences. Think about the “age” of the emotional reactions you

have when you are hurt or betrayed or unexpectedly challenged in
some way. That’s your inner child. They need a hug from you. They
need you to say, “Hey, buddy. It’s okay. I know you’re hurt, but I am
going to take care of you.”
The functional adult steps in to reassert and reassure. To make
stillness possible.
We owe it to ourselves as well as to the people in our lives to do
this. Each of us must break the link in the chain of what the
Buddhists call samsara, the continuation of life’s suffering from
generation to generation.
The comedian Garry Shandling lost his brother, Barry, at age ten
to cystic fibrosis, and was left for the rest of his life at the mercy of
his distraught and controlling mother, who was so disturbed by the
loss of her older son that she forbade Garry from attending the
funeral for fear that he would see her cry.
But one day, as a much older man, Garry wrote in his diary a
formula that might help him overcome that pain and not only heal
his own inner child but pass on the lesson to the many surrogate
children he had as a mentor and elder in show business.* The
formula was simple and is key to breaking the cycle and stilling the
deep anguish we carry around with us:
Give more.
Give what you didn’t get.
Love more.
Drop the old story.
Try it, if you can.

BEWARE DESIRE

Every man has a passion gnawing away at the bottom
of his heart, just as every fruit has its worm.
—ALEXANDRE DUMAS

J

ohn F. Kennedy achieved indisputable greatness through stillness
in those thirteen fateful days in October 1962. The world is
forever in his debt. But we should not allow that shining moment to
obscure the fact that, like all of us, he had demons that dogged and
haunted him and undermined that same greatness—and as a result,
his stillness.
Kennedy grew up in a house where his father often brought his
mistresses home for dinner and on family vacations. It was a house
where anger and rage were common too. “When I hate some
sonofabitch,” Joseph Kennedy liked to say, “I hate him until I die.”
It’s probably not a surprise, then, that his young son would develop
his own bad habits and wrestle with controlling his urges and
appetites.
The first time Kennedy’s sex drive got him in trouble was during
the early days of World War II, when he began dating Inga Arvad, a
beautiful Dutch journalist who many suspected was a Nazi spy.
When he was running for president, he had an affair with Judith
Exner, who happened to be the girlfriend of Sam Giancana, a
Chicago mobster. But instead of suffering any consequences for
theses massive lapses of judgment, Kennedy skated away clean each
time, a fact that only escalated his risky behavior.

Kennedy was no romantic. Girlfriends would describe his
insatiable but joyless sex drive. According to one conquest, sex was
“just physical and social activity to him,” a way to stave off the
boredom, or get a rush. He didn’t care about the other person, and in
time, he almost didn’t care about the pleasure it gave himself either.
As Kennedy told the prime minister of Britain in a moment of very
uncomfortable honesty, if he went without sex for a few days, he’d
get headaches. (His father had told his sons that he couldn’t sleep
unless he’d “had a lay.”) Given Kennedy’s terrible back, having sex
was probably painful too—but he never let that stop him.
In one shameful moment, as Soviet and American forces teetered
on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy
brought in a nineteen-year-old student from Wheaton College for a
rendezvous in a hotel near the White House. Here was a man who
had no idea how much longer he would live, who was working with
inhuman dedication in that crisis to curb the dangerous impulses of
his nation’s enemies . . . cheating on his wife, choosing to spend what
were potentially his last moments on earth in the sheets with a
random girl half his age instead of with his scared and vulnerable
family.
That doesn’t sound like stillness. It doesn’t sound particularly
glamorous either.
It sounds like a man who is spiritually broken, at the whims of his
worst impulses, unable to think clearly or prioritize. But before we
condemn Kennedy as a despicable addict or abuser, we should look
at our own failings. Do we not fall prey to various desires in our own
personal lives? Do we not know better and do it anyway?
Lust is a destroyer of peace in our lives: Lust for a beautiful
person. Lust for an orgasm. Lust for someone other than the one
we’ve committed to be with. Lust for power. Lust for dominance.
Lust for other people’s stuff. Lust for the fanciest, best, most
expensive things that money can buy.
And is this not at odds with the self-mastery we say we want?
A person enslaved to their urges is not free—whether they are a
plumber or the president.
How many great men and women end up losing everything—end
up, in some cases, literally behind bars—because they freely chose to

indulge their endless appetites, whatever they happened to be?
And at least power and sex and attention are pleasurable. The
most common form of lust is envy—the lust for what other people
have, for the sole reason that they have it. Joseph Epstein’s brilliant
line is: “Of the seven deadly sins, only envy is no fun at all.”
Democritus, twenty-four hundred years before him: “An envious
man pains himself as though he were an enemy.”
No one in the sway of envy or jealousy has a chance to think
clearly or live peacefully. How can they?
It is an endless loop of misery. We’re envious of one person, while
they envy somebody else. The factory worker wishes desperately to
be a millionaire, the millionaire envies the simple life of the nine-tofive worker. The famous wish they could go back to the private life
that so many others would gladly give away; the man or woman with
a beautiful partner thinks only of someone a little more beautiful. It’s
sobering to consider that the rival we’re so jealous of may in fact be
jealous of us.
There is also a “have your cake and eat it too” immaturity to envy.
We don’t simply want what other people have—we want to keep
everything we have and add theirs to it, even if those things are
mutually exclusive (and on top of that, we also want them to not have
it anymore). But if you had to trade places entirely with the person
you envy, if you had to give up your brain, your principles, your
proudest accomplishments to live in their life, would you do it? Are
you willing to pay the price they paid to get what you covet?
No, you aren’t.
Epicurus, again the supposed hedonist, once said that “sex has
never benefited any man, and it’s a marvel if it hasn’t injured him.”
He came up with a good test anytime he felt himself being pulled by a
strong desire: What will happen to me if I get what I want? How
will I feel after?
Indeed, most desires are at their core irrational emotions, and
that’s why stillness requires that we sit down and dissect them. We
want to think ahead to the refractory period, to consider the
inevitable hangover before we take a drink. When we do that, these
desires lose some of their power.

To the Epicureans real pleasure was about freedom from pain
and agitation. If wanting something makes you miserable while you
don’t have it, doesn’t that diminish the true value of the reward? If
getting what you “want” has its consequences too, is that really
pleasurable? If the same drive that helps you achieve initially also
leads you inevitably to overreach or overdo, is it really an advantage?
Those seeking stillness need not become full-fledged ascetics or
puritans. But we can take the time to realize how much pull and
power desire can have on us, and beyond the momentary pleasure
this might provide us, it deprives us of the deeper peace that we seek.
Think about the times when you feel best. It’s not when you are
pining away. It’s not when you get what you pined for either. There is
always a tinge of disappointment or loss at the moment of
acquisition.
Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita calls desire the “ever-present
enemy of the wise . . . which like a fire cannot find satisfaction.” The
Buddhists personified this demon in the figure of Mara. They said it
was Mara who tried to tempt and distract Buddha from the path of
enlightenment, from stillness. When Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his
notebook about how to portray envy, he said that she should be
shown as lean and haggard due to her state of perpetual torment.
“Make her heart gnawed by a swelling serpent,” he said, “make her
ride upon death because Envy never dies.” It’d be hard to find a
better depiction of lust either, which Leonardo said puts us “on the
level of beasts.”
None of us are perfect. We have biologies and pathologies that
will inevitably trip us up. What we need then is a philosophy and a
strong moral code—that sense of virtue—to help us resist what we
can, and to give us the strength to pick ourselves back up when we
fail and try to do and be better.
We can also rely on tools to help us resist harmful desires. Saint
Athanasius of Alexandria wrote in his Vita Antonii that one of the
benefits of journaling—Confessions, as the Christians called the
genre—was that it helped stop him from sinning. By observing and
then writing about his own behavior, he was able to hold himself
accountable and make himself better:

Let us each note and write down our actions and impulses
of the soul . . . as though we were to report them to each
other; and you may rest assured that from utter shame of
becoming known we shall stop sinning and entertaining
sinful thoughts altogether. . . . Just as we would not give
ourselves to lust within sight of each other, so if we were to
write down our thoughts as if telling them to each other,
we shall so much the more guard ourselves against foul
thoughts for shame of being known. Now, then, let the
written account stand for the eyes of our fellow ascetics, so
that blushing at writing the same as if we were actually
seen, we may never ponder evil.
To have an impulse and to resist it, to sit with it and examine it,
to let it pass by like a bad smell—this is how we develop spiritual
strength. This is how we become who we want to be in this world.
Only those of us who take the time to explore, to question, to
extrapolate the consequences of our desires have an opportunity to
overcome them and to stop regrets before they start. Only they know
that real pleasure lies in having a soul that’s true and stable, happy
and secure.

ENOUGH

History relates no instance in which a conqueror has
been surfeited with conquests.
—STEFAN ZWEIG

T

he writers Kurt Vonnegut, the author of Slaughterhouse Five,
and Joseph Heller, the author of Catch-22, were once at a party
in a fancy neighborhood outside New York City. Standing in the
palatial second home of some boring billionaire, Vonnegut began to
needle his friend. “Joe,” he said, “how does it feel that our host only
yesterday may have made more money than your novel has earned in
its entire history?”
“I’ve got something he can never have,” Heller replied.
“And what on earth could that be?” Vonnegut asked.
“The knowledge that I’ve got enough.”
Earl Woods called that the e-word, like it was an expletive. In
truth, enough is a beautiful thing.
Imagine the stillness that sense of enough brought Joseph Heller
and everyone else who has it. No ceaseless wanting. No insecurity of
comparison. Feeling satisfied with yourself and your work? What
gift!
Saying the word “enough” is not enough. Deeply spiritual,
introspective work is required to understand what that idea means—
work that may well destroy illusions and assumptions we have held
our entire lives.

John Stuart Mill, the philosopher and boy genius who before he
hit puberty read and mastered nearly every major classical text in the
original Greek or Latin, is an illustration of just how terrifying this
process can be. Extremely driven (by his father and by himself), one
day, at around twenty years old, Mill stopped to think, for the first
time, about what he was chasing. As he writes:
It occurred to me to put the question directly to myself,
“Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all
the changes in institutions and opinions which you are
looking forward to, could be completely effected at this
very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to
you?” And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly
answered, “No!” At this my heart sank within me: the
whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell
down.
What ensued was a devastating mental breakdown that required
years of recovery. Yet Mill was probably lucky to undergo it so early.
Most people never learn that their accomplishments will ultimately
fail to provide the relief and happiness we tell ourselves they will. Or
they come to understand this only after so much time and money, so
many relationships and moments of inner peace, were sacrificed on
the altar of achievement. We get to the finish line only to think: This
is it? Now what?
It is a painful crossroads. Or worse, one that we ignore, stuffing
those feelings of existential crisis down, piling on top of them
meaningless consumption, more ambition, and the delusion that
doing more and more of the same will eventually bring about
different results.
In a way, this is a curse of one of our virtues. No one achieves
excellence or enlightenment without a desire to get better, without a
tendency to explore potential areas of improvement. Yet the desire—
or the need—for more is often at odds with happiness. Billie Jean
King, the tennis great, has spoken about this, about how the
mentality that gets an athlete to the top so often prevents them from

enjoying the thing they worked so hard for. The need for of progress
can be the enemy of enjoying the process.
There is no stillness for the person who cannot appreciate things
as they are, particularly when that person has objectively done so
much. The creep of more, more, more is like a hydra. Satisfy one—
lop it off the bucket list—and two more grow in its place.
The best insights on enough come to us from the East. “When you
realize there is nothing lacking,” Lao Tzu says, “the whole world
belongs to you.” The verse in The Daodejing:
The greatest misfortune is to not know contentment.
The word calamity is the desire to acquire.
And so those who know the contentment of contentment are
always content.
The Western philosophers wrestled with the balance between
getting more and being satisfied. Epicurus: “Nothing is enough for
the man to whom enough is too little.” Thomas Traherne: “To have
blessings and to prize them is to be in Heaven; to have them and not
to prize them is to be in Hell. . . . To prize them and not to have them
is to be in Hell.” And the Stoics who lived in the material world of an
empire at its peak knew the truth about money. Seneca had piles of it
and he knew how little it correlated with peace. His work is filled
with stories of people who drove themselves to ruin and misery
chasing money they didn’t need and honors beyond their share.
Temperance. That’s the key. Intellectually, we know this. It’s only
in flashes of insight or tragedy that we feel it.
In 2010, Marco Rubio was pacing the halls of his home, making
fund-raising calls for his surprise Senate bid, when his three-year-old
son snuck out the back door and fell into the pool. Rubio had heard
the chime of the door opening, assumed someone else was paying
attention, and returned to his important phone call. A few minutes
later, he found his son floating facedown in their pool, barely
breathing.
Even after this near tragedy he returned almost immediately to
work—his ambition, like Lincoln’s, a “little engine that knew no rest.”

Only with distance could Rubio begin to see the cost of this drive,
what important things we miss when we give ourselves over to it
entirely. As he wrote, “I think I understand now that the restlessness
we feel as we make our plans and chase our ambitions is not the
effect of their importance to our happiness and our eagerness to
attain them. We are restless because deep in our hearts we know now
that our happiness is found elsewhere, and our work, no matter how
valuable it is to us or to others, cannot take its place. But we hurry on
anyway, and attend to our business because we need to matter, and
we don’t always realize we already do.”
Have you ever held a gold medal or a Grammy or a Super Bowl
ring? Have you ever seen a bank balance nudging up into the seven
figures? Maybe you have, maybe you possess these things yourself. If
you do, then you know: They are nice but they change nothing. They
are just pieces of metal, dirty paper in your pocket, or plaques on a
wall. They are not made of anything strong or malleable enough to
plug even the tiniest hole in a person’s soul. Nor do they extend the
length of one’s life even one minute. On the contrary, they may
shorten it!
They can also take the joy out of the thing we used to love to do.
More does nothing for the one who feels less than, who cannot see
the wealth that was given to them at birth, that they have
accumulated in their relationships and experiences. Solving your
problem of poverty is an achievable goal and can be fixed by earning
and saving money. No one could seriously claim otherwise. The issue
is when we think these activities can address spiritual poverty.
Accomplishment. Money. Fame. Respect. Piles and piles of them
will never make a person feel content.
If you believe there is ever some point where you will feel like
you’ve “made it,” when you’ll finally be good, you are in for an
unpleasant surprise. Or worse, a sort of Sisyphean torture where just
as that feeling appears to be within reach, the goal is moved just a
little bit farther up the mountain and out of reach.
You will never feel okay by way of external accomplishments.
Enough comes from the inside. It comes from stepping off the train.
From seeing what you already have, what you’ve always had.

If a person can do that, they are richer than any billionaire, more
powerful than any sovereign.
Yet instead of seizing this path to power, we choose ingratitude
and the insecurity of needing more, more, more. “We are here as if
immersed in water head and shoulders underneath the great
oceans,” said the Zen master Gensha, “and yet how pitiously we are
extending our hands for water.” We think we need more and don’t
realize we already have so much. We work so hard “for our families”
that we don’t notice the contradiction—that it’s because of work that
we never see them.
Enough.
Now, there is a perfectly understandable worry that contentment
will be the end of our careers—that if we somehow satisfy this urge,
all progress in our work and in our lives will come to a screeching
halt. If everyone felt good, why would they keep trying so hard?
First, it must be pointed out that this worry itself is hardly an ideal
state of mind. No one does their best work driven by anxiety, and no
one should be breeding insecurity in themselves so that they might
keep making things. That is not industry, that is slavery.
We were not put on this planet to be worker bees, compelled to
perform some function over and over again for the cause of the hive
until we die. Nor do we “owe it” to anyone to keep doing, doing,
doing—not our fans, not our followers, not our parents who have
provided so much for us, not even our families. Killing ourselves does
nothing for anybody.
It’s perfectly possible to do and make good work from a good
place. You can be healthy and still and successful.
Joseph Heller believed he had enough, but he still kept writing.
He wrote six novels after Catch-22 (when a reporter criticized him by
saying he hadn’t written anything as good as his first book, Heller
replied, “Who has?”), including a number one bestseller. He taught.
He wrote plays and movies. He was incredibly productive. John
Stuart Mill, after his breakdown, fell in love with poetry, met the
woman who would eventually become his wife, and began to slowly
return to political philosophy—and ultimately had enormous impact
on the world. Indeed, Western democracies are indebted to him for
many changes he helped bring about.

The beauty was that these creations and insights came from a
better—a stiller—place inside both men. They weren’t doing it to
prove anything. They didn’t need to impress anyone. They were in
the moment. Their motivations were pure. There was no insecurity.
No anxiety. No creeping, painful hope that this would finally be the
thing that would make them feel whole, that would give them what
they had always been lacking.
What do we want more of in life? That’s the question. It’s not
accomplishments. It’s not popularity. It’s moments when we feel like
we are enough.
More presence. More clarity. More insight. More truth.
More stillness.

BATHE IN BEAUTY

In the face of the Sublime, we feel a shiver . . .
something too large for our minds to encompass. And
for a moment, it shakes us out of our smugness and
releases us from the deathlike grip of habit and
banality.
—ROBERT GREENE

O

n Wednesday morning, February 23, 1944, Anne Frank climbed
up to the attic above the annex where her family had been
hiding for two long years to visit Peter, the young Jewish boy who
lived with them. After Peter finished his chores, the two of them sat
down at Anne’s favorite spot on the floor and looked out the small
window to the world they had been forced to leave behind.
Staring at the blue sky, the leafless chestnut tree below, birds
swooping and diving in the air, the two were entranced to the point
of speechlessness. It was so quiet, so serene, so open compared to
their cramped quarters.
It was almost as if the world wasn’t at war, as if Hitler had not
already killed so many millions of people and their families didn’t
spend each day at risk of joining the dead. Despite it all, beauty
seemed to reign. “As long as this exists,” Anne thought to herself,
“this sunshine and this cloudless sky, and as long as I can enjoy it,
how can I be sad?”
She would later write in her diary that nature was a kind of cureall, a comfort available to any and all who suffer. Indeed, whether it

was the blooming of spring or the starkness of winter, even when it
was dark and raining, when it was too dangerous to open the window
and she had to sit in the stifling, suffocating heat to do it, Anne
always managed to find in nature something to boost her spirits and
center herself. “Beauty remains, even in misfortune,” she wrote. “If
you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and
regain your balance.”
How true that is. And what a source of peace and strength it can
be.
The trackless woods. A quiet child, lying on her belly, reading a
book. The clouds cutting over the wing of an airplane, its exhausted
passengers all asleep. A man reading in his seat. A woman sleeping.
A stewardess resting her feet. The rosy fingertips of dawn coming up
over the mountain. A song on repeat. That song’s beat, lining up
exactly with the rhythm of events. The pleasure of getting an
assignment in before a deadline, the temporary quiet of an empty
inbox.
This is stillness.
Rose Lane Wilder wrote of looking out over the grassy plateau in
Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia:
Here there was only sky, and a stillness made audible by
the brittle grass. Emptiness was so perfect all around me
that I felt a part of it, empty myself; there was a moment in
which I was nothing at all—almost nothing at all.
The term for this is exstasis—a heavenly experience that lets us
step outside ourselves. And these beautiful moments are available to
us whenever we want them. All we have to do is open our souls to
them.
There is a story about the Zen master Hyakujo, who was
approached by two students as he began his morning chores on the
farm attached to his temple. When the students asked him to teach
them about the Way, he replied, “You open the farm for me and I will
talk to you about the great principle of Zen.” After they finished their
labors and walked to the master for their lesson, he simply turned to

face the fields, which the sun was just then rising above, extended his
arms out in the direction of the serene expanse, and said nothing.
That was the Way. Nature. The cultivated soil. The growing crops.
The satisfaction of good hard work. The poetry of the earth. As it was
in the beginning, as it will be forever.
Not that all beauty is so immediately beautiful. We’re not always
on the farm or at the beach or gazing out over sweeping canyon
views. Which is why the philosopher must cultivate the poet’s eye—
the ability to see beauty everywhere, even in the banal or the terrible.
Marcus Aurelius, who is supposedly this dark, depressive Stoic,
loved beauty in his own Whitmanesque way. Why else would he write
so vividly of the ordinary way that “baking bread splits in places and
those cracks, while not intended in the baker’s art, catch our eye and
serve to stir our appetite,” or the “charm and allure” of nature’s
process, the “stalks of ripe grain bending low, the frowning brow of
the lion, the foam dripping from the boar’s mouth.” Even of dying, he
writes, “Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with
nature. Come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened
olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to
the tree that gave it growth.”
The philosopher and the poet, seeing the world the same way,
both engaged in the same pursuit, as Thomas Aquinas said, the study
of “wonder.”
It was Edward Abbey, the environmental activist and writer, who
said that even the word wildness itself was music. It’s music we can
listen to anytime we like, wherever we live, whatever we do for a
living. Even if we can’t visit, we can think of traipsing through the
pine-bedded floor of the forest, of drifting down a slow-moving river,
of the warmth of a campfire. Or, like Anne Frank, we can simply look
out our window to see a tree. In doing this, in noticing, we become
alive to the stillness.
It is not the sign of a healthy soul to find beauty in superficial
things—the adulation of the crowd, fancy cars, enormous estates,
glittering awards. Nor to be made miserable by the ugliness of the
world—the critics and haters, the suffering of the innocent, injuries,
pain and loss. It is better to find beauty in all places and things.
Because it does surround us. And will nourish us if we let it.

The soft paw prints of a cat on the dusty trunk of a car. The hot
steam wafting from the vents on a New York City morning. The smell
of asphalt just as the rain begins to fall. The thud of a fist fitting
perfectly into an open hand. The sound of a pen signing a contract,
binding two parties together. The courage of a mosquito sucking
blood from a human who can so easily crush it. A basket full of
vegetables from the garden. The hard right angles that passing trucks
cut out of the drooping branches of trees next to a busy road. A floor
filled with a child’s toys, arranged in the chaos of exhausted
enjoyment. A city arranged the same way, the accumulation of
hundreds of years of spasmodic, independent development.
Are you starting to see how this works?
It’s ironic that stillness is rare and fleeting in our busy lives,
because the world creates an inexhaustible supply of it. It’s just that
nobody’s looking.
After his breakdown and nearly two years of struggle and
depression resulting from overstimulation and too much study,
where did John Stuart Mill find peace again for the first time? In the
poetry of William Wordsworth. And what was the inspiration of so
much of Wordsworth’s poetry? Nature.
Theodore Roosevelt was sent west by his doctor after the death of
his mother and wife to lose himself in the bigness of the Dakota
Badlands. Yes, Teddy was a hunter and a rancher and a man’s man,
but his two greatest passions? Sitting quietly on a porch with a book
and birdwatching. The Japanese have a concept, shinrin yoku—
forest bathing—which is a form of therapy that uses nature as a
treatment for mental and spiritual issues. Hardly a week passed,
even when he was president, that Roosevelt didn’t take a forest bath
of some kind.
How much cleaner we would feel if we took these baths as often
as we took hot showers. How much more present we would be if we
saw what was around us.
Bathe is an important word. There is something about water, isn’t
there? The sight of it. The sound of it. The feel of it. Those seeking
stillness could find worse ways to wash away the troubles and
turbulence of the world than actual water. A dive into a nearby river.
The bubbling fountain in a Zen garden. The reflecting pool of a

memorial for those we have lost. Even, in a pinch, a sound machine
loaded with the noises of the crashing ocean waves.
To those reeling from trauma or a stressful profession as much as
to those suffering from the ennui of modern life, Professor John
Stilgoe has simple advice:
Get out now. Not just outside, but beyond the trap of the
programmed electronic age so gently closing around so
many people. . . . Go outside, move deliberately, then
relax, slow down, look around. Do not jog. Do not run. . . .
Instead pay attention to everything that abuts the rural
road, the city street, the suburban boulevard. Walk. Stroll.
Saunter. Ride a bike and coast along a lot. Explore.
There is peace in this. It is always available to you.
Don’t let the beauty of life escape you. See the world as the temple
that it is. Let every experience be churchlike. Marvel at the fact that
any of this exists—that you exist. Even when we are killing each other
in pointless wars, even when we are killing ourselves with pointless
work, we can stop and bathe in the beauty that surrounds us, always.
Let it calm you. Let it cleanse you.

ACCEPT A HIGHER POWER

Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself.
—ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE

F

or nearly a hundred years, one of the most difficult steps in the
twelve steps of “recovery” has not been producing a fearless
moral inventory of one’s failings or the making of amends. It’s not
admitting you have a problem, finding a sponsor, or attending
meetings.
The step that many addicts—particularly the ones who fancy
themselves thinkers—struggle with intensely is the acknowledgment
of the existence of a higher power. They just don’t want to admit that
they “have come to believe a Power greater than themselves could
restore them to sanity.”
This seemingly simple step is hard, but not because the world has
become increasingly secular since Alcoholics Anonymous’s founding
in 1935. In fact, one of the founders of AA was, in his words, a
“militant agnostic.” Acknowledging a higher power is difficult
because submitting to anything other than their own desires is
anathema to what one addict describes as the “pathological selfcenteredness” of addiction.
“I don’t believe in God” is the most common objection to Step 2.
“There’s no evidence of a higher power,” they say. “Look at evolution.
Look at science.” Or they might question what the hell any of this has
to do with sobriety anyway. Can’t they just stop using drugs and

follow the other steps? “What does religion or faith have to do with
anything?”
These are perfectly reasonable questions. And yet they don’t
matter.
Because Step 2 isn’t really about God. It’s about surrender. It’s
about faith.
Remember, the only way to get over the willful will—the force
that Awa Kenzo believed was causing everyone, not just addicts, to
miss the targets we aim for—is to let go, at the deep, soul level.
While addiction is undoubtedly a biological disease, it is also, in a
more practical sense, a process of becoming obsessed with one’s own
self and the primacy of one’s urges and thoughts. Therefore,
admitting that there is something bigger than you out there is an
important breakthrough. It means an addict finally understands that
they are not God, that they are not in control, and really never have
been. By the way, none of us are.
The twelve-step process is not itself transformative. It’s the
decision to stop and to listen and to follow that does all the work.
If you really look at the teachings, Alcoholics Anonymous doesn’t
say you have to believe in Jesus or go to church. Only that you accept
“God as we understand him.” That means that if you want to believe
in Mother Earth, or Providence, or Destiny, or Fate, or Random
Luck, that’s up to you.
To the Stoics, their higher power was the logos—the path of the
universe. They acknowledged fate and fortune and the power these
forces had over them. And in acknowledging these higher powers,
they accessed a kind of stillness and peace (most simply because it
meant less fighting battles for control!) that helped them run
empires, survive slavery or exile, and ultimately even face death with
great poise. In Chinese philosophy, dao—the Way—is the natural
order of the universe, the way of a higher spirit. The Greeks not only
believed in many different gods, but also that individuals were
accompanied by a daemon, a guiding spirit that led them to their
destiny.
The Confucians believed in Tian, —a concept of heaven that
guided us while we were here on earth and assigned us a role or
purpose in life. The Hindus believed that Brahman was the highest

天

universal reality. In Judaism, Yahweh (
) is the word for Lord.
Each of the major Native American tribes had their own word for the
Great Spirit, who was their creator and guiding deity. Epicurus
wasn’t an atheist but rejected the idea of an overbearing or
judgmental god. What deity would want the world to live in fear?
Living in fear, he said, is incongruent with ataraxia.
When Krishna speaks of the “mind resting in the stillness of the
prayer of Yoga,” it is the same thing. The Christians believe that God
is that source of stillness in our lives, which extended peace and
comfort to us like a river. “Peace! Be still!” Jesus said to the sea, “and
the wind ceased and there was a great calm.”
There is no stillness to the mind that thinks of nothing but itself,
nor will there ever be peace for the body and spirit that follow their
every urge and value nothing but themselves.
The progress of science and technology is essential. But for many
of us moderns, it has come at the cost of losing the capacity for awe
and for acknowledging forces beyond our comprehension. It has
deprived us of the ability to access spiritual stillness and piety.
Are we really to say that a simple peasant who piously believed in
God, who worshipped daily in a beautiful cathedral that must have
seemed a wondrous glory to the greatness of the Holy Spirit, was
worse off than us because he or she lacked our technology or an
understanding of evolution? If we told a Zen Buddhist from Japan in
the twelfth century that in the future everyone could count on greater
wealth and longer lives but that in most cases those gifts would be
followed by a feeling of utter purposelessness and dissatisfaction, do
you think they would want to trade places with us?
Because that doesn’t sound like progress.
In his 1978 commencement address to the students of Harvard,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn spoke of a modern world where all countries
—capitalist and communist alike—had been pervaded by a
“despiritualized and irreligious humanistic consciousness.”
To such consciousness, man is the touchstone in judging
everything on earth—imperfect man, who is never free of
pride, self-interest, envy, vanity, and dozens of other
defects. We are now experiencing the consequences of

mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of
the journey. On the way from the Renaissance to our days
we have enriched our experience, but we have lost the
concept of a Supreme Complete Entity which used to
restrain our passions and our irresponsibility. We have
placed too much hope in political and social reforms, only
to find out that we were being deprived of our most
precious possession: our spiritual life.
Realism is important. Pragmatism and scientism and skepticism
are too. They all have their place. But still, you have to believe in
something. You just have to. Or else everything is empty and cold.
The comedian Stephen Colbert survived a tragic childhood guided
by a deep and earnest Catholic faith that he maintains to this day
(teaching Sunday school well into his show business career). His
mother, who bore the brunt of that tragedy when she lost her
husband and two sons in a plane crash, was his example. “Try to look
at this moment in the light of eternity,” she would tell him. Eternity.
Something bigger than us. Something bigger than we can possibly
comprehend. Something longer than our tiny humanness naturally
considers.
We could find a similar story for just about every faith.
It is probably not a coincidence that when one looks back at
history and marvels at the incredible adversity and unimaginable
difficulty that people made it through, you tend to find that they all
had one thing in common: Some kind of belief in a higher deity. An
anchor in their lives called faith. They believed an unfailing hand
rested on the wheel, and that there was some deeper purpose or
meaning behind their suffering even if they couldn’t understand it.
It’s not a coincidence that the vast majority of people who did good
in the world did too.
The reformer Martin Luther was called before a tribunal
demanding that he recant his beliefs, on threat of denunciation and
possibly death. He spent hours in prayer as he waited his turn to
testify. He breathed in. He emptied his mind of worry and fear. He
spoke. “I cannot and I will not retract, for it is unsafe for a Christian

to speak against his conscience. Here I stand, I can do no other; so
help me God. Amen.”
Is it not interesting that the leaders who end up truly tested by
turbulent times end up sincerely relying on some measure of faith
and belief to get them through difficult times?
That was the story of Lincoln. Like many smart young people, he
was an atheist early in life, but the trials of adulthood, especially the
loss of his son and the horrors of the Civil War, turned him into a
believer. Kennedy spent most of his life looking down on his parents’
Catholicism . . . but you can bet he was praying as he stood up to the
threat of nuclear annihilation.
Here I stand, I can do no other; so help me God.
Nihilism is a fragile strategy. It’s always the nihilists who seem to
go crazy or kill themselves when life gets hard. (Or, more recently,
are so afraid of dying that they obsess about living forever.)
Why is that? Because the nihilist is forced to wrestle with the
immense complexity and difficulty and potential emptiness of life
(and death) with nothing but their own mind. This is a comically
unfair mismatch.
Again, when nearly all the wise people of history agree, we should
pause and reflect. It’s next to impossible to find an ancient
philosophical school that does not talk about a higher power (or
higher powers). Not because they had “evidence” of its existence, but
because they knew how powerful faith and belief were, how essential
they were to the achievement of stillness and inner peace.
Fundamentalism is different. Epicurus was right—if God exists,
why would they possibly want you to be afraid of them? And why
would they care what clothes you wear or how many times you pay
obeisance to them per day? What interest would they have in
monuments or in fearful pleas for forgiveness? At the purest level,
the only thing that matters to any father or mother—or any creator—
is that their children find peace, find meaning, find purpose. They
certainly did not put us on this planet so we could judge, control, or
kill each other.
But this is not the problem most of us are dealing with. Instead
we struggle with skepticism, with an egotism that puts us at the
center of the universe. That’s why the philosopher Nassim Taleb’s

line is so spot on: It’s not that we need to believe that God is great,
only that God is greater than us.
Even if we are the products of evolution and randomness, does
this not take us right back to the position of the Stoics? As subjects to
the laws of gravity and physics, are we not already accepting a
higher, inexplicable power?
We have so little control of the world around us, so many
inexplicable events created this world, that it works out almost
exactly the same way as if there was a god.
The point of this belief is in some ways to override the mind. To
quiet it down by putting it in true perspective. The common language
for accepting a higher power is about “letting [Him or Her or It] into
your heart.” That’s it. This is about rejecting the tyranny of our
intellect, of our immediate observational experience, and accepting
something bigger, something beyond ourselves.
Perhaps you’re not ready to do that, to let anything into your
heart. That’s okay. There’s no rush.
Just know that this step is open to you. It’s waiting. And it will
help restore you to sanity when you’re ready.

ENTER RELATIONSHIPS

There is no enjoying the possession of anything
valuable unless one has someone to share it with.
—SENECA

A

fter his first marriage fell apart in the 1960s, the songwriter
Johnny Cash moved from Southern California to Tennessee. On
the first night in his new home, lonely and depressed, he began to
pace the length of the ground floor. It was an enormous house, all
but empty of furniture, wedged between a steep hill on one side and
Old Hickory Lake on the other. As he walked from one end of the
floor to the other, from the hill to the lake, he began to feel, almost
frantically, that something was absent.
What’s missing? he thought. Where is it? he repeated, over and
over again. Had he forgotten to pack something? Was there
something he needed to do? What wasn’t right?
Suddenly, it came to him. It wasn’t something, it was someone.
His young daughter, Rosanne. She wasn’t there. She was in
California with her mother. A house without family is no home.
Johnny Cash stopped, began to shout her name as loud as he could,
and fell to the ground and wept.
In some sense, it might seem like that is exactly the kind of
anguish that philosophy helps us avoid through the cultivation of
detachment and indifference to other people. If you don’t make
yourself dependent on anyone, if you don’t make yourself vulnerable,
you can never lose them and you’ll never be hurt.

There are people who try to live this way. They take vows of
chastity or solitude, or, conversely, try to reduce relationships to
their most transactional or minimal form. Or because they have been
hurt before, they put up walls. Or because they are so talented, they
dedicate themselves exclusively to their work. It is necessary, they
say, for they have a higher calling. The Buddha, for instance, walked
out on his wife and young son without even saying goodbye, because
enlightenment was more important.
Yes, every individual should make the life choices that are right
for them. Still, there is something deeply misguided—and terribly
sad—about a solitary existence.
It is true that relationships take time. They also expose and
distract us, cause pain, and cost money.
We are also nothing without them.
Bad relationships are common, and good relationships are hard.
Should that surprise us? Being close to and connecting with other
people challenges every facet of our soul.
Especially when our inner child is there, acting out. Or we are
pulled away by lust and desire. Or our selfishness makes little room
for another person.
The temptations of the world lead us astray, and our tempers hurt
the ones we love.
A good relationship requires us to be virtuous, faithful, present,
empathetic, generous, open, and willing to be a part of a larger
whole. It requires, in order to create growth, real surrender.
No one would say that’s easy.
But rising to this challenge—even attempting to rise to it—
transforms us . . . if we let it.
Anyone can be rich or famous. Only you can be Dad or Mom or
Daughter or Son or Soul Mate to the people in your life.
Relationships come in many forms. Mentor. Protégé. Parent.
Child. Spouse. Best friend.
And even if, as some have argued, maintaining these
relationships reduces a person’s material or creative success, might
the trade be worth it?
“Who is there who would wish to be surrounded by all the riches
in the world and enjoy every abundance in life and yet not love or be

loved by anyone?” was Cicero’s question some two thousand years
ago. It echoes on down to us, still true forever.
Even paragons of stillness struggle with what connection and
dependence might mean for their careers. Marina Abramović gave a
controversial interview in 2016 where she explained her choice to
stay single and not to have children. That would have been a disaster
for her art, she said. “One only has limited energy in the body, and I
would have had to divide it.”
Nonsense.
Nonsense that has been internalized by countless driven and
ambitious people.
How well they would do to take even a cursory look at history and
literature. German chancellor Angela Merkel has been tirelessly
supported by her husband, a man she has described as vital to her
success, and upon whose advice she depends. Gertrude Stein was
tirelessly supported by her life partner, Alice B. Toklas. Madame
Curie was long cynical about love, until she met Pierre, whom she
married and with whom she collaborated and ultimately won a Nobel
Prize. What about the dedication to On Liberty, John Stuart Mill’s
greatest work, where he calls his wife “inspirer, and in part the
author, of all that is best in my writings”? The rapper J. Cole has said
that the best thing he ever did as a musician was become a husband
and a father. “There was no better decision I could have made,” he
said, “than the discipline I put on myself of having responsibility,
having another human being—my wife—that I have to answer to.”
Stillness is best not sought alone. And, like success, it is best
when shared. We all need someone who understands us better than
we understand ourselves, if only to keep us honest.
Relationships are not a productivity hack, though understanding
that love and family are not incompatible with any career is a
breakthrough. It is also true that the single best decision you can
make in life, professionally and personally, is to find a partner who
complements and supports you and makes you better and for whom
you do the same. Conversely, choosing partners and friends who do
the opposite endangers both career and happiness.
Life without relationships, focused solely on accomplishment, is
empty and meaningless (in addition to being precarious and fragile).

A life solely about work and doing is terribly out of balance; indeed,
it requires constant motion and busyness to keep from falling apart.
The writer Philip Roth spoke proudly late in life about living
alone and being responsible or committed to nothing but his own
needs. He once told an interviewer that his lifestyle meant he could
be always on call for his work, never having to wait for or on anyone
but himself. “I’m like a doctor and it’s an emergency room,” he said.
“And I’m the emergency.”
That may be just about the saddest thing a person has ever said
without realizing it.
Dorothy Day, the Catholic nun, spoke of the long loneliness we all
experience, a form of suffering to which the only solution is love and
relationships. And yet some people inflict this on themselves on
purpose! They deprive themselves of the heaven that is having
someone to care about and to care about you in return.
The world hurls at us so many hurricanes. Those who have
decided to go through existence as an island are the most exposed
and the most ravaged by the storms and whirlwinds.
On September 11, 2001, Brian Sweeney was a passenger trapped
on hijacked United Airlines Flight 175, which was heading straight
for the South Tower of the World Trade Center. He called his wife
from one of the plane’s seatback phones to say that things were not
looking good. “I want you to know that I absolutely love you,” he told
her voicemail. “I want you to do good, have good times, same with
my parents. I’ll see you when you get here.”
Imagine the terror of that moment, yet when you hear his voice
coming through the phone, not a trace of fear. The same serene
calmness is found in the final letter written by Major Sullivan Ballou
in 1861 in the days before his Federal regiment marched out to
Manassas, Virginia, where he seemed to know for certain that he
would die in battle. “Sarah,” he wrote, “my love for you is deathless.
It seems to bind me with mighty cables, that nothing but
Omnipotence can break; and yet, my love of country comes over me
like a strong wind, and bears me irresistibly on with all those chains,
to the battlefield. The memories of all the blissful moments I have
spent with you come crowding over me, and I feel most deeply
grateful to God and you, that I have enjoyed them so long.”

Fyodor Dostoevsky once described his wife, Anna, as a rock on
which he could lean and rest, a wall that would not let him fall and
protected him from the cold. There is no better description of love,
between spouses or friends or parent and child, than that. Love,
Freud said, is the great educator. We learn when we give it. We learn
when we get it. We get closer to stillness through it.
Like all good education, it is not easy. Not easy at all.
It’s been said that the word “love” is spelled T-I-M-E. It is also
spelled W-O-R-K and S-A-C-R-I-F-I-C-E and D-I-F-F-I-C-U-L-T-Y,
C-O-M-M-I-T-M-E-N-T, and occasionally M-A-D-N-E-S-S.
But it is always punctuated by R-E-W-A-R-D. Even ones that end.
The stillness of two people on a porch swing, the stillness of a
hug, of a final letter, of a memory, a phone call before a plane crash,
of paying it forward, of teaching, of learning, of being together.
The notion that isolation, that total self-driven focus, will get you
to a supreme state of enlightenment is not only incorrect, it misses
the obvious: Who will even care that you did all that? Your house
might be quieter without kids and it might be easier to work longer
hours without someone waiting for you at the dinner table, but it is a
hollow quiet and an empty ease.
To go through our days looking out for no one but ourselves? To
think that we can or must do this all alone? To accrue mastery or
genius, wealth or power, solely for our own benefit? What is the
point?
By ourselves, we are a fraction of what we can be.
By ourselves, something is missing, and, worse, we feel that in
our bones.
Which is why stillness requires other people; indeed, it is for
other people.

CONQUER YOUR ANGER

He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and
he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

I

n 2009, Michael Jordan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of
Fame. It was the crowning achievement of a magnificent career
that included six NBA championships, fourteen trips to the All-Star
Game, two Olympic gold medals, and the highest scoring average in
the history of the sport.
Ascending the stage in a silver suit, with his trademark single
hoop earring, Michael was in tears from the start. He joked that his
initial plan had been to simply accept the honor, say thank you, and
then return to his seat. But he couldn’t do it.
He had something he wanted to say.
What ensued was a strange and surreal speech where Michael
Jordan, a man with nothing to prove and so much to be thankful for,
spent nearly a half hour listing and responding to every slight he’d
ever received in his career. Standing at the podium, in a tone that
feigned lightheartedness but was clearly deeply felt and deeply angry,
he complained of media naysayers, and of how his college coach at
North Carolina, Dean Smith, had not touted him as a promising
freshman in a 1981 interview with Sports Illustrated. He even noted
how much he spent on tickets for his children for the ceremony.
After a few sweet remarks about his family, Jordan pointed out a
man in the audience named Leroy Smith, the player who had gotten

Michael’s playing time some thirty-one years earlier. Jordan knew
that many people thought that his getting cut in high school was a
myth. “Leroy Smith was a guy when I got cut he made the team—on
the varsity team—and he’s here tonight,” Michael explained. “He’s
still the same six-foot-seven guy—he’s not any bigger—probably his
game is about the same. But he started the whole process with me,
because when he made the team and I didn’t, I wanted to prove not
just to Leroy Smith, not just to myself, but to the coach that picked
Leroy over me, I wanted to make sure you understood—you made a
mistake, dude.”
It’s a remarkable window into Michael’s mind, for several
reasons. First off, it shows how he had twisted a predictable decision
into a major slight about his self-worth. Jordan hadn’t been cut from
any team. He and Leroy had both tried out for a single spot on the
varsity team. One had made it. That’s not getting “cut”—it’s expected
that an underclassman won’t make the senior class team! Nor had it
even been a referendum on his abilities. Leroy was six foot seven.
Michael was five foot eleven at the time. It’s also so childishly selfabsorbed. As if Leroy and his coach weren’t their own people, a
teammate he could have been happy for, a mentor he could have
learned from.
Yet for decades Jordan had chosen to be mad about it.
It’s almost palpable how uncomfortable the audience grew as the
complaints grew increasingly personal and petty. At one point,
Michael mentioned a remark that Jerry Krause made in 1997,
supposedly saying that “organizations win championships,” not just
individual players. Sneering at this minor—but true—observation of
the Bulls’ general manager, Michael explained that he had
specifically not invited Krause to the ceremony in retaliation. He
mentioned with pride the time he kicked Pat Riley, the coach of the
Lakers, the Knicks, and later the Heat, out of a hotel suite in Hawaii
because he wanted to stay in it.
Friends understood that Michael had intended for the speech to
be helpful. Instead of uttering a few platitudes, he wanted to show
just what it was that created a winning mentality. How tough it was.
What it took. He wanted to illustrate how productive anger could be
—how as a player each time he was slighted, each time he was

underestimated, each time someone didn’t do things his way, it made
him a better player.
The problem is that he delivered almost the exact opposite
message.* Yes, he had shown that anger was powerful fuel. He had
also shown just how likely it is to blow up all over yourself and the
people around you.
There were undoubtedly moments in Jordan’s career when
resentment had worked to his advantage and made him play better.
It was also a form of madness that hurt him and his teammates (like
Steve Kerr and Bill Cartwright and Kwame Brown, whom he
physically fought or berated). It had cruelly wrecked the selfconfidence of competitors like Muggsy Bogues (“Shoot it, you fucking
midget,” he’d told his five-foot-three opponent while giving him a
free shot in the ’95 playoffs). In training camp in 1989, Jordan threw
a vicious elbow that knocked a rookie named Matt Brust
unconscious, and ended the man’s hopes of an NBA career.
Jordan’s game was beautiful, but his conduct was often savage
and ugly.
Was anger really the secret of Michael Jordan’s championships?
(Did his anger get him that varsity spot he wanted the next year . . .
or did growing four inches help?) Could it have actually been a
parasitic by-product that prevented him from enjoying what he
accomplished? (Tom Brady wins a lot without being mean or angry.)
If history is any indication, leaders, artists, generals, and athletes
who are driven primarily by anger not only tend to fail over a long
enough timeline, but they tend to be miserable even if they don’t. It
was without a hint of self-awareness that Nixon—who hated Ivy
Leaguers, hated reporters, hated Jews and so many other people—
said these high-minded words to his loyal staffers in his last hours in
the White House: “Always remember, others may hate you, but those
who hate you don’t win unless you hate them. And then you destroy
yourself.”
He was right. His own downfall proved it.
The leaders we truly respect, who stand head and shoulders
above the rest, have been motivated by more than anger or hate.
From Pericles to Martin Luther King Jr., we find that great leaders

are fueled by love. Country. Compassion. Destiny. Reconciliation.
Mastery. Idealism. Family.
Even in Jordan’s case, he was most inspiring not when he was
trying to dominate someone but when he was playing for the love of
the game. And his rings all came under the tutelage and coaching of
Phil Jackson, known in basketball as the “Zen Master.”
It would be unfair to say that Michael Jordan was as tortured or
pained as Richard Nixon, or that he was utterly without joy or
happiness. Still, the speech is striking. He had locked so much anger
and pain up in a closet in his soul that, at some point, the doors burst
open and the mess poured out.
Seneca’s argument was that anger ultimately blocks us from
whatever goal we are trying to achieve. While it might temporarily
help us achieve success in our chosen field, in the long run it is
destructive. How excellent is excellence if it doesn’t make us feel
content, happy, fulfilled? It’s a strange bargain that winning, as
Jordan illustrated, should require us to constantly think of the times
we were made to feel like a loser. The reward for becoming worldclass should not be that you are a walking open wound, a trigger
that’s pulled a thousand times a day.
And what of the people whose anger is more of a hot flash than a
slow burn? Seneca once more:
There is no more stupefying thing than anger, nothing
more bent on its own strength. If successful, none more
arrogant, if foiled, none more insane—since it’s not driven
back by weariness even in defeat, when fortune removes
its adversary it turns its teeth on itself.
Anger is counterproductive. The flash of rage here, an outburst at
the incompetence around us there—this may generate a moment of
raw motivation or even a feeling of relief, but we rarely tally up the
frustration they cause down the road. Even if we apologize or the
good we do outweighs the harm, damage remains—and
consequences follow. The person we yelled at is now an enemy. The
drawer we broke in a fit is now a constant annoyance. The high blood

pressure, the overworked heart, inching us closer to the attack that
will put us in the hospital or the grave.
We can pretend we didn’t hear or see things that were meant to
offend. We can move slowly, giving extreme emotions time to
dissipate. We can avoid situations and people (and even entire cities)
where we know we tend to get upset or pissed off. When we feel our
temper rising up, we need to look for insertion points (the space
between stimulus and response). Points where we can get up and
walk away. When we can say, “I am getting upset by this and I would
like not to lose my cool about it,” or “This doesn’t matter and I’m not
going to hold on to it.” We can think even of the Mr. Rogers verse
about anger:
It’s great to be able to stop
When you’ve planned a thing that’s wrong,
And be able to do something else instead
And think this song
As silly as those lyrics might seem to us in the moment, as our
temper is boiling over, are they any worse than a grown adult losing
their cool over some minor slight? Are they worse than saying or
doing something that will haunt us, possibly forever?
Not that regret minimization is the point of managing our
temper, although it is an important factor. The point is that people
who are driven by anger are not happy. They are not still. They get in
their own way. They shorten legacies and short-circuit their goals.
The Buddhists believed that anger was a kind of tiger within us,
one whose claws tear at the body that houses it. To have a chance at
stillness—and the clear thinking and big-picture view that defines it
—we need to tame that tiger before it kills us. We have to beware of
desire, but conquer anger, because anger hurts not just ourselves but
many other people as well. Although the Stoics are often criticized for
their rigid rules and discipline, that is really what they are after: an
inner dignity and propriety that protects them and their loved ones
from dangerous passions.

Clearly, basketball was a refuge for Michael Jordan, a game he
loved and that provided him much satisfaction. But in the pursuit of
winning and domination, he also turned it into a kind of raw, open
wound, one that seemed to never stop bleeding or cause pain. One
that likely cost him additional years of winning, as well as the simple
enjoyment of a special evening at the Hall of Fame in Springfield,
Massachusetts.
That can’t be what you want. That can’t be who you want to be.
Which is why we must choose to drive out anger and replace it
with love and gratitude—and purpose. Our stillness depends on our
ability to slow down and choose not to be angry, to run on different
fuel. Fuel that helps us win and build, and doesn’t hurt other people,
our cause, or our chance at peace.

ALL IS ONE

All that you behold, that which comprises both god and
man, is one—we are the parts of one great body.
—SENECA

I

n 1971, the astronaut Edgar Mitchell was launched into space.
From 239,000 miles up, he stared down at the tiny blue marble
that is our planet and felt something wash over him. It was, he said
later, “an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an
intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion
to do something about it.”
So far away, the squabbles of the earth suddenly seemed petty.
The differences between nations and races fell away, the false
urgency of trivial problems disappeared. What was left was a sense of
connectedness and compassion for everyone and everything.
All Mitchell could think of, when he looked at the planet from the
quiet, weightless cabin of his spaceship, was grabbing every selfish
politician by the neck and pulling them up there to point and say,
“Look at that, you son of a bitch.”
Not that he was angry. On the contrary, he was the calmest and
most serene he’d ever been. He wanted them—the leaders, the people
who are supposed to work on behalf of their fellow citizens—to have
the same realization he was having: the realization that we are all
one, that we are all in this together, and that this fact is the only
thing that truly matters.

The Christian word for this term is agape. It is the ecstasy of love
from a higher power, the sheer luck and good fortune of being made
in that image. If you’ve ever seen the Bernini statue of Saint Teresa,
you can get a sense of this feeling in the physical form. The caring
smile of an angel thrusting an arrow into Teresa’s heart. The rays of
golden sun shooting down from heaven. Teresa’s closed eyes and
partly opened mouth, realizing, knowing the depth of love and
connection that exists for her.
Whether it comes from the perspective of space, a religious
epiphany, or the silence of meditation, the understanding that we are
all connected—that we are all one—is a transformative experience.
Such quiet peace follows this . . . such stillness.
With it, we lose the selfishness and self-absorption at the root of
much of the disturbance in our lives.
The Greeks spoke of sympatheia, the kind of mutual
interdependence and relatedness of all things, past, present, and
future. They believed that each person on this planet had an
important role to play, and should be respected for it. John Cage
came to understand something similar as he embraced his own
quirky, unique style of music—like that four-minute-and-thirtythree-second song of silence—rather than trying to be like everyone
else. “That one sees that the human race as one person,” he wrote,
with each of us as an individual part of one single body, “enables him
to see that originality is necessary, for there is no need for eye to do
what hand does so well.”
The truly philosophical view is that not only is originality
necessary, but everyone is necessary. Even the people you don’t like.
Even the ones who really piss you off. Even the people wasting their
lives, cheating, or breaking the rules are part of the larger equation.
We can appreciate—or at least sympathize with—them, rather than
try to fight or change them.
Robert Greene, known for his amoral study of power and
seduction, actually writes in his book The Laws of Human Nature
about the need to practice mitfreude, the active wishing of goodwill
to other people, instead of schadenfreude, the active wishing of ill
will. We can make an active effort to practice forgiveness, especially
to those who might have caused those inner-child wounds we have

worked to heal. We can seek understanding with those we disagree
with. Tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner. To understand all is to
forgive all. To love all is to be at peace with all, including yourself.
Take something you care about deeply, a possession you cherish,
a person you love, or an experience that means a lot to you. Now take
that feeling, that radiating warmth that comes up when you think
about it, and consider how every single person, even murderers on
death row, even the jerk who just shoved you in the supermarket, has
that same feeling about something in their lives. Together, you share
that. Not only do you share it, but you share it with everyone who has
ever lived. It connects you to Cleopatra and Napoleon and Frederick
Douglass.
You can do the same with your pain. As bad as you might feel in a
given moment, this too is a shared feeling, a connection with others.
The man stepping outside to take a walk after an argument with his
spouse. The mother worrying about her child, the one who seems to
always be in trouble. The merchant stressing over where the money
will come from—How will I keep going? Two siblings grieving the
loss of a parent. The average citizen following the news, hoping their
country will avoid an unnecessary war.
No one is alone, in suffering or in joy. Down the street, across the
ocean, in another language, someone else is experiencing nearly the
exact same thing. It has always been and always will be thus.
You can even use this to connect more deeply with yourself and
your own life. The moon you’re looking at tonight is the same moon
you looked at as a scared young boy or girl, it’s the same you’ll look at
when you’re older—in moments of joy and in pain—and it’s the same
that your children will look at in their own moments and their own
lives.
When you step back from the enormity of your own immediate
experience—whatever it is—you are able to see the experience of
others and either connect with them or lessen the intensity of your
own pain. We are all strands in a long rope that stretches back
countless generations and ties together every person in every country
on every continent. We are all thinking and feeling the same things,
we are all made of and motivated by the same things. We are all
stardust. And no one needs this understanding more than the

ambitious or the creative, since they live so much in their own heads
and in their own bubble.
Finding the universal in the personal, and the personal in the
universal, is not only the secret to art and leadership and even
entrepreneurship, it is the secret to centering oneself. It both turns
down the volume of noise in the world and tunes one in to the quiet
wavelength of wisdom that sages and philosophers have long been
on.
This connectedness and universality does not need to stop at our
fellow man. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum recently pointed out
the narcissism of the human obsession with what it means to be
human. A better, more open, more vulnerable, more connected
question is to ask what it means to be alive, or to exist, period. As she
wrote:
We share a planet with billions of other sentient beings,
and they all have their own complex ways of being
whatever they are. All of our fellow animal creatures, as
Aristotle observed long ago, try to stay alive and reproduce
more of their kind. All of them perceive. All of them desire.
And most move from place to place to get what they want
and need.
We share much of our DNA with these creatures, we breathe the
same air, we walk on the same land and swim in the same oceans.
We are inextricably intertwined with each other—as are our fates.
The less we are convinced of our exceptionalism, the greater
ability we have to understand and contribute to our environment, the
less blindly driven we are by our own needs, the more clearly we can
appreciate the needs of those around us, the more we can appreciate
the larger ecosystem of which we are a part.
Peace is when we realize that victory and defeat are almost
identical spots on one long spectrum. Peace is what allows us to take
joy in the success of others and to let them take joy in our own. Peace
is what motivates a person to be good, to treat every other living

thing well, because they understand that it is a way to treat
themselves well.
We are one big collective organism engaged in one endless
project together. We are one.
We are the same.
Still, too often we forget it, and we forget ourselves in the process.

ON TO WHAT’S NEXT . . .

Very few go astray who comport themselves with
restraint.
—CONFUCIUS

L

’essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.
What’s essential is invisible to the eye.
The quote that hung on Fred Rogers’s wall was actually only a
partial quote. The rest appears in The Little Prince, the beautiful and
surreal children’s book by the French aviator and World War II hero
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. In it, the fox tells the little boy, “Here is
my secret. It is very simple: It is only with the heart that one can see
rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.”
First, we sought mental clarity. But quickly we realized that the
soul must be in equally good order if we wish to achieve stillness. In
concert with each other—clarity in the mind and in the soul—we find
both excellence and unbreakable tranquility. It is with the heart and
soul that we are able to surface important things that the eyes need
to see.
Examining our souls is not as easy as clearing our minds, you’ll
find. It requires that we peel back what the writer Mark Manson has
called the “self-awareness onion” and take responsibility for our own
emotions and impulses. Anyone who’s done it can tell you that tears
and onions often go together.
But it’s precisely this soft stuff—getting in touch with ourselves,
finding balance and meaning, cultivating virtue—that the volleyball

champion Kerri Walsh Jennings has said makes her such a killer on
the court.
Some ancient traditions have held that the soul is in the belly,
which is fitting for two reasons. Because we’ve just been through the
belly of the beast part of our journey, and because it sets up where
we go next.
Stillness isn’t merely an abstraction—something we only think
about or feel. It’s also real. It’s in our bodies. Seneca warned us not to
“suppose that the soul is at peace when the body is still.” Vice versa.
Lao Tzu said that “movement is the foundation of stillness.”
What follows then is the final domain of stillness. The literal form
that our form takes in the course of day-to-day life. Our bodies
(where, you must not forget, the heart and the brain are both
located). The environment we put those bodies in. The habits and
routines to which we subject that body.
A body that is overworked or abused is not only actually not still,
it creates turbulence that ripples through the rest of our lives. A mind
that is overtaxed and ill-treated is susceptible to vice and corruption.
A spoiled, lazy existence is the manifestation of spiritual emptiness.
We can be active, we can be on the move, and still be still. Indeed, we
have to be active for the stillness to have any meaning.
Life is hard. Fortune is fickle. We can’t afford to be weak. We
can’t afford to be fragile. We must strengthen our bodies as the
physical vessel for our minds and spirit, subject to the capriciousness
of the physical world.
Which is why we now move on to this final domain of stillness—
the body—and its place in the real world. In real life.

MIND ♦ SPIRIT ♦ BODY

We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is
our own flesh and blood and bones.

THE DOMAIN OF THE BODY

W

inston Churchill had a productive life.
He first saw combat at age twenty-one, and wrote his first
bestselling book about it not long after. By twenty-six, he’d been
elected to public office and would serve in government for the next
six and half decades. He’d write some ten million words and over
forty books, paint more than five hundred paintings, and give some
twenty-three hundred speeches in the course of his time on this
planet. In between all that, he managed to hold the positions of
minister of defense, first lord of the admiralty, chancellor of the
exchequer, and of course, prime minister of Britain, where he helped
save the world from the Nazi menace. Then, to top it off, he spent his
twilight years fighting the totalitarian communist menace.
“It is a pushing age,” Churchill wrote his mother as a young man,
“and we must shove with the rest.” It may well be that Winston
Churchill was the greatest pusher in all of history. His life spanned
the final cavalry charge of the British Empire, which he witnessed as
a young war correspondent in 1898, and ended well into the nuclear
age, indeed the space age, both of which he helped usher in. His first
trip to America was on a steamship (to be introduced on stage by
Mark Twain, no less), and his final one on a Boeing 707 that flew at
500 miles per hour. In between he saw two world wars, the invention
of the car, radio, and rock and roll, and countless trials and
triumphs.
Is there stillness to be found here? Could someone that active, so
Herculean in their labors, who embraced so much strife and stress,
ever be described as still, or at peace?
Strangely, yes.

As Paul Johnson, one of Churchill’s best biographers, would
write, “The balance he maintained between flat-out work and
creative and restorative leisure is worth study by anyone holding a
top position.” Johnson as a seventeen-year-old, decades before his
own career as a writer, met Churchill on the street and shouted to
him, “Sir, to what do you attribute your success in life?”
Immediately, Churchill replied, “Conservation of energy. Never
stand up when you can sit down, and never sit down when you can
lie down.”
Churchill conserved his energy so that he never shirked from a
task, or backed down from a challenge. So that, for all this work and
pushing, he never burned himself out or snuffed out the spark of joy
that made life worth living. (Indeed, in addition to the importance of
hard work, Johnson said the other four lessons from Churchill’s
remarkable life were to aim high; to never allow mistakes or criticism
to get you down; to waste no energy on grudges, duplicity, or
infighting; and to make room for joy.) Even during the war, Churchill
never lost his sense of humor, never lost sight of what was beautiful
in the world, and never became jaded or cynical.
Different traditions offer different prescriptions for the good life.
The Stoics urged determination and iron self-will. The Epicureans
preached relaxation and simple pleasures. The Christians spoke of
saving mankind and glorifying God. The French, a certain joie de
vivre. The happiest and most resilient of us manage to incorporate a
little of each each of these approaches into our lives, and that was
certainly true of Churchill. He was a man of great discipline and
passion. He was a soldier. He was a lover of books, a believer in glory
and honor. A statesman, a literal bricklayer, and a painter. We are all
worms, he once joked to a friend, simple organisms that eat and
defecate and then die, but he liked to think of himself as a
glowworm.
In addition to his impressive mental abilities and spiritual
strength, Churchill was also an unexpected—given his portly frame—
master of the third and final domain of stillness, the physical one.
Few would have predicted he would distinguish himself here.
Born with a frail constitution, Churchill complained as a young man
that he was “cursed with so feeble a body that I can hardly support

the fatigues of the day.” Yet like Theodore Roosevelt before him, he
cultivated inside this frail body an indomitable soul and a
determined mind that overcame his physical limitations.
It’s a balance that everyone aspiring to sustained inner peace
must strike. Mens sana in corpore sano—a strong mind in a strong
body. Remember, when we say that someone “showed so much
heart,” we don’t mean emotion. We mean they had tenacity and grit.
The metaphor is actually misleading if you think about it. It’s really
the spine—the backbone of body—that’s doing the work.
Young Churchill loved the written word, but, diverging from the
traditional path of a writer, he didn’t lock himself up with books in a
dusty old library. He put his body into action. Serving in or observing
three straight wars, he made his name chronicling the exploits of the
empire, first as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer
War, where he was taken prisoner in 1899 and barely escaped with
his life.
In 1900, he was elected to his first political office. By age thirtythree, realizing that greatness was impossible alone, he committed
his body to another. He married his wife, Clementine, a brilliant,
calming influence who balanced out many of his worst traits. It was
one of the great marriages of the age—they called each other “Pug”
and “Cat”—marked by true affection and love. “My ability to
persuade my wife to marry me,” he said, was “quite my most brilliant
achievement. . . . Of course, it would have been impossible for any
ordinary man to have got through what I had to go through in peace
and war without the devoted aid of what we call, in England, one’s
better half.”
As busy and ambitious as Churchill was—as much of a pusher as
he was—he was rarely frantic and did not tolerate disorganization. It
almost ruins the fun to learn that Churchill’s infamous bons mots
and one-liners were in fact well-practiced and rehearsed. No one
knew the effort that went into them, he said, nor the effort that went
into making them look effortless. “Every night,” he said, “I try myself
by court martial to see if I have done anything effective during the
day. I don’t mean just pawing the ground—anyone can go through
the motions—but something really effective.”

As a writer, he was gaspingly productive. While holding political
office, Churchill managed to publish seven books between 1898 and
the end of World War I alone. How did he do it? How did he manage
to pull so much out of himself? The simple answer: physical routine.
Each morning, Churchill got up around eight and took his first
bath, which he entered at 98 degrees and had cranked up to 104
while he sat (and occasionally somersaulted) in the water. Freshly
bathed, he would spend the next two hours reading. Then he
responded to his daily mail, mostly pertaining to his political duties.
Around noon he’d stop in to say hello to his wife for the first time—
believing all his life that the secret to a happy marriage was that
spouses should not see each other before noon. Then he tackled
whatever writing project he was working on—likely an article or a
speech or a book. By early afternoon he would be writing at a
fantastic clip and then abruptly stop for lunch (which he would
finally dress for). After lunch, he would go for a walk around
Chartwell, his estate in the English countryside, feeding his swans
and fish—to him the most important and enjoyable part of the day.
Then he would sit on the porch and take in the air, thinking and
musing. For inspiration and serenity he might recite poetry to
himself. At 3 p.m., it was time for a two-hour nap. After the nap, it
was family time and then a second bath before a late, seated and
formal dinner (after 8 p.m.). After dinner and drinks, one more
writing sprint before bed.
It was a routine he would stick to even on Christmas.
Churchill was a hard worker and a man of discipline—but like us,
he was not perfect. He often worked more than he should have,
usually because he spent more money than he needed to (and it
produced a fair bit of writing that would have better remained
unpublished). Churchill was impetuous, liked to gamble, and was
prone to overcommit. It wasn’t from the tireless execution of his
wartime duties that he was inspired to depict himself once, in a
drawing, as a pig carrying a twenty-thousand-pound weight. It was
his indulgences that produced that.
Nor was his life an endless series of triumphs. Churchill made
many mistakes, usually lapses of judgment that came from a mind
fried by stress. Thus, he emerged from World War I with a mixed

record. His service in the wartime administration had been marked
by some major failures, but he had redeemed himself by resigning
and serving on the front lines with the Royal Scots Fusiliers. After
the war, he was called back to serve as secretary of state for war and
air and then secretary of state for the colonies.
The mid-1920s saw Churchill serving as chancellor of the
exchequer (a position in which he was in way over his head), while
having also signed a contract to produce a six-volume, threethousand-page account of the war, titled The World Crisis. Left to his
own devices, he might have tried to white-knuckle this incredible
workload. But those around him saw the toll that his responsibilities
were taking and, worried about burnout, urged him to find a hobby
that might offer him a modicum of pleasure and enjoyment and rest.
“Do remember what I said about resting from current problems,”
Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin wrote to him. “A big year will soon
begin and much depends on your keeping fit.”
In typical Churchillian fashion, he chose an unexpected form of
leisure: bricklaying. Taught the craft by two employees at Chartwell,
he immediately fell in love with the slow, methodical process of
mixing mortar, troweling, and stacking bricks. Unlike his other
professions, writing and politics, bricklaying didn’t wear down his
body, it invigorated him. Churchill could lay as many as ninety bricks
an hour. As he wrote to the prime minister in 1927, “I have had a
delightful month building a cottage and dictating a book: 200 bricks
and 2000 words a day.” (He also spent several hours a day on his
ministerial duties.) A friend observed how good it was for Churchill
to get down on the ground and interact with the earth. This was also
precious time he spent with his youngest daughter, Sarah, who
dutifully carried the bricks for her father as his cute and well-loved
apprentice.
A dark moment in World War I had inspired another hobby—oil
painting. He was introduced to it by his sister-in-law, who, sensing
that Churchill was a steaming kettle of stress, handed him a small kit
of paints and brushes her young children liked to play with. In a little
book titled Painting as a Pastime, Churchill spoke eloquently of a
reliance on new activities that use other parts of our minds and
bodies to relieve the areas where we are overworked. “The cultivation

of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of first
importance to a public man,” he wrote. “To be really happy and really
safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must
all be real.”
Churchill was not a particularly good painter (his bricklaying was
often corrected by professionals too), but even a glance at his
pictures reveals how much he enjoyed himself as he worked. It’s
palpable in the brushstrokes. “Just to paint is great fun,” he would
say. “The colors are lovely to look at and delicious to squeeze out.”
Early on, Churchill was advised by a well-known painter never to
hesitate in front of the canvas (that is to say, overthink), and he took
it to heart. He wasn’t intimidated or discouraged by his lack of skill
(only this could explain the audacity it took for him to add a mouse
to a priceless Peter Paul Rubens painting that hung in one of the
prime minister’s residences). Painting was about expression of joy
for Churchill. It was leisure, not work.
Painting, like all good hobbies, taught the practitioner to be
present. “This heightened sense of observation of Nature,” he wrote,
“is one of the chief delights that have come to me through trying to
paint.” He had lived for forty years on planet Earth consumed by his
work and his ambition, but through painting, his perspective and
perception grew much sharper. Forced to slow down to set up his
easel, to mix his paints, to wait for them to dry, he saw things he
would have previously blown right past.
This was a skill that he actively cultivated—increasing his mental
awareness by way of physical exercises. Churchill started going to
museums to look at paintings, then he’d wait a day and try to recreate them from memory. Or he’d try to capture a landscape he had
seen after he had left it. (This was similar to his habit of reciting
poetry aloud.) “Painting challenged his intellect, appealed to his
sense of beauty and proportion, unleashed his creative impulse,
and . . . brought him peace,” remarked his lifelong friend Violet
Bonham Carter. It was also, she said, the only thing Churchill ever
did silently. His other daughter, Mary, observed that painting and
manual labor “were the sovereign antidotes to the depressive
element in his nature.” Churchill was happy because he got out of his
own head and put his body to work.

How necessary this turned out to be, because in 1929 his
stunning political career suddenly came to what appeared to be an
ignominious end. Driven from political life, Churchill spent a decade
in pseudo-exile at Chartwell, while Neville Chamberlain and a
generation of British politicians appeased the growing threat of
Fascism in Europe.
Life does that to us. It kicks our ass. Everything we work for can
be taken away. All our powers can be rendered impotent in a
moment. What follows this is not just an issue of spirit or the mind,
it’s a real physical question: What do you do with your time? How
do you handle the stress of the whiplash?
Marcus Aurelius’s answer was that in these situations one must
“love the discipline you know and let it support you.” In 1915, reeling
from the failure of the Gallipoli campaign, Churchill wrote of feeling
like a “sea-beast fished up from the depths, or a diver too suddenly
hoisted, my veins threatened to burst from the fall in pressure. I had
great anxiety and no means of relieving it; I had vehement
convictions and small power to give effect to them.” It was then that
he picked up painting, and in 1929, experiencing a similar loss in
cabin pressure, he returned to his discipline and his hobbies for relief
and for reflection.
Churchill didn’t know it in the middle of the 1930s, but being out
of power during Germany’s rearmament was exactly the right place
to be. It would take real strength to stay there, to not fight his way
back in, but if he had, he would have been sullied by the
incompetence of his peers in the government. Churchill was likely
one of the only British leaders to take the time to sit through and
digest Hitler’s Mein Kampf (if Chamberlain had, perhaps Hitler
could have been stopped sooner). This time allowed Churchill to
actively pursue his writing and radio careers, which made him a
beloved celebrity in America (and primed the country for its eventual
alliance with Britain). He spent time with his goldfish and his
children and his oils.
Also, he had to wait. For the first time in his life, excepting those
afternoons on the porch, he had to do nothing.
Would Churchill have been the outsider called back to lead
Britain in its finest hour had he allowed the indignity of his political

exile to overwhelm his mind, burrow into his soul, and compel him
to fight his way back into the limelight in those years? Could he have
had the energy and strength at age sixty-six to put the country on his
back and lead without that supposedly “lost” decade? If he had kept
up his breakneck pace?
Almost certainly not.
Churchill himself would write that every prophet must be forced
into the wilderness—where they undergo solitude, deprivation,
reflection, and meditation. It’s from this physical ordeal he said that
“psychic dynamite” is made. When Churchill was recalled, he was
ready. He was rested. He could see what no one else could or would.
Everyone else cowered in fear of Hitler, but Churchill did not.
Instead, he fought. He stood alone. As he said to the House of
Commons:
Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and
famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the
Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall
not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in
France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall
fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the
air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be,
we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing
grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we
shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even
if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a
large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our
Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British
Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good
time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps
forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.
Churchill demanded equal courage from those in his own house.
When asked by his daughter-in-law what they could possibly do if
the Germans invaded Britain, he growled and replied, “You can

always get a carving knife from the kitchen and take one with you,
can’t you?”
The British Empire had been responsible for despicable human
rights violations, but Churchill knew irredeemable evil when he saw
it, and its name was Nazism. Concentration camps and genocidal
extermination still lay off in the future, but Churchill saw that no
self-respecting leader, no country of virtue could make a deal with
Hitler. Even if that was easier. Even if it might have protected Britain
from invasion. At the same time, he was careful to manage the
passions that war stirs up. “I hate nobody except Hitler,” he said
“and that is professional.”
Churchill was an indefatigable workhorse from the day Britain
declared war on Germany in 1939 until the end of the war in mid1945. During the war, Clementine designed a special suit her
husband could wear and sleep in. They were called his “siren suits”—
though the British public endearingly referred to them as his
“rompers”—and they saved him precious minutes getting dressed,
allowing him to grab much-needed naps.
So, yes, he was out of balance in those years, working 110-hour
weeks, and hardly ever still. It has been estimated that he traveled
110,000 miles by air and sea and car between 1940 and 1943 alone.
During the war, it was said that Churchill kept “less schedule than a
forest fire and had less peace than a hurricane.” But then again, he’d
rested up for precisely this moment—and when it was an option, he
did maintain his routine, even when he was living like a gopher in the
underground bunker that was the Cabinet War Rooms. He didn’t
have much time for painting during the war—nor many chances to be
out in nature—but when he could he did. (One is a beautiful painting
of a North African sunset, which he drove an extra five hours to
capture after the major war powers met at Casablanca.)
It is unlikely that any single individual has ever done more to save
or advance the notions sacred to Eastern or Western civilization. And
how was Churchill rewarded for these labors, for all that he had
done?
In 1945, he was pushed out of office. Upon hearing the news,
Clementine attempted to console him by saying, “Perhaps this is a

blessing in disguise.” “It must be very well-disguised,” Churchill
replied. He was wrong. She was right. As usual.
Not only because it allowed Churchill to write his final set of
memoirs, The Second World War, which firmly established and
taught the lessons that have prevented the world from veering
toward suicide since, but because it allowed him once again to rest
up and balance himself. We can see photos of him painting in
Marrakech in 1948, in the south of France in the 1950s. In all he
would paint some 550 paintings in his lifetime, 145 of them after the
war.
It was, in the end, a life of much struggle and sacrifice, a lot of it
thankless and misunderstood. It was productive, but at a high
personal cost. The same tasks and responsibilities would have
burned out and burned through a dozen normal people.
“Was it worth it?” a wearied hero had asked in Churchill’s only
novel. “The struggle, the labor, the constant rush of affairs, the
sacrifice of so many things that make life easy, or pleasant—for
what?” He wrote that when he was young, when he had been busy
and ambitious, and but not yet truly engaged in public service. In the
future lay fifty-five years in Parliament, thirty-one years as a
minister, and nine years as prime minister. The years ahead would
show him the true meaning of life and what it meant to really fight
for causes that mattered. He experienced both triumph and disaster.
And by the end of his life, he came to know that it was all worth it—
and certainly all of us alive today are grateful for those labors.
Indeed, Churchill’s last words were confirmation of this fact:
The journey has been enjoyable and well worth making—
once!
Epicurus once said that the wise will accomplish three things in
their life: leave written works behind them, be financially prudent
and provide for the future, and cherish country living. That is to say,
we will be reflective, we will be responsible and moderate, and we
will find time to relax in nature. It cannot be said that Churchill did

not do these things well (even granting that he did live it up when he
could afford to).
We compare this description to the three words Aristotle used to
describe the lives of slaves in his time: “Work, punishment, and
food.”
Which of these are we closer to in the modern world? Which of
these is the path to happiness and stillness?
No one can afford to neglect the final domain in our journey to
stillness. What we do with our bodies. What we put in our bodies.
Where we dwell. What kind of routine and schedule we keep. How
we find leisure and relief from the pressures of life.
If we are to be half as productive as Churchill, and manage to
capture the same joy and zest and stillness that defined his life, there
are traits we will need to cultivate. Each of us will need to:
Rise above our physical limitations.
Find hobbies that rest and replenish us.
Develop a reliable, disciplined routine.
Spend time getting active outdoors.
Seek out solitude and perspective.
Learn to sit—to do nothing when called for.
Get enough sleep and rein in our workaholism.
Commit to causes bigger than ourselves.
As they say, the body keeps score. If we don’t take care of
ourselves physically, if we don’t align ourselves properly, it doesn’t
matter how strong we are mentally or spiritually.
This will take effort. Because we will not simply think our way to
peace. We can’t pray our soul into better condition. We’ve got to
move and live our way there. It will take our body—our habits, our
actions, our rituals, our self-care—to get our mind and our spirit in
the right place, just as it takes our mind and spirit to get our body to
the right place.
It’s a trinity. A holy one. Each part dependent on the others.

SAY NO

The advantages of nonaction.
Few in the world attain these.
—THE DAODEJING

W

hen Fabius was dispatched to lead the Roman legions against
Hannibal, he did nothing. He did not attack. He did not race
out to drive the terrifying invader out of Italy and back to Africa.
You might think this was a sign of weakness—certainly most of
Rome did—but in fact, it was all part of Fabius’s strategy. Hannibal
was far from home, he was losing men to the elements and could not
easily replace them. Fabius believed that if Rome just held out and
did not engage in any costly battles, they would win.
But the mob couldn’t handle that kind of deliberate restraint.
We’re the strongest army in the world, his critics said. We don’t sit
around doing nothing when someone tries to attack us! So while
Fabius was away attending a religious ceremony, they pressured his
commander Minucius to attack.
It did not go well. He ran straight into a trap. Fabius had to rush
to his rescue. And even then, Minucius was hailed as a hero for doing
something, while Fabius was labeled a coward for holding himself
back. When his term ended, the Roman assemblies voted to abandon
what is now known as a “Fabian strategy” of mostly avoiding battle
and wearing Hannibal down, in favor of greater aggression and more
action.

It didn’t work. Only after the bloodbath at the Battle of Cannae, in
which the Romans attacked Hannibal and lost nearly their entire
army in a horrific rout, did people finally begin to understand
Fabius’s wisdom. Now they could see that what had looked like an
excess of caution was in fact a brilliant method of warfare. He had
been buying time and giving his opponent a chance to destroy
himself. Only now—and not a moment too soon—were they ready to
listen to him.
While most great Romans were given honorific titles that
highlighted their great victories or accomplishments in foreign lands,
Fabius was later given one that stands out: Fabius Cunctator.
The Delayer.
He was special for what he didn’t do—for what he waited to do—
and has stood as an important example to all leaders since.
Especially the ones feeling pressure from themselves or their
followers to be bold or take immediate action.
In baseball, you make a name for yourself by swinging for the
fences. Particularly for players from small, poor countries, showing
your power as a home run hitter is how you get noticed by scouts and
coaches. As they say in the Dominican Republic, “You don’t walk off
the island.” Meaning, you hit your way off.
It’s like life. You can’t benefit from opportunities you don’t try to
take advantage of.
But Dr. Jonathan Fader, an elite sports psychologist who has
spent nearly a decade with the New York Mets, has talked about just
how problematic this lesson is for rookie players in the majors. They
built their reputations, and therefore their identities, on swinging at
every pitch they thought they could hit . . . and now they’re facing the
best pitchers in the world. Suddenly, aggression is a weakness, not a
strength. Now they have to get up there in front of millions of people,
getting paid millions of dollars, and mostly not swing the bat. They
have to wait for the perfect pitch.
What they have to learn, what the great hitter Sadaharu Oh
himself learned in a series of complicated batting exercises designed
by his Zen master and hitting coach, Hiroshi Arakawa, was the power
of waiting, the power of precision, the power of the void. Because
that’s what makes for a real pro. A truly great hitter—not just a

swinger—needs quick hands and powerful hips, to be sure, but they
must also possess the power of wu wei, or nonaction.
Wu wei is the ability to hold the bat back—waiting until the batter
sees the perfect pitch. It is the yogi in meditation. They’re physically
still, so that they can be active on a mental and spiritual level. That
was also Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It might have
seemed like he wasn’t doing enough—that he wasn’t rushing to
destroy his opponent—but he was rightly carving out the space and
time to think, and time and space for the Russians to do the same
thing. Practicing wu wei was precisely what Tiger Woods lost the
ability to do as his work and sex addictions took control.
A disciplined action, that’s what John Cage called doing nothing
in the performance instructions on 4′33″.
You don’t solve a maze by rushing through. You have to stop and
think. You have to walk slowly and carefully, reining in your energy—
otherwise you’ll get hopelessly lost. The same is true for the problems
we face in life.
The green light is a powerful symbol in our culture. We forget
what Mr. Rogers was trying to make us see—that the yellow light and
the red light are just as important. Slow down. Stop. One recent
study found that subjects would rather give themselves an electric
shock than experience boredom for even a few minutes. Then we
wonder why people do so many stupid things.
There is a haunting clip of Joan Rivers, well into her seventies,
already one of the most accomplished and respected and talented
comedians of all time, in which she is asked why she keeps working,
why she is always on the road, always looking for more gigs. Telling
the interviewer about the fear that drives her, she holds up an empty
calendar. “If my book ever looked like this, it would mean that
nobody wants me, that everything I ever tried to do in life didn’t
work. Nobody cared and I’ve been totally forgotten.”
It’s not just that there was never enough for Joan. It’s that our
best and most lasting work comes from when we take things slow.
When we pick our shots and wait for the right pitches.
Somebody who thinks they’re nothing and don’t matter because
they’re not doing something for even a few days is depriving

themselves of stillness, yes—but they are also closing themselves off
from a higher plane of performance that comes out of it.
Spiritually, that’s hard. Physically, it’s harder still. You have to
make yourself say no. You have to make yourself not take the stage.
A weaker Fabius would not have been able to resist attacking
Hannibal, and all of history might have turned out differently. A
long-distance runner who can’t pace himself. A money manager who
can’t wait out a bear market. If they can’t learn the art of wu wei in
their professions, they won’t succeed. If you can’t do it in your life,
forget about success, you’ll burn out your body. And you don’t get
another one of those!
We should look fearfully, even sympathetically, at the people who
have become slaves to their calendars, who require a staff of ten to
handle all their ongoing projects, whose lives seem to resemble a
fugitive fleeing one scene for the next. There is no stillness there. It’s
servitude.
Each of us needs to get better at saying no. As in, “No, sorry, I’m
not available.” “No, sorry, that sounds great but I’d rather not.” “No,
I’m going to wait and see.” “No, I don’t like that idea.” “No, I don’t
need that—I’m going to make the most of what I have.” “No, because
if I said yes to you, I’d have to say yes to everyone.”
Maybe it’s not the most virtuous thing to say “No, sorry, I can’t”
when you really can but just don’t want to. But can you really? Can
you really afford to do it? And does it not harm other people if you’re
constantly stretched too thin?
A pilot gets to say, “Sorry, I’m on standby,” as an excuse to get out
of things. Doctors and firemen and police officers get to use being
“on call” as a shield. But are we not on call in our own lives? Isn’t
there something (or someone) that we’re preserving our full
capacities for? Are our own bodies not on call for our families, for
our self-improvement, for our own work?
Always think about what you’re really being asked to give.
Because the answer is often a piece of your life, usually in exchange
for something you don’t even want. Remember, that’s what time is.
It’s your life, it’s your flesh and blood, that you can never get back.
In every situation ask:

What is it?
Why does it matter?
Do I need it?
Do I want it?
What are the hidden costs?
Will I look back from the distant future and be glad I did it?
If I never knew about it at all—if the request was lost in the mail,
if they hadn’t been able to pin me down to ask me—would I
even notice that I missed out?
When we know what to say no to, we can say yes to the things
that matter.

TAKE A WALK

It is only ideas gained from walking that have any
worth.
—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

N

early every afternoon the citizens of Copenhagen were treated to
the strange sight of Søren Kierkegaard walking the streets. The
cantankerous philosopher would write in the morning at a standing
desk, and then around noon would head out onto the busy streets of
the city.
He walked on the newfangled “sidewalks” that had been built for
fashionable citizens to stroll along. He walked through the city’s
parks and along the pathways of Assistens Cemetery, where he would
later be buried. On occasion, he walked out past the city’s walls and
into the countryside. Kierkegaard never seemed to walk straight—he
zigged and zagged, crossing the street without notice, trying to
always remain in the shade. When he had either worn himself out,
worked through what he was struggling with, or been struck with a
good idea, he would turn around and make for home, where he
would write for the rest of the day.
Seeing Kierkegaard out walking surprised the residents of
Copenhagen, because he seemed, at least from his writings, to be
such a high-strung individual. They weren’t wrong. Walking was how
he released the stress and frustration that his philosophical
explorations inevitably created.

In a beautiful letter to his sister-in-law, who was often bedridden,
and depressed as a result, Kierkegaard wrote of the importance of
walking. “Above all,” he told her in 1847, “do not lose your desire to
walk: Every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk
away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts,
and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away
from it.”
Kierkegaard believed that sitting still was a kind of breeding
ground for illness. But walking, movement, to him was almost
sacred. It cleansed the soul and cleared the mind in a way that
primed his explorations as a philosopher. Life is a path, he liked to
say, we have to walk it.
And while Kierkegaard was particularly eloquent in his writing
about walking, he was by no means alone in his dedication to the
practice—nor alone in reaping the benefits. Nietzsche said that the
ideas in Thus Spoke Zarathustra came to him on a long walk. Nikola
Tesla discovered the rotating magnetic field, one of the most
important scientific discoveries of all time, on a walk through a city
park in Budapest in 1882. When he lived in Paris, Ernest Hemingway
would take long walks along the quais whenever he was stuck in his
writing and needed to clarify his thinking. Charles Darwin’s daily
schedule included several walks, as did those of Steve Jobs and the
groundbreaking psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman,
the latter of whom wrote that “I did the best thinking of my life on
leisurely walks with Amos.” It was the physical activity in the body,
Kahneman said, that got his brain going.
When Martin Luther King Jr. was a seminary student at Crozer,
he took an hour walk each day through the campus woods to
“commune with nature.” Walt Whitman and Ulysses S. Grant often
bumped into each other on their respective walks around
Washington, which cleared their minds and helped them think.
Perhaps it was that experience that Whitman was writing about in
this verse of “Song of Myself”:
Know’st thou the joys of pensive thought?
Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?

Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow’d yet proud, the
suffering and the struggle?
Freud was known for his speedy walks around Vienna’s
Ringstrasse after his evening meal. The composer Gustav Mahler
spent as much as four hours a day walking, using this time to work
through and jot down ideas. Ludwig van Beethoven carried sheet
music and a writing utensil with him on his walks for the same
reason. Dorothy Day was a lifelong walker, and it was on her strolls
along the beach on Staten Island in the 1920s that she first began to
feel a strong sense of God in her life and the first flickerings of the
awakening that would put her on a path toward sainthood. It’s
probably not a coincidence that Jesus himself was a walker—a
traveler—who knew the pleasures and the divineness of putting one
foot in front of the other.
How does walking get us closer to stillness? Isn’t the whole point
of what we’re talking about to reduce activity, not seek it out? Yes, we
are in motion when we walk, but it is not frenzied motion or even
conscious motion—it is repetitive, ritualized motion. It is deliberate.
It is an exercise in peace.
The Buddhists talk of “walking meditation,” or kinhin, where the
movement after a long session of sitting, particularly movement
through a beautiful setting, can unlock a different kind of stillness
than traditional meditation. Indeed, forest bathing—and most
natural beauty—can only be accomplished by getting out of your
house or office or car and trekking out into the woods on foot.
The key to a good walk is to be aware. To be present and open to
the experience. Put your phone away. Put the pressing problems of
your life away, or rather let them melt away as you move. Look down
at your feet. What are they doing? Notice how effortlessly they move.
Is it you who’s doing that? Or do they just sort of move on their own?
Listen to the sound of the leaves crunching underfoot. Feel the
ground pushing back against you.
Breathe in. Breathe out. Consider who might have walked this
very spot in the centuries before you. Consider the person who paved
the asphalt you are standing on. What was going on with them?

Where are they now? What did they believe? What problems did they
have?
When you feel the tug of your responsibilities or the desire to
check in with the outside world, push yourself a bit further. If you’re
on a path you have trod before, take a sudden turn down a street or
up a hill where you haven’t been before. Feel the unfamiliarity and
the newness of these surroundings, drink in what you have not yet
tasted.
Get lost. Be unreachable. Go slowly.
It’s an affordable luxury available to us all. Even the poorest
pauper can go for a nice walk—in a national park or an empty
parking lot.
This isn’t about burning calories or getting your heart rate up. On
the contrary, it’s not about anything. It is instead just a
manifestation, an embodiment of the concepts of presence, of
detachment, of emptying the mind, of noticing and appreciating the
beauty of the world around you. Walk away from the thoughts that
need to be walked away from; walk toward the ones that have now
appeared.
On a good walk, the mind is not completely blank. It can’t be—
otherwise you might trip over a root or get hit by a car or a bicyclist.
The point is not, as in traditional meditation, to push every thought
or observation from your mind. On the contrary, the whole point is
to see what’s around you. The mind might be active while you do
this, but it is still. It’s a different kind of thinking, a healthier kind if
you do it right. A study at New Mexico Highlands University has
found that the force from our footsteps can increase the supply of
blood to the brain. Researchers at Stanford have found that walkers
perform better on tests that measure “creative divergent thinking”
during and after their walks. A study out of Duke University found a
version of what Kierkegaard tried to tell his sister-in-law, that
walking could be as effective a treatment for major depression in
some patients as medication.
The poet William Wordsworth walked as many as 180,000 miles
in his lifetime—an average of six and a half miles a day since he was
five years old! He did much of his writing while walking, usually
around Grasmere, a lake in the English countryside, or Rydal Water,

which is not far from Grasmere. On these long walks, as lines of
poetry came to him, Wordsworth would repeat them over and over
again, since it might be hours until he had the chance to write them
down. Biographers have wondered ever since: Was it the scenery that
inspired the images of his poems or was it the movement that jogged
the thoughts? Every ordinary person who has ever had a
breakthrough on a walk knows that the two forces are equally and
magically responsible.
In our own search for beauty and what is good in life, we would
do well to head outside and wander around. In an attempt to unlock
a deeper part of our consciousness and access a high level of our
mind, we would do well to get our body moving and our blood
flowing.
Stress and difficulty can knock us down. Sitting at our computers,
we are overwhelmed with information, with emails, with one thing
after another. Should we just sit there and absorb it? Should we sit
there with the sickness and let it fester? No. Should we get up and
throw ourselves into some other project—constructive, like cleaning,
or cathartic, like picking a fight? No. We shouldn’t do any of that.
We should get walking.
Kierkegaard tells the story of a morning when he was driven from
his house in a state of despair and frustration—illness, in his words.
After an hour and a half, he was finally at peace and nearly back
home when he bumped into a friendly gentleman who chattered on
about a number of his problems. Isn’t that how it always seems to
go?
No matter. “There was only one thing left for me to do,”
Kierkegaard wrote, “instead of going home, to go walking again.”
And so must we.
Walk.
Then walk some more.

BUILD A ROUTINE

If a person puts even one measure of effort into
following ritual and the standards of righteousness, he
will get back twice as much.
—XUNZI

E

ach and every morning, Fred Rogers woke up at 5 a.m. to spend a
quiet hour in reflection and prayer. Then he would head to the
Pittsburgh Athletic Club, where he would swim his morning laps. As
he walked out to the pool he would weigh himself—it was important
that he always weigh 143 pounds—and as he jumped in, he would
sing “Jubilate Deo” to himself. He emerged from that pool as if
baptized anew each day, a friend wrote, fresh and fully prepared for
the workday ahead.
When he got to the set of his television show, the next part of the
ritual began, one that was recorded for posterity in identical fashion
over hundreds of episodes, year after year. The theme song starts.
The yellow light flashes. The camera pans to the front door. Mr.
Rogers enters, singing, and walks down the stairs. He takes off his
jacket and neatly hangs it up in the closet. He puts on and zips up his
trademark cardigan—the one his mother made him. Then he takes
off his shoes and puts on a comfortable pair of boat slippers. Now,
and only now, can he begin to speak and teach to his favorite people
in the world—the children of his neighborhood.
To some, this might seem monotonous. The same routine, day in
and day out, that extended beyond “Cut!” at the end of each show to

an afternoon nap, dinner with his family, and a 9:30 bedtime. The
same weight. The same food. The same introduction. The same close
to the day. Boring? The truth is that a good routine is not only a
source of great comfort and stability, it’s the platform from which
stimulating and fulfilling work is possible.
Routine, done for long enough and done sincerely enough,
becomes more than routine. It becomes ritual—it becomes sanctified
and holy.
Maybe Mr. Rogers isn’t your thing. Perhaps, then, you’d rather
look at the perennial all-star point guard Russell Westbrook, who
begins his own routine exactly three hours before tipoff. First, he
warms up. Then, one hour before the game, Westbrook visits the
arena chapel. Then he eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
(always buttered wheat bread, toasted, strawberry jelly, Skippy
peanut butter, cut diagonally). At exactly six minutes and seventeen
seconds before the game starts, he begins the team’s final warm-up
drill. He has a particular pair of shoes for games, for practice, for
road games. Since high school, he’s done the same thing after
shooting a free throw, walking backward past the three-point line
and then forward again to take the next shot. At the practice facility,
he has a specific parking space, and he likes to shoot on Practice
Court 3. He calls his parents at the same time every day. And on and
on.
Sports is filled with stories like Westbrook’s. They often feature
goalies in hockey, pitchers in baseball, quarterbacks and placekickers
in football—the most cerebral positions in their respective games.
Players who engage in this kind of behavior are called quirky, and
their routines are called superstitions. It’s strange to us that these
successful people, who are more or less their own boss and are
clearly so talented, seem prisoners to the regimentation of their
routines. Isn’t the whole point of greatness that you’re freed from
trivial rules and regulations? That you can do whatever you want?
Ah, but the greats know that complete freedom is a nightmare.
They know that order is a prerequisite of excellence and that in an
unpredictable world, good habits are a safe haven of certainty.
It was Eisenhower who defined freedom as the opportunity for
self-discipline. In fact, freedom and power and success require self-

discipline. Because without it, chaos and complacency move in.
Discipline, then, is how we maintain that freedom.
It’s also how we get in the right headspace to do our work. The
writer and runner Haruki Murakami talks about why he follows the
same routine every day. “The repetition itself becomes the important
thing,” he says, “it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to
reach a deeper state of mind.”
When our thoughts are empty and our body is in its groove, we do
our best work.
A routine can be time-based. Jack Dorsey, the founder and CEO
of Twitter, gets up at 5 a.m., without fail. The former Navy SEAL
Jocko Willink gets up at 4:30 a.m. and posts a picture of his watch to
prove it each morning. Queen Victoria woke at 8 a.m., ate breakfast
at 10, and met with her ministers from 11 to 11:30. The poet John
Milton was up at 4 a.m. to read and contemplate, so that by 7 a.m. he
was ready to be “milked” by his writing.
A routine can be focused on order or arrangement. Confucius
insisted that his mat be straight or he would not sit. Jim
Schlossnagle, the baseball coach who took over TCU’s team after a
long run of mediocre play, taught his players to keep their lockers, as
well as the dugout, spotless and orderly at all times (the team has
never had a losing season since and made it to four straight College
World Series). The ordering also matters to tennis great Rafael
Nadal, who drinks water and a recovery drink in the same order and
then sets them in a perfect arrangement.
Routine can be built around a tool or a sound or a scent. Rilke
had two pens and two kinds of paper on his desk; one was used for
writing, while the other was acceptable for bills, letters, and less
important documents. Monks are called to meditation by the
chiming of a monastery bell; other monks rub a zuko incense on their
hands before ceremonies and meditations.
A routine can also be religious or faith-based. Confucius always
gave a sacrificial offering before eating, no matter how
inconsequential the meal was. The Greeks consulted the Delphic
oracle before any major decision and made sacrifices before battle.
The Jews have kept the Sabbath for thousands of years, Abad Ha’am
once said, just as the Sabbath has kept the Jews.

Done enough times, done with sincerity and feeling, routine
becomes ritual. The regularity of it—the daily cadence—creates deep
and meaningful experience. To one person, taking care of a horse is a
chore. To Simón Bolívar it was a sacred, essential part of his day.
When the body is busy with the familiar, the mind can relax. The
monotony becomes muscle memory. To deviate seems dangerous,
wrong. As if it’s inviting failure in.
Some might sneer at this “superstitious” behavior, but that is the
wrong way to think about it. As Rafael Nadal explained, “If it were
superstition, why would I keep doing the same thing over and over
whether I win or lose? It’s a way of placing myself in a match,
ordering my surroundings to match the order I seek in my head.” Did
the Greeks really believe that the oracle of Delphi could tell them
what they should do? Or was the consultation process, the journey to
Mount Parnassus, the whole point?
Sociologists found that island tribes were more prone to create
rituals for activities where luck was a factor than where it wasn’t,
such as fishing on the open sea compared to on a lagoon. The truth
is, luck is always in play for us. Luck is always a factor.
The purpose of ritual isn’t to win the gods over to our side
(though that can’t hurt!). It’s to settle our bodies (and our minds)
down when Fortune is our opponent on the other side of the net.
Most people wake up to face the day as an endless barrage of
bewildering and overwhelming choices, one right after another.
What do I wear? What should I eat? What should I do first? What
should I do after that? What sort of work should I do? Should I
scramble to address this problem or rush to put out this fire?
Needless to say, this is exhausting. It is a whirlwind of conflicting
impulses, incentives, inclinations, and external interruptions. It is no
path to stillness and hardly a way to get the best out of yourself.
The psychologist William James spoke about making habits our
ally instead of our enemy. That we can build around us a day and a
life that is moral and ordered and still—and in so doing, create a kind
of bulwark against the chaos of the world and free up the best of
ourselves for the work we do.

For this, we must make automatic and habitual, as early as
possible, as many useful actions as we can, and guard
against the growing into ways that are likely to be
disadvantageous to us, as we should guard against the
plague. The more of the details of our daily life we can
hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the
more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their
own proper work. There is no more miserable human
being than one in whom nothing is habitual but
indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the
drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed
every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are
subjects of express volitional deliberation.
When we not only automate and routinize the trivial parts of life,
but also make automatic good and virtuous decisions, we free up
resources to do important and meaningful exploration. We buy room
for peace and stillness, and thus make good work and good thoughts
accessible and inevitable.
To make that possible, you must go now and get your house in
order. Get your day scheduled. Limit the interruptions. Limit the
number of choices you need to make.
If you can do this, passion and disturbance will give you less
trouble. Because it will find itself boxed out.
For inspiration, take as your model Japanese flower arrangers:
Orderly. Quiet. Focused. Clean. Fresh. Deliberate. You will not find
them trying to practice in noisy coffee shops or bleary-eyed in a rush
at 3 a.m. because they planned poorly. You will not find them picking
up their trimmers on a whim, or in their underwear while they talk
on the phone to an old friend who has just called. All of that is too
random, too chaotic for the true master.
A master is in control. A master has a system. A master turns the
ordinary into the sacred.
And so must we.

GET RID OF YOUR STUFF

For property is poverty and fear; only to have
possessed something and to have let go of it means
carefree ownership.
—RAINER MARIA RILKE

E

pictetus was born a slave but eventually received his freedom. In
time, he came to enjoy the trappings of the good life—or at least
the Stoic version of it. He had emperors attend his lectures, trained
many students, and made a decent living. With his hard-earned
money, he bought a nice iron lamp, which he kept burning in a small
shrine in his home.
One evening, he heard a noise in the hallway by his front door.
Rushing down, he found that a thief had stolen the prized lamp. Like
any person who feels attached to their stuff, he was disappointed and
surprised and violated. Someone had come into his home and stolen
something that belonged to him.
But then Epictetus caught himself. He remembered his teachings.
“Tomorrow, my friend,” he said to himself, “you will find an
earthenware lamp; for a man can only lose what he has.” For the rest
of his life, he kept this cheaper earthen lamp instead. Upon his death,
an admirer, entirely missing the point of Epictetus’s disdain for
material items, purchased it for 3,000 drachmas.
One of Seneca’s most powerful metaphors is the slaveowner
owned by his slaves, or the wealthy man whose vast estates lord over
him rather than the other way around (in modern times, we have our

own term for this: being “house poor”). Montaigne was perceptive
enough to ask whether it was in fact he who was the pet of his cat.
We also find a version of it from the East. Xunzi explained:
The gentleman makes things his servants. The petty man
is servant to things.
In short, mental and spiritual independence matter little if the
things we own in the physical world end up owning us.
The Cynics took this idea the furthest. Diogenes supposedly lived
in a barrel and walked around nearly naked. When he saw a child
drinking water from a well with his hands, Diogenes smashed his
own cup, realizing that he had been carrying around an extraneous
possession.
Today, we might call Diogenes a bum or a loser (or a crazy
person), and in some sense he was those things. But on the few
occasions when Diogenes met Alexander the Great, then the most
powerful man in the world, it was Diogenes who observers came
away thinking was the more impressive. Because Alexander, as much
as he tried, could neither tempt Diogenes with any favors nor deprive
him of anything that he had not already willingly tossed aside.
There was nothing but a shirt between the Stoics and the Cynics,
joked the poet Juvenal, meaning the Stoics were sensible enough to
wear clothes (and refrain from bodily functions in public), unlike the
Cynics. This is a pretty reasonable concession. We don’t need to get
rid of all our possessions, but we should constantly question what we
own, why we own it, and whether we could do without.
Have you ever seen a house torn down? A lifetime of earning and
savings, countless hours of decorating and accumulating until it was
arranged just right, the place of so much living—and in the end it is
reduced to a couple dumpsters full of debris. Even the incredibly
wealthy, even the heads of state showered with gifts throughout their
life, would only fill a few more bins.
Yet how many of us collect and acquire as if the metric tonnage of
our possessions is a comment on our worth as individuals? Just as
every hoarder becomes trapped by their own garbage, so too are we

tied down by what we own. Every piece of expensive jewelry comes
with an insurance bill, every mansion with a staff of groundskeepers,
every investment with obligations and monthly statements to review,
every exotic pet and plant with a set of responsibilities. F. Scott
Fitzgerald said that the rich are different than us, and his novels
portray them as free and without care.
That’s not quite right.
Mo’ money, mo’ problems, and also mo’ stuff, less freedom.
John Boyd, a sort of warrior-monk who revolutionized Western
military strategy in the latter half of the twentieth century, refused to
take checks from defense contractors and deliberately lived in a
small condo even as he advised presidents and generals. “If a man
can reduce his needs to zero,” he said, “he is truly free: there is
nothing that can be taken from him and nothing anyone can do to
hurt him.” To that we would add, “And he or she can also be still.”
No one dogged by creditors is free. Living outside your means—as
Churchill could attest—is not glamorous. Behind the appearances,
it’s exhausting.
It’s also dangerous. The person who is afraid to lose their stuff,
who has their identity wrapped up in their things, gives their
enemies an opening. They make themselves extra vulnerable to fate.
The playwright Tennessee Williams spoke of luxury as the “wolf
at the door.” It wasn’t the possessions that were the problem, he said,
but the dependency. He called it the catastrophe of success, the way
that we become less and less able to do things ourselves, the more
and more we cannot be without a certain level of service. Not only is
all your stuff a mess, but you need to pay someone to come clean it
up.
There is also what we can term “comfort creep.” We get so used to
a certain level of convenience and luxury that it becomes almost
inconceivable that we used to live without it. As wealth grows, so
does our sense of “normal.” But just a few years ago we were fine
without this bounty. We had no problem eating ramen or squeezing
into a small apartment. But now that we have more, our mind begins
to lie to us. You need this. Be anxious that you might lose it. Protect
it. Don’t share.
It’s toxic and scary.

Which is why philosophers have always advocated reducing our
needs and limiting our possessions. Monks and priests take vows of
poverty because it will mean fewer distractions, and more room
(literally) for the spiritual pursuit to which they have committed. No
one is saying we have to go that far, but the more we own, the more
we oversee, the less room we have to move and, ironically, the less
still we become.
Start by walking around your house and filling up trash bags and
boxes with everything you don’t use. Think of it as clearing more
room for your mind and your body. Give yourself space. Give your
mind a rest. Want to have less to be mad about? Less to covet or be
triggered by? Give more away.
The best car is not the one that turns the most heads, but the one
you have to worry about the least. The best clothes are the ones that
are the most comfortable, that require you to spend the least amount
of time shopping—regardless of what the magazines say. The best
house for you is the one that feels the most like home. Don’t use your
money to purchase loneliness, or headaches, or status anxiety.
Your grandmother did not give you that brooch so that you would
constantly worry about losing it. The artist who produced the
painting on your wall was not working hard so that you might one
day fear that a guest would damage it. Nor is the memory of that
beautiful summer in Anguilla actually contained in that carved statue
or the love you share with your spouse limited to the photograph of
the two of you at your wedding. The memory is what’s important.
The experience itself is what matters. You can access that anytime
you want, and no thief can ever deprive you of it.
You will hear people say they don’t have room for a relationship
in their life . . . and they’re right. Their stuff is taking up too much
space. They’re in love with possessions instead of people.
The family who never see each other because the two parents are
working late to pay off the extra bedrooms they never use? The fame
that keeps someone on the road so much they’re a stranger to their
kids? The supposed “technology” that is a pain in the ass to figure
out, that’s always breaking? The fragile, fancy possessions that we’re
constantly cleaning, buffing, protecting, and trying to find ways to
slyly mention in conversation?

This is not a rich life. There is no peace in this.
Take action. Get out from under all your stuff. Get rid of it. Give
away what you don’t need.
You were born free—free of stuff, free of burden. But since the
first time they measured your tiny body for clothes, people have been
foisting stuff upon you. And you’ve been adding links to the pile of
chains yourself ever since.

SEEK SOLITUDE

A crowded world thinks that aloneness is always
loneliness and that to seek it is perversion.
—JOHN GRAVES

I

t was a habit of Leonardo da Vinci’s to write little fables to himself
in his notebooks. One tells the story of a good-sized stone that
rested in a pleasant grove, surrounded by flowers, perched above a
busy country road. Despite this peaceful existence, the stone grew
restless. “What am I doing among these herbs?” he asked. “I want to
live in the company of my fellow stones.”
Unhappy and alone, the stone contrived to roll itself down the hill
onto the road, where it would be surrounded by countless other
stones. But the change was not quite as wonderful as expected. Down
in the dirt, the stone was trod on by horses, driven over by wagons,
and stepped on by people. It was alternately covered in mud and
feces, and chipped at and jostled and moved—painful moments made
all the more painful by the occasional sight the stone was given of its
old home, and the solitary peace it had left behind.
Not content to leave the story at that, Leonardo felt the need to
put a fine point on it. “This is what happens,” he wrote to himself and
every one of us, “to those who leave the solitary and contemplative
life and choose to live in cities among people full of countless evils.”
Of course, Leonardo’s biographers were quick to point out that
the author didn’t always follow the lesson of this fable. He spent
most of his life in Florence and Milan and Rome. He painted in a

busy studio and attended many spectacles and parties. Even his last
years were spent not in secluded retirement but in the bustling court
of King Francis I of France.
His occupation required this. As do many of ours.
Which makes cultivating moments of solitude all the more
essential. To find solitude, the way Eugen Herrigel said that the
Buddhist does, “not in far-off, quiet places; he creates it out of
himself, spreads it around him wherever he may be, because he loves
it.”
While Leonardo was working on The Last Supper, he would get
up early and arrive at the monastery before any of his assistants or
spectators, so he could be alone, in silence, with his thoughts and the
mammoth creative challenge in front of him. He was also notorious
for leaving his studio and going for long walks by himself, carrying a
notebook and simply looking and watching and really seeing what
was happening around him. He loved to visit his uncle’s farm for
inspiration and solitude.
It is difficult to think clearly in rooms filled with other people. It’s
difficult to understand yourself if you are never by yourself. It’s
difficult to have much in the way of clarity and insight if your life is a
constant party and your home is a construction site.
Sometimes you have to disconnect in order to better connect with
yourself and with the people you serve and love.
“If I was to sum up the single biggest problem of senior
leadership in the Information Age,” four-star Marine Corps general
and former secretary of defense James Mattis has said, “it’s lack of
reflection. Solitude allows you to reflect while others are reacting. We
need solitude to refocus on prospective decision-making, rather than
just reacting to problems as they arise.”
People don’t have enough silence in their lives because they don’t
have enough solitude. And they don’t get enough solitude because
they don’t seek out or cultivate silence. It’s a vicious cycle that
prevents stillness and reflection, and then stymies good ideas, which
are almost always hatched in solitude.
Breakthroughs seem to happen with stunning regularity in the
shower or on a long hike. Where don’t they happen? Shouting to be
heard in a bar. Three hours into a television binge. Nobody realizes

just how much they love someone while they’re booking back-to
back-to-back meetings.
If solitude is the school of genius, as the historian Edward Gibbon
put it, then the crowded, busy world is the purgatory of the idiot.
Who isn’t stiller in the morning, or when they’re up before the
house stirs, before the phone rings or the commutes have begun?
Who isn’t better equipped to notice the meaning of the moment
when it’s quiet, when your personal space is being respected? In
solitude time slows down, and while we might find that speed hard to
bear at first, we will ultimately go crazy without this check on the
busyness of life and work. And if not driven crazy, we will certainly
miss out.
Solitude is not just for hermits, but for healthy, functioning
people. Although there is a thing or two we can learn about solitude
from the people who turned pro at it.
In 1941, then just twenty-six years old, Thomas Merton reported
to the Abbey of Gethsemani in Bardstown, Kentucky, and began his
first of many journeys into monkish solitude that would go on, in
various forms, for the next twenty-seven years. His solitude was
hardly indolent repose. It was instead an active exploration of
himself, of religion, of human nature, and later, into solving serious
societal problems like inequality, war, and injustice. In his beautiful
journals, we find insights into the human experience that would have
been impossible if Merton had spent his time in a newspaper bullpen
or even on a university campus.
He would come to call solitude his vocation. As he wrote:
To pray and work in the morning and to labor and rest in
the afternoon, and to sit still again in meditation in the
evening when night falls upon that land and when the
silence fills itself with darkness and with stars. This is a
true and special vocation. There are few who are willing to
belong completely to such silence, to let it soak into their
bones, to breathe nothing but silence, to feed on silence,
and to turn the very substance of their life into a living and
vigilant silence.

In a more emulatable form of Merton’s retreat, Microsoft founder
and philanthropist Bill Gates has, twice a year for many years now,
taken what he calls a “think week.” He spends seven days alone in a
cabin in the forest. There, physically removing himself from the daily
interruptions of his work, he can really sit down and think.
He might be alone there, but he is hardly lonely. Gates reads—
sometimes hundreds of papers—quietly for hours at a time,
sometimes in print, sometimes off computer monitors that look out
over the water. He reads books too, in a library adorned with a
portrait of the author Victor Hugo. He writes long memos to people
across his organization. The only breaks he takes are a few minutes
to play bridge or go for a walk. In those solitary days in that cabin,
Gates is the picture of Thomas à Kempis’s line In omnibus requiem
quaesivi, et nusquam inveni nisi in angulo cum libro—“Everywhere I
have sought peace and not found it, except in a corner with a book.”
Do not mistake this for some kind of vacation. It is hard work—
long days, some without sleep. It is wrestling with complex topics,
contradictory ideas, and identity-challenging concepts. But despite
this struggle, Gates emerges recharged and refocused. He can see
further into the distance. He knows what he wants to prioritize, what
to assign his people to work on. He carries the quiet stillness of the
woods back to the complicated world he has to navigate as a
businessman and philanthropic leader.
Each of us needs to put ourselves, physically, in the position to do
that kind of deep work. We need to give our bodies, as Virginia Woolf
put it, a room of our own—even if only for a few stolen hours—where
we can think and have quiet and solitude. Buddha needed seclusion
in his search for enlightenment. He had to step away from the world,
go off by himself, and sit.
Don’t you think you would benefit from that too?
It’s hard to make that time. It’s hard (and expensive) to get away.
We have responsibilities. But they will be better for our temporary
disappearance. We will carry back with us the stillness from our
solitude in the form of patience, understanding, gratitude, and
insight.
In Leonardo’s fable, the stone abandoned the peaceful solitude of
the meadow for the road and came to regret it. Merton, for his part,

came to occasionally regret his complete solitude. Was there more he
could do as a man of the world? Could he have a bigger impact if he
abandoned his solitude?
Indeed, very few of us are willing or able to make it the totality of
our existence, nor should we. (The dancer Twyla Tharp points out
that “solitude without purpose” is a killer of creativity.) Even in
Merton’s case, he was given special privileges from his church
superior to communicate with the outside world through letters and
writing, and eventually began to travel and speak to large crowds.
Because his work was too important and the insights he discovered
were too essential to remain locked up in a tiny brick house on the
edge of the woods in Kentucky.
Merton eventually came to understand that after so much time by
himself in the woods, he now possessed solitude inside himself—and
could access it anytime he liked. The wise and busy also learn that
solitude and stillness are there in pockets, if we look for them. The
few minutes before going onstage for a talk or sitting in your hotel
room before a meeting. The morning before the rest of the house
wakes up. Or late in the evening after the world has gone to sleep.
Grab these moments. Schedule them. Cultivate them.

BE A HUMAN BEING

Work is what horses die of. Everybody should know
that.
—ALEKSANDR SOLZHENITSYN

C

ompared with most royal couples, Queen Victoria and Prince
Consort Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha were exceptional. They
actually loved each other and they actually worked at, and took
seriously, their jobs as heads of state. This was all very good.
But it could also be argued that any positive trait—even hard
work—taken to excess becomes a vice.
In both their cases, as a couple for whom, by the nature of their
profession, even the idea of “work/life balance” was impossible, the
virtue of their self-discipline and dedication became a fatal vice.
Albert, a Bavarian prince who married into the British royal
family, was a hard worker from the day he married Victoria. He
brought much-needed order and routine to the life of his queen. He
streamlined processes and took up a share of the burdens that had
previously fallen on Victoria alone. Indeed, many of the so-called
Victorian traits of the era originated with him. He was disciplined,
fastidious, ambitious, conservative.
Under his pressing, their schedule became one meeting, dispatch,
and social event after another. Albert was almost constantly busy,
working so much that he occasionally vomited from stress. Never
shirking a responsibility or an opportunity, he took on every bit of
the burden of power his wife was willing to share, and in turn,

together they seized every formal and informal bit of influence the
monarchy had in the British Empire at that time. They were a pair of
workaholics and proud of it.
As Albert wrote to an advisor, he spent hours a day reading
newspapers in German, French, and English. “One can let nothing
pass,” he said, “without losing the connection and coming in
consequence to wrong conclusions.” He was right, the stakes were
certainly high. For instance, his expert understanding of geopolitics
helped Britain avoid being drawn into the U.S. Civil War.
But the truth was, Albert threw himself equally hard into projects
of much less importance. Organizing the Great Exhibition of 1851, a
nearly six-month-long carnival that showed off the wonders of the
British Empire, consumed years of his life. A few days before it
opened, he wrote to his stepmother, “I am more dead than alive from
overwork.” It was, to be certain, a beautiful and memorable event,
but his health never recovered.
He was like Winston Churchill, only he and his wife knew no
moderation and had little fun. “I go on working at my treadmill, as
life seems to me,” Albert said. It’s not a bad description of the
exhausting and repetitive life he and Victoria led. Starting in 1840,
Victoria bore nine children in seventeen years, four of whom were
born in consecutive years. In a time when women still regularly died
during childbirth (anesthesia—chloroform— became available only
for her eighth pregnancy), Victoria, who was a mere five feet tall, was
constantly pregnant. Even with the benefits of limitless household
help, she bore an enormous physical burden on top of her duties as
queen. Upon her death, it was found that she was suffering from a
prolapsed uterus and a hernia that must have caused her incredible
and constant pain.
There’s nothing wrong with having a large family—the throne did
need heirs—but it never seemed to have occurred to the couple that
they had any say in the matter. “Man is a beast of burden,” Albert
wrote to his brother, “and he is only happy if he has to drag his
burden and if he has little free will. My experience teaches me every
day to understand the truth of this more and more.” As a result, his
and Victoria’s existence was hardly one of privilege or relaxation or
freedom. It was instead an endless cycle of obligation after

obligation, done at a breakneck pace that the two of them inflicted on
themselves.
It is a testament to their affection for each other that their
marriage survived. Victoria was at least aware of the deleterious
effects all this work had on Albert. She wrote of the consequences of
his “over-love of business” on their relationship, and she also noticed
that his health was flagging. His racing mind kept him awake at
night, his stomach cramped, and his skin drooped.
Instead of listening to these warning signs, he soldiered on for
years, working harder and harder, forcing his body to comply. And
then, suddenly, in 1861, it quit on him. His strength failed. He drifted
into incoherency, and at 10:50 p.m. on December 14, Albert took his
three final breaths and died. The cause? Crohn’s disease, exacerbated
by extreme stress. He had literally worked his guts out.
Modern medicine has hardly saved us from these tragedies. In
Japan they have a word, karōshi, which translates to death from
overwork. In Korean it’s gwarosa.
Is that what you want to be? A workhorse that draws its load until
it collapses and dies, still shod and in the harness? Is that what you
were put on this planet for?
Remember, the main cause of injury for elite athletes is not
tripping and falling. It’s not collisions. It’s overuse. Pitchers and
quarterbacks throw out their arms. Basketball players blow out their
knees. Others just get tired of the grinding hours and the pressure.
Michael Phelps prematurely ended his swimming career due to
burnout—despite all the gold medals, he never wanted to get in a
pool again. It’s hard to blame him either; he’d put everything,
including his own sanity and health, second to shaving seconds off
his times.
Meanwhile, Eliud Kipchoge, possibly the greatest distance runner
ever to live, actively works to make sure he is not overworking. In
training, he deliberately does not give his full effort, saving that
instead for the few times per year when he races. He prefers instead
to train at 80 percent of his capacity—on occasion to 90 percent—to
maintain and preserve his longevity (and sanity) as an athlete. When
Michael Phelps came back to swimming after his breakdown in 2012,

it was possible because he was willing to reimagine his approach to
training and to approach it with more balance.
Pacing is something athletes are often forced to come to terms
with as they age, while young athletes needlessly burn themselves
out because they think they have a bottomless well of energy. Yes,
there is purity and meaning in giving your best to whatever you do—
but life is much more of a marathon than it is a sprint. In a way, this
is the distinction between confidence and ego. Can you trust yourself
and your abilities enough to keep something in reserve? Can you
protect the stillness and the inner peace necessary to win the longer
race of life?
It was a malicious lie that the Nazis hung over the gates of
Auschwitz: Arbeit macht frei—“Work will set you free.”*
No. No. No.
The Russian proverb had it better: Work just makes you bent
over.
Man is not a beast of burden. Yes, we have important duties—to
our country, to our coworkers, to provide for our families. Many of us
have talents and gifts that are so extraordinary that we owe it to
ourselves and the world to express and fulfill them. But we’re not
going to be able to do that if we’re not taking care of ourselves, or if
we have stretched ourselves to the breaking point.
The moral of the American tall tale about the rail worker John
Henry is often lost on people. He challenges the steam-powered
drilling machine, and through sheer strength and inhuman will, he
beats it. It’s great. Inspiring. Except he dies at the end! Of
exhaustion! “In real life,” George Orwell observed, “it is always the
anvil that breaks the hammer.”
Work will not set you free. It will kill you if you’re not careful.
Prince Albert’s children would have gladly traded a less exciting
Great Exhibition to have Albert for a little longer, and so too would
Queen Victoria and the British people.
The email you think you need so desperately to respond to can
wait. Your screenplay does not need to be hurried, and you can even
take a break between it and the next one. The only person truly
requiring you to spend the night at the office is yourself. It’s okay to
say no. It’s okay to opt out of that phone call or that last-minute trip.

Good decisions are not made by those who are running on empty.
What kind of interior life can you have, what kind of thinking can
you do, when you’re utterly and completely overworked? It’s a
vicious cycle: We end up having to work more to fix the errors we
made when we would have been better off resting, having
consciously said no instead of reflexively saying yes. We end up
pushing good people away (and losing relationships) because we’re
wound so tight and have so little patience.
The bull in Robert Earl Keen’s “Front Porch Song” whose “work is
never done”? Do you want to be the artist who loses their joy for the
process, who has strip-mined their soul in such a way that there is
nothing left to draw upon? Burn out or fade away—that was the
question in Kurt Cobain’s suicide note. How is that even a dilemma?
It’s human being, not human doing, for a reason.
Moderation. Being present. Knowing your limits.
This is the key. The body that each of us has was a gift. Don’t
work it to death. Don’t burn it out.
Protect the gift.

GO TO SLEEP

There is a time for many words and there is a time for
sleep.
—HOMER, THE ODYSSEY

A

merican Apparel was a billion-dollar company that failed for
many reasons. It borrowed too much money. It had a toxic
workplace culture. It was besieged by lawsuits. It opened too many
stores. This was all written about many times during the company’s
public disintegration in 2014.
But one cause of its failure—a major reason why more than ten
thousand people lost their jobs and a company with $700 million in
annual sales simply disappeared—was overlooked by most outside
observers.*
When Dov Charney founded American Apparel, he had the notion
that he would be a completely accessible boss. As the company grew
from a dorm room operation to a global retailer and one of the
largest garment manufacturers in the world, he stuck to that. In fact,
his ego swelled at the idea of being at the center of every part of the
business.
It was a true open-door policy. Not just open-door but phone and
email too. Any employee, at any level of the company, from sleeve
sewer to sales associate to photographer, could reach out whenever
they had a problem. For good measure, during one of the company’s
many public relations crises, Charney posted his phone number
online for any journalist or customer who had an issue as well.

Early on, this policy had advantages. Charney was constantly in
tune with what was happening in the company, and it prevented
bureaucracy from establishing itself and bogging people down. But
not only did the advantage not scale well, but the costs began to take
their toll as well.
You can imagine what happened when the company suddenly had
250 stores in 20 countries. By 2012, Charney was sleeping only a few
hours a night. By 2014, he wasn’t sleeping at all. How could he?
There was always someone with a problem and someone somewhere
in some distant time zone taking him up on the open-door policy.
The human reality of getting older didn’t help either.
It was this extreme, cumulative sleep deprivation that was the
root of so much of the company’s catastrophic failure. How could it
not be? Research has shown that as we approach twenty or so hours
without sleep, we are as cognitively impaired as a drunk person. Our
brains respond more slowly and our judgment is significantly
impaired.
In 2014, during a difficult transition between distribution
facilities, Charney moved into the shipping and fulfillment
warehouse, installing a shower and cot in a small office. To him and
some diehard loyalists, this was proof of his heroic dedication to the
company. In truth, bad judgment had bungled the transition in the
first place, and then his constant presence and micromanaging on
site—which became increasingly erratic the longer it went on and the
longer he went without sleep—only compounded the difficulties.
Charney descended into madness in front of his employees.
Unshaven. Bleary-eyed. At the mercy of his temper, unmoored from
even the most basic judgment or propriety. Issuing orders that
contradicted orders he had issued just minutes before, he seemed
almost hell-bent on destruction. But he was the boss. What could
people do?
Eventually, his mother was called in to bring him home, to coax
him into taking care of himself before it was too late. But he was well
past saving. Even back in the normal office, he would call employees
late, late into the night and sweetly talk about work until he drifted
off, finding that collapsing from exhaustion was the only way he
could put himself to bed.

Within a few months of the warehouse episode, Dov Charney was
on the verge of losing control of the company. Terms of desperate
rounds of financing had made him vulnerable to a takeover, but he
agreed to them without thinking through the implications. Sitting
before his handpicked board of directors, he mixed package after
package of pure Nescafé powder in cold water—essentially
mainlining caffeine to stay awake. By the time he left the meeting, he
no longer had a job.
Within a few months, his shares of the company were worthless.
Investors and debt collectors would find little left to salvage when
they sorted through the wreckage. He now owes a hedge fund twenty
million dollars and cannot even afford a lawyer.
It was an epic implosion along relatively common lines. The
overworked person creates a crisis that they try to solve by working
harder. Mistakes are piled upon mistakes by the exhausted, delirious
mind. The more they try, the worse it gets and the angrier they get
that no one appreciates their sacrifice.
People say, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” as they hasten that very
death, both literally and figuratively. They trade their health for a few
more working hours. They trade the long-term viability of their
business or their career before the urgency of some temporal crisis.
If we treat sleep as a luxury, it is the first to go when we get busy.
If sleep is what happens only when everything is done, work and
others will constantly be impinging on your personal space. You will
feel frazzled and put upon, like a machine that people don’t take care
of and assume will always function.
The philosopher and writer Arthur Schopenhauer used to say that
“sleep is the source of all health and energy.” He said it better still on
a separate occasion: “Sleep is the interest we have to pay on the
capital which is called in at death. The higher the interest rate and
the more regularly it is paid, the further the date of redemption is
postponed.”
Arianna Huffington woke up on the floor of her bathroom a few
years ago, covered in blood, her head searing with pain. She had
passed out from fatigue and broken her cheekbone. Her sister, who
was in the apartment at the time, recalls the sickening sound of
hearing the body hit the tile. It was a literal wake-up call for both of

them. This was no way to live. There was no glamour in working
oneself to the bone, trading sleep for an extra conference call or a few
minutes on television or a meeting with an important person.
That’s not success. It’s torture. And no human can endure it for
long. Indeed, your mind and soul are incapable of peace when your
body is battling for survival, when it is drawing on its reserves for
even basic functioning. Happiness? Stillness? Milking the solitude or
beauty out of your surroundings? Out of the question for the
exhausted, overworked fool.
The bloodshot engineer six Red Bulls deep has no chance of
stillness. Nor does the recent grad—or not-so-recent grad—who still
parties like she’s in college. Nor does the writer who plans poorly and
promises himself he’ll finish his book in a sleepless three-day sprint.
A 2017 study actually found that lack of sleep increases negative
repetitive thinking. Abusing the body leads the mind to abuse itself.
Sleep is the other side of the work we’re doing—sleep is the
recharging of the internal batteries whose energy stores we recruit in
order to do our work. It is a meditative practice. It is stillness. It’s the
time when we turn off. It’s built into our biology for a reason.
We have only so much energy for our work, for our relationships,
for ourselves. A smart person understands this and guards it
carefully. The greats—they protect their sleep because it’s where the
best state of mind comes from. They say no to things. They turn in
when they hit their limits. They don’t let the creep of sleep
deprivation undermine their judgment. They know there are some
people who can function without sleep, but they are also smart and
self-aware enough to know that everyone functions better when wellrested.
Anders Ericsson, of the classic ten-thousand-hours study, found
that master violinists slept eight and a half hours a night on average
and took a nap most days. (A friend said of Churchill, “He made in
Cuba one discovery which was to prove far more important to his
future life than any gain in military experience, the life-giving powers
of the siesta.”) According to Ericsson, great players nap more than
lesser ones.
How did the Zen master Hakuin prepare for his epic lecture, The
Records of Old Sokko? He slept. A lot. He slept so much and so

soundly that one of his students said that “his snores reverberated
through the house like rumblings of thunder.” It went on for more
than a month, with Hakuin waking only to see the occasional visitor.
But every other minute was spent facedown, passed out in blissful,
restful slumber.
His attendants, who had not yet learned to appreciate the power
of sleep, began to worry. The day the talks would be given was
rapidly approaching. Was the master ever going to get serious about
it? Or was he just going to waste his days asleep? They begged him to
start working while there was still time. He simply rolled over and
slept some more. Finally, as the deadline loomed large, but without a
hint of urgency, Hakuin got up. Sitting, he called to his attendants,
and began with perfect clarity to dictate the talk.
It was all there. It was brilliant.
It was the product of a rested mind that took care of its body. A
healthy soul that could sleep soundly. And it has echoed down
through the ages.
If you want peace, there is just one thing to do. If you want to be
your best, there is just one thing to do.
Go to sleep.

FIND A HOBBY

This is the main question, with what activity one’s
leisure is filled.
—ARISTOTLE

W

illiam Gladstone, the four-time prime minister of England, in
the generation before Winston Churchill, had an unusual
hobby. He loved going out into the woods near his home and
chopping down trees.
Huge trees. By hand.
In January 1876, he spent two full days working on an elm tree
with a girth of some sixteen feet. From Gladstone’s diary, we note
that on more than one thousand occasions he went to the forest with
his axe, often bringing his family along and making an outing of it. It
was said that he found the process so consuming, he had no time to
think of anything but where the next stroke of his axe would fall.
Many critics, one of whom happened to be Churchill’s father,
criticized Gladstone’s hobby as destructive. It really wasn’t.
Gladstone planted many trees in his life, pruned hundreds more, and
aggressively protected the health of the forests near his home,
believing that removing dead or decaying trees was a minor but
important service. In response to some critics who questioned why
he had taken down a particular oak, he explained that removing the
rotten members from the forest allowed more light and air to get to
the good trees—just as in politics (a joke for which he was promptly

cheered). His daughters also sold slivers of wood from the trees their
father had cut down as souvenirs to raise money for charity.
But above all, Gladstone’s arboreal activity was a way to rest a
mind that was often wearied by politics and the stresses of life.
During his final three terms as prime minister, from 1880 to the
early 1890s, Gladstone was out in the woods inspecting or chopping
more than three hundred times. Nor was an axe the only tool he used
to relax or be present. Gladstone was also said to enjoy vigorous
hikes, and mountain climbing well into old age, and the only thing
that appears in his diary more than tree felling is reading. (He
collected and read some twenty-five thousand books during his life.)
These activities were a relief from the pressures of politics, a
challenge for which effort was always rewarded and with which his
opponents could not interfere.
Without these release valves, who knows if he could have been as
good a leader? Without the lessons he learned in those woods—about
persistence, about patience, about doing your best, about the
importance of momentum and gravity—could he have fought the
long and good fight for the causes he believed in?
Nope.
When most of us hear the word “leisure,” we think of lounging
around and doing nothing. In fact, this is a perversion of a sacred
notion. In Greek, “leisure” is rendered as scholé—that is, school.
Leisure historically meant simply freedom from the work needed to
survive, freedom for intellectual or creative pursuits. It was learning
and study and the pursuit of higher things.
As society advanced and jobs became increasingly less physical,
but more exhausting mentally and spiritually, it became common for
leisure to include a diverse array of activities, from reading to
woodwork. Jesus, for instance, rested out on the water, fishing with
his disciples. Seneca wrote about how Socrates loved to play with
children, how Cato loved to relax with wine, how Scipio was
passionate about music. And we know this because Seneca’s own
leisure from politics was writing thoughtful, philosophical letters to
friends. John Cage picked up the hobby of mushroom hunting. He
observed that traipsing through the woods opened up the mind and
encouraged ideas to “fly into one’s head like birds.” Fred Rogers had
Á

his swimming. Saint Teresa of Ávila loved to dance, and so did Mae
Carol Jemison, the first African American woman in space. Simón
Bolívar too found dancing a helpful tool in balancing the affairs of
state and the burdens of revolution. The writer David Sedaris likes to
walk the back roads of his neighborhood in the English countryside
and pick up garbage, often for hours at a time. John Graves poured
himself into carving out his ranch from the Texas Hill Country, fixing
fences, raising cattle, and cultivating the land. Herbert Hoover loved
fishing so much, he wrote a book about it. The title: Fishing for Fun:
And to Wash Your Soul.
The swordsman Musashi, whose work was aggressively and
violently physical, took up painting late in life, and observed that
each form of art enriched the other. Indeed, flower arranging,
calligraphy, and poetry have long been popular with Japanese
generals and warriors, a wonderful pairing of opposites—strength
and gentleness, stillness and aggression. Hakuin, the Zen master,
excelled at painting and calligraphy, producing thousands of works
in his lifetime. NBA champion Chris Bosh taught himself how to
code. Einstein had his violin, Pythagoras has his lyre. William Osler,
the founder of Johns Hopkins University, told aspiring medical
students that when chemistry or anatomy distressed their soul, “seek
peace in the great pacifier, Shakespeare.”
Reading. Boxing. Collecting stamps. Whatever. Let it relax you
and give you peace.
In his essay on leisure, Josef Pieper wrote that “the ability to be
‘at leisure’ is one of the basic powers of the human soul.” But that’s
what’s so interesting about it. It’s a physical state—a physical action
—that somehow replenishes and strengthens the soul. Leisure is not
the absence of activity, it is activity. What is absent is any external
justification—you can’t do leisure for pay, you can’t do it to impress
people.
You have to do it for you.
But the good news is that leisure can be anything. It can be
cutting down trees, or learning another language. Camping or
restoring old cars. Writing poetry or knitting. Running marathons,
riding horses, or walking the beach with a metal detector. It can be,
as it was for Churchill, painting or bricklaying.

Pieper said that leisure was like saying a prayer before bed. It
might help you go to sleep—just as leisure might help you get better
at your job—but that can’t be the point.
Many people find relief in strenuous exercise. Sure, it might make
them stronger at work, but that’s not why they do it. It’s meditative
to put the body in motion and direct our mental efforts at conquering
our physical limitations. The repetition of a long swim, the challenge
of lifting heavy weights, the breathlessness of a sprint—there is a
cleansing experience, even if it is accompanied by suffering. It’s a
wonderful feeling there, right before the sweat breaks, when we can
feel ourselves working the stress up from the deep recesses of our
soul and our conscious mind and then out of the body.
“If an action tires your body but puts your heart at ease,” Xunzi
said, “do it.” There is a reason philosophers in the West often trained
in wrestling and boxing, while philosophers in the East trained in
martial arts. These are not easy activities, and if you’re not present
while you do them, you’ll get your ass kicked.
The point isn’t to simply fill the hours or distract the mind.
Rather, it’s to engage a pursuit that simultaneously challenges and
relaxes us. Students observed that in his leisure moments, Confucius
was “composed and yet fully at ease.” (He was also said to be very
skilled at “menial” tasks.) That’s the idea. It’s an opportunity to
practice and embody stillness but in another context.
It’s in this leisure, Ovid observed, that “we reveal what kind of
people we are.”
Assembling a puzzle, struggling with a guitar lesson, sitting on a
quiet morning in a hunting blind, steadying a rifle or a bow while we
wait for a deer, ladling soup in a homeless shelter. Our bodies are
busy, but our minds are open. Our hearts too.
Of course, leisure can easily become an escape, but the second
that happens it’s not leisure anymore. When we take something
relaxing and turn it into a compulsion, it’s not leisure, because we’re
no longer choosing it.
There is no stillness in that.
While we don’t want our leisure to become work, we do have to
work to make time for them. “For me,” Nixon wrote in his memoir,
“it is often harder to be away from the job than to be working at it.”

On the job, we are busy. We are needed. We have power. We are
validated. We have conflict and urgency and an endless stream of
distractions. Nixon said that the constant grind was “absolutely
necessary for superior performance.” But was his performance really
that superior? Or was that the whole problem?
At leisure, we are with ourselves. We are present. It’s us and the
fishing pole and the sound of the line going into the water. It’s us and
the waiting, giving up control. It’s us and the flash cards for the
language we are learning. It’s the humility of being bad at something
because we are a beginner, but having the confidence to trust in the
process.
No one is making us do this. We can quit if we’re struggling, we
can cut corners and cheat (ourselves) without fear of repercussion.
No money is on the line to motivate us, no rewards or validation but
the experience. To do leisure well—to be present, to be open, to be
virtuous, to be connected—is hard. We cannot let it turn into a job,
into another thing to dominate and to dominate others through.
We must be disciplined about our discipline and moderate in our
moderation.
Life is about balance, not about swinging from one pole to the
other. Too many people alternate between working and bingeing, on
television, on food, on video games, on lying around wondering why
they are bored. The chaos of life leads into the chaos of planning a
vacation.
Sitting alone with a canvas? A book club? A whole afternoon for
cycling? Chopping down trees? Who has the time?
If Churchill had the time, if Gladstone had the time, you have the
time.
Won’t my work suffer if I step away from it?
Seneca pointed out how readily we take risks with uncertain
payoffs in our career—but we’re afraid to risk even one minute of
time for leisure.
There’s nothing to feel guilty about for being idle. It’s not
reckless. It’s an investment. There is nourishment in pursuits that
have no purpose—that is their purpose.
Leisure is also a reward for the work we do. When we think about
the ideal “Renaissance man,” we see someone who is active and busy,

yes, but also fulfilled and balanced. Getting to know yourself is the
luxury of the success you’ve had. Finding fulfillment and joy in the
pursuit of higher things, you’ve earned it. It’s there for you, take it.
Make the time. Build the discipline.
You deserve it. You need it.
Your stillness depends on it.

BEWARE ESCAPISM

Me miserable! which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell.
—JOHN MILTON

A

fter the crushing disappointment of the unexpected failure of his
great novel Ask the Dust, John Fante needed an escape. He
would have loved to hit the road, to flee the town and the state that
had broken his heart, but he couldn’t. Fante was alternately too poor
and then too successful as a screenwriter to afford to leave
Hollywood. And soon after that, he was too married and had too
many kids to support.
Over the years he found many ways to numb the pain he felt. By
playing pinball for hours on end (his addiction was extreme enough
to be immortalized as a character in William Saroyan’s The Time of
Your Life). By drinking for hours on end in Hollywood bars, where
he kept company with F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner. By
spending so many hours on the course that he turned his everpatient wife, Joyce, into a golf widow.
It wasn’t restoration that Fante was chasing, nor was it leisure, it
was escape from real life.
In his own words, Fante pissed away decades golfing, reading,
and drinking, and by extension not writing novels. Because that felt
better than getting rejected again and again. Because it was easier

than sitting alone by himself in a room, doing battle with the demons
that made his writing so beautiful in the first place.
That’s the difference between leisure and escapism. It’s the
intention. Travel is wonderful, but is there not something sad to the
story in Johnny Cash’s life, as his first marriage fell apart and his
music became more formulaic and less fulfilling? Landing in L.A. at
the end of a long tour, instead of heading home to his family, he
walked up to the counter and asked to buy a ticket. To where?
“Wherever the next plane will take me,” he told the attendant.
Despair and restlessness go together.
The problem is that you can’t flee despair. You can’t escape, with
your body, problems that exist in your mind and soul. You can’t run
away from your choices—you can only fix them with better choices.
There’s nothing wrong with a good vacation (particularly if the
aim is solitude and quiet) or a round of golf, just as there is nothing
wrong with cracking a beer to take the edge off. Certainly Churchill
loved to travel and enjoyed champagne, though he stunk at golf.
But too often, the frenzied or the miserable think that an escape—
literal or chemical—is a positive good. Sure, the rush of traveling, the
thrill of surfing, or the altered state of a psychedelic can relieve some
of the tension that’s built up in our lives. Maybe you get some pretty
pictures out of it, and some pseudo-profundity that impresses your
friends.
But when that wears off? What’s left?
Nixon watched nearly five hundred movies during his time in the
White House. We know the darkness he was running from. There’s
no question that for Tiger Woods, his addictions were in part driven
by a desire to escape the pain left over from his childhood. But each
time he hopped on a private plane to Vegas instead of opening up to
his wife (or to his father while he was still alive), he was setting
himself up for more pain down the road. Each time John Fante hit
the golf course instead of the keys of his typewriter, or went out
drinking instead of being at home, he might have felt a temporary
escape, but it came at a very high cost.
When you defer and delay, interest is accumulating. The bill still
comes due . . . and it will be even harder to afford then than it will be
right now.

The one thing you can’t escape in your life is yourself.
Anyone who’s traveled long enough knows this. It’s eventually
clear we carry with us on the road more baggage than just our
suitcase and our backpacks.
Emerson, who in his own life traveled to England and Italy and
France and Malta and Switzerland (as well as extensively across
America), pointed out that the people who built the sights and
wonders that tourists liked to see didn’t do so while they traveled.
You can’t make something great flitting around. You have to stick
fast, like an axis of the earth. Those who think they will find
solutions to all their problems by traveling far from home, perhaps as
they stare at the Colosseum or some enormous moss-covered statue
of Buddha, Emerson said, are bringing ruins to ruins. Wherever they
go, whatever they do, their sad self comes along.
A plane ticket or a pill or some plant medicine is a treadmill, not a
shortcut. What you seek will come only if you sit and do the work, if
you probe yourself with real self-awareness and patience.
You have to be still enough to discover what’s really going on. You
have to let the muddy water settle. That can’t happen if you’re jetting
off from one place to another, if you’re packing your schedule with
every activity you can think of in order to avoid the possibility of
having to spend even a moment alone with your own thoughts.
In the fourth century BC, Mengzi spoke of how the Way is near,
but people seek it in what is distant. A few generations after that,
Marcus Aurelius pointed out that we don’t need to “get away from it
all.” We just need to look within. “Nowhere you can go is more
peaceful—more free of interruptions,” he said, “than your own soul.”
The next time we feel the urge to flee, to hit the road or bury
ourselves in work or activity, we need to catch ourselves. Don’t book
a cross-country flight—go for a walk instead. Don’t get high—get
some solitude, find some quiet. These are far easier, far more
accessible, and ultimately far more sustainable strategies for
accessing the stillness we were born with. Travel inside your heart
and your mind, and let the body stay put. “A quick visit should be
enough to ward off all,” Marcus wrote, “and send you back ready to
face what awaits you.”
Tuning out accomplishes nothing. Tune in.

If true peace and clarity are what you seek in this life—and by the
way, they are what you deserve—know that you will find them nearby
and not far away. Stick fast, as Emerson said. Turn into yourself.
Stand in place.
Stand in front of the mirror. Get to know your front porch.
You were given one body when you were born—don’t try to be
someone else, somewhere else. Get to know yourself.
Build a life that you don’t need to escape from.

ACT BRAVELY

To see people who will notice a need in the world and
do something about it. . . . Those are my heroes.
—FRED ROGERS

I

n Camus’s final novel, The Fall, his narrator, Clamence, is walking
alone on a street in Amsterdam when he hears what sounds like a
woman falling into the water. He’s not totally certain that’s what he
heard, but mostly, riding the high of a nice evening with his mistress,
he does not want to be bothered, and so he continues on.
A respected lawyer with a reputation as a person of great virtue in
his community, Clamence returns to his normal life the following day
and attempts to forget the sound he heard. He continues to represent
clients and entertain his friends with persuasive political arguments,
as he always has.
Yet he begins to feel off.
One day, after a triumphant appearance in court arguing for a
blind client, Clamence gets the feeling he is being mocked and
laughed at by a group of strangers he can’t quite locate. Later,
approaching a stalled motorist at an intersection, he is unexpectedly
insulted and then assaulted. These encounters are unrelated, but
they contribute to a weakening of the illusions he has long held about
himself.
It is not with an epiphany or from a blow to the head that the
monstrous truth of what he has done becomes clear. It is a slow,
creeping realization that comes to Clamence that suddenly and

irrevocably changes his self-perception: That night on the canal he
shrugged off a chance to save someone from committing suicide.
This realization is Clamence’s undoing and the central focus of
the book. Forced to see the hollowness of his pretensions and the
shame of his failings, he unravels. He had believed he was a good
man, but when the moment (indeed moments) called for goodness,
he slunk off into the night.
It’s a thought that haunts him incessantly. As he walks the streets
at night, the cry of that woman—the one he ignored so many years
ago—never ceases to torment him. It toys with him too, because his
only hope of redemption is that he might hear it again in real life and
then seize the opportunity to dive in and save someone from the
bottom of the canal.
It’s too late. He has failed. He will never be at peace again.
The story is fictional, of course, but a deeply incisive one, written
not coincidentally in the aftermath of the incredible moral failings of
Europe in the Second World War. Camus’s message to the reader
pierces us like the scream of the woman in Clamence’s memory:
High-minded thoughts and inner work are one thing, but all that
matters is what you do. The health of our spiritual ideals depends on
what we do with our bodies in moments of truth.
It is worth comparing the agony and torture of Clamence with a
more recent example from another French philosopher, Anne
Dufourmantelle, who died in 2017, aged fifty-three, rushing into the
surf to save two drowning children who were not her own. In her
writing, Anne had spoken often of risk—saying that it was impossible
to live life without risk and that in fact, life is risk. It is in the
presence of danger, she once said in an interview, that we are gifted
with the “strong incentive for action, dedication, and surpassing
oneself.”
And when, on the beach in Saint-Tropez, she was faced with a
moment of danger and risk, an opportunity to turn away or to do
good, she committed the full measure of devotion to her ideals.
What is better? To live as a coward or to die a hero? To fall
woefully short of what you know to be right or to fall in the line of
duty? And which is more natural? To refuse a call from your fellow
humans or to dive in bravely and help them when they need you?

Stillness is not an excuse to withdraw from the affairs of the
world. Quite the opposite—it’s a tool to let you do more good for
more people.
Neither the Buddhists nor the Stoics believed in what has come to
be called “original sin”—that we are a fallen and flawed and broken
species. On the contrary, they believe we were born good. To them,
the phrase “Be natural” was the same as “Do the right thing.” For
Aristotle, virtue wasn’t just something contained in the soul—it was
how we lived. It was what we did. He called it eudaimonia: human
flourishing.
A person who makes selfish choices or acts contrary to their
conscience will never be at peace. A person who sits back while
others suffer or struggle will never feel good, or feel that they are
enough, no matter how much they accomplish or how impressive
their reputation may be.
A person who does good regularly will feel good. A person who
contributes to their community will feel like they are a part of one. A
person who puts their body to good use—volunteering, protecting,
serving, standing up for—will not need to treat it like an amusement
park to get some thrills.
Virtue is not an abstract notion. We are not clearing our minds
and separating the essential from the inessential for the purposes of
a parlor trick. Nor are we improving ourselves so that we can get
richer or more powerful.
We are doing it to live better and be better.
Every person we meet and every situation we find ourselves in is
an opportunity to prove that.
It’s the old Boy Scout motto: “Do a Good Turn Daily.”
Some good turns are big, like saving a life or protecting the
environment. But good turns can also be small, Scouts are taught,
like a thoughtful gesture, mowing a neighbor’s lawn, calling 911 when
you see something amiss, holding open a door, making friends with a
new kid at school. It’s the brave who do these things. It’s the people
who do these things who make the world worth living in.
Marcus Aurelius spoke of moving from one unselfish action to
another—“only there,” he said, can we find “delight and stillness.” In
the Bible, Matthew 5:6 says that those who do right will be made full

by God. Too many believers seem to think that belief is enough. How
many people who claim to be of this religion or that one, if caught
and investigated, would be found guilty of living the tenets of love
and charity and selflessness?
Action is what matters.
Pick up the phone and make the call to tell someone what they
mean to you. Share your wealth. Run for office. Pick up the trash you
see on the ground. Step in when someone is being bullied. Step in
even if you’re scared, even if you might get hurt. Tell the truth.
Maintain your vows, keep your word. Stretch out a hand to someone
who has fallen.
Do the hard good deeds. “You must do the thing you cannot do,”
Eleanor Roosevelt said.
It will be scary. It won’t always be easy, but know that what is on
the other side of goodness is true stillness.
Think of Dorothy Day, and indeed, many other less famous
Catholic nuns, who worked themselves to the bone helping other
people. While they may have lacked for physical possessions and
wealth, they found great comfort in seeing the shelters they had
provided, and the self-respect they’d restored for people whom
society had cast aside. Let us compare that to the anxiety of the
helicopter parents who think of nothing but which preschool to
enroll their toddler in, or the embezzling business partner who is just
one audit away from getting caught. Compare that to the nagging
insecurity we feel knowing that we are not living the way we should
or that we are not doing enough for other people.
If you see fraud, and do not say fraud, the philosopher Nassim
Taleb has said, you are a fraud. Worse, you will feel like a fraud. And
you will never feel proud or happy or confident.
Will we fall short of our own standards? Yes. When this happens,
we don’t need to whip ourselves, as Clamence did, we must simply let
it instruct and teach us, as all injuries do.
That’s why twelve-step groups ask their members to be of service
as part of their recovery. Not because good deeds can undo the past,
but because they help get us out of our heads, and in the process,
help us write the script for a better future.
If we want to be good and feel good, we have to do good.

There is no escaping this.
Dive in when you hear the cry for help. Reach out when you see
the need. Do kindness where you can.
Because you’ll have to find a way to live with yourself if you don’t.

ON TO THE FINAL ACT

As a well-spent day brings a happy sleep, so a wellemployed life brings a happy death.
—LEONARDO DA VINCI

I

t was AD 161 and the emperor Antoninus Pius knew he was going
to die. He was seventy-four years old and he could feel the life
leaving his body. A fever had taken hold and his stomach pained him.
With his last bit of strength, he called his adopted son Marcus
Aurelius into the room and began the process of transferring the
state over to him. When this task was complete, Antoninus turned to
his royal audience and spoke his final word—a word that would echo
down through not just the life of his son but all of history, down even
to us today: aequanimitas.
A few hundred years before, in roughly 400 BC, Buddha accepted
with equal equanimity that he too would soon pass from this earth.
He was a little older than Antoninus, but he had not certified a
successor, for although he was born a prince, he’d renounced his
patrimony in the pursuit of enlightenment. Still, he could tell that his
students were worried about losing him, about how they would
continue their journey without his guidance and love.
“You may be thinking,” he said to them, “‘The word of the
Teacher is now a thing of the past; now we have no more teacher.’
But that is not how you should see it. Let the Dhamma and the
Discipline that I have taught you be your Teacher when I am gone.”

Then, just as Antoninus had done, he prepared for his final
words. His last chance for passing on wisdom to the people he loved,
to the people he knew would face all the difficulties that life throws at
us. “All individual things pass away,” he said. “Seek your liberation
with diligence.”
Then Buddha fell into a deep sleep and never woke again.
It is fitting that between the deaths of these two titans came
Epicurus, the philosopher whose unique way of living almost
perfectly bridges the Eastern and Western schools. In 270 BC, he
also had the self-awareness to know he did not have much more
time. “On this happy day, which is the last day of my life,” Epicurus
began his final letter, “I write the following words to you.” Despite
the considerable pain he felt, his body racked by blockages in the
bladder and bowels, he wrote instead of the joy in his heart, and the
fond recollections he had of conversations with his friends. Then he
got to the purpose of the letter—a set of instructions for the care of a
promising pupil he wanted to make sure was looked after. Within a
few hours and without much fanfare, Epicurus would join Buddha
and Antoninus in eternity, in death.
Three approaches. Different, but in the end the same.
Clear.
Calm.
Kind.
Still.
Each of the domains we have studied addressed in their own way.
The mind.
The soul.
The body.
The mental. The spiritual. The physical.
Three legs in a stool. Three points along a perfect circle.
None of us are long for this world. Death hangs over us all,
whether we notice or not, whether we believe it or not.
Tomorrow, we could discover we have cancer. Two weeks from
now, a heavy branch could fall from a tree and take us with it. The
prognosis is terminal for each and every person and has been from
the moment we were born. Our heart beats without fail for an
uncertain amount of time, and then one day, suddenly, it is still.

Memento mori.
This is a fact that, perhaps more than anything else, is responsible
for incredible amounts of anxiety and distress. It’s scary to think that
we will die. As is the fact that we cannot know for certain what will
happen when death comes, whenever that is. Is there such a thing as
heaven? Or hell? Is death painful? Is it nothingness, a dark backward
abysm of time?
Seneca reminded himself that before we were born we were still
and at peace, and so we will be once again after we die. A light loses
nothing by being extinguished, he said, it just goes back to how it was
before.
The denial of this simple, humbling reality—the denial of death—
is why we attempt to build monuments to our own greatness, it’s why
we worry and argue so much, why we chase pleasure and money and
cannot be still while we are alive. It’s ironic that we spend so much of
our precious time on earth either impotently fighting death or futilely
attempting to ignore the thought of it.
It was Cicero who said that to study philosophy is to learn how to
die.
Most of this book has been about how to live well. But in so doing,
it is also about how to die well. Because they are the same thing.
Death is where the three domains we have studied in these pages
come together.
We must learn to think rationally and clearly about our own fate.
We must find spiritual meaning and goodness while we are alive.
We must treat the vessel we inhabit on this planet well—or we
will be forced to abandon it early.
Death brings an end to everything, to our minds, our souls, and
our bodies, in a final, permanent stillness.
So we end this book there as well.

AFTERWORD

I

t’s getting to be early evening now, and about time for me to get up
from the computer, having made some progress on the pages you
just read. Years ago I got myself out of the busy city and set up my
family here, on a little spread outside town, with a picture of Oliver
Sacks and his “No!” sign hanging above my desk. Now that my
writing day is done, I’ve got work to do on the farm—chickens to
feed, some donkeys to sneak carrots to, and fences to inspect. Not
unlike the plot of that Zen poem about the taming of the bull, my
neighbor’s longhorn has gotten onto my property, and I need to go
find him.
My young son helps me load some tools into the back of the ATV
—“the tractor, the twahktor!” he calls it—and then I hug him and
head down the levee, through to the middle pasture, and back down
by the creek. The fence there has started to weaken, from the
elements and the explorations of the wayward bull, and I spend the
next hour grabbing and pinching T-post clips. You take the clip and
wrap it around the back of the post, grab the end with the pliers,
hooking it over the wire and twisting it tight so it can’t come loose.
Wrap, grab, hook, twist. Wrap, grab, hook, twist.
No thinking, just doing.
The sweat gets going quickly in Texas, and my leather gloves are
shades darker almost as soon as I start. But by the end the fence is
tight. I tell myself it will hold—or so I hope. Next up is moving the
hay, backing the buggy up to the round bale, letting the arm fall over
top of it, and then gunning the engine of the ATV. It catches, teeters,
flips up, and falls over, two thousand pounds of food now lying flat
on the trailer. By the time I’ve driven to where I need to drop it, the

cows have gotten wise to the sound and come running to investigate.
I line it up with the hay ring, back up again, and watch it come
tumbling off the back. With the knife in my pocket, I cut off the
netting and drop the heavy steel hay ring over it to prevent waste.
The cows begin to eat, yelling in appreciation, jostling with each
other for their place at the bale.
With them properly distracted, it’s time for me to go find this
bull. I heard him when I was working and suspect he’s over in the
back corner of the front pasture. I find him there, a ton or more of
muscle and horns. I’m a little frustrated. This is not my problem,
though my neighbor seems not to mind that this keeps happening. I
behold him there, as the poem says, but keep my distance. Not just
because I don’t want to be gored, but because in rushing this process
before, in getting him worked up, I’ve run the bull right through a
barbed-wire fence—a costly reminder of the risks of impatience.
The key is to nudge him in the direction you want to go, to
eliminate the other options and then get him moving. It’s got to feel
like it’s his idea. Otherwise, he’ll panic and get angry. And the
problem goes from bad to worse.
So I just stand there, resting against some cedar, looking up at the
first croppings of the Violet Crown—the Texas sunset that settles
over Austin—that is coming toward the horizon. In this moment, I
am at peace. It doesn’t matter how tough things have been lately. It
doesn’t matter what’s going on in the world. My breathing is slowing
down. There is no social media here. The outrage factory that has
become the news cycle can’t reach me. Neither can my clients or
business partners—there’s no reception in these woods. I am far from
this manuscript I have been working on. Far from my research and
my notes, from my comfortable office and the craft that I love. And
here, far from my work, the story of Shawn Green, which I read
months ago, and what he was really teaching us slips from my
subconscious into the front of my mind. I get it now. I get what he
was after.
Chop wood, carry water. Fix fences, load hay, seize the bull.
My mind is empty. My heart is full. My body is busy.
Attamen tranquillus.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

One of the simplest and most accessible entry points into stillness is
gratitude. Gratitude for being alive, for the lucky breaks you’ve
gotten, and for all the people in your life who have helped you. Each
morning, I try to take some time to think about these very things, but
for the most part, such thanks remain private. With this little space
allowed to me here, I’d like to thank everyone who helped make this
book possible—my wife, Samantha, first and foremost. I am grateful
for her guidance and support and natural stillness, which I learn
from constantly. My son, Clark, who went on many long walks with
me as I worked out the words in this book. My sister, Amy, whose
poise and strength as she battles cancer has deeply moved and
humbled me. I am grateful to my agent and collaborator, Steve
Hanselman, who helped not only with translations but with the
shaping of the idea. Nils Parker, who has been a sounding board for
my writing ideas for over a decade now, and Brent Underwood for all
his help marketing and building my platform. Thank you to Hristo
Vassilev for all his important research and fact-checking help. Niki
Papadopoulos, my editor, and the rest of the Portfolio team at
Penguin Random House—thank you for all the work on all my books.
To the logos that brought all these people and factors together . . .
I should also thank my donkeys and cows and goats (for their
lessons on being, not doing), but there are too many to name. I’m
also grateful for the chance to workshop many of the ideas in this
book on Thought Catalog, Observer, Medium, and DailyStoic.com
My final and most serious gratitude goes out to the thinkers and
philosophers whose ideas make up this book. It would not have been
possible without them, but more important, their insights and

writings have made my life better. I’m grateful too to the heroes (and
villains) in the stories written here, as their all-too-human successes
and failures both inspire and caution anyone in search of happiness,
excellence, and stillness. My own search is nowhere near complete,
but their example has helped me make a few inches on a journey that
—God(s) willing—is only just beginning.

CHAPTER 1
THE UNSTRAIGHTFORWARD PATH

Midway upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
—DANTE, THE DIVINE COMEDY: INFERNO, CANTO I

IN EVERY CULTURE WE KNOW OF, WHETHER IT BE SECULAR or religious, ethnically
diverse or not, the question of how to live is central. How should we handle
life’s challenges and vicissitudes? How should we conduct ourselves in the
world and treat others? And the ultimate question: how do we best prepare for
the final test of our character, the moment when we die?
The numerous religions and philosophies that have been devised over human
history to address these issues offer answers ranging from the mystical to the
hyper-rational. Recently, even science has gotten into the business, with an
onslaught of technical papers and popular books on happiness and how to
achieve it, accompanied by the obligatory brain scans displaying “your brain
on…” whatever it is that may increase or decrease your satisfaction with life.
Correspondingly, the tools to seek answers to existential questions vary as much
as the approaches that have been used—from sacred texts to deep meditation,
from philosophical arguments to scientific experiments.
The resulting panorama is truly astounding and reflects both the creativity of
the human spirit and the urgency that we obviously attach to inquiries into
meaning and purpose. You can embrace any of a large variety of options within
the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religions, for instance; or choose one of a panoply of
schools of Buddhism; or opt instead for Taoism, or Confucianism, among many
others. If philosophy, rather than religion, is your cup of tea, then you can turn to
existentialism, secular humanism, secular Buddhism, ethical culture, and so
forth. Or you can arrive instead at the conclusion that there is no meaning—

indeed, the very search for it is meaningless—and embrace a “happy” sort of
nihilism (yes, there is such a thing).
For my part, I’ve become a Stoic. I do not mean that I have started keeping a
stiff upper lip and suppressing my emotions. As much as I love the character of
Mr. Spock (which Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry purportedly modeled
after his—naïve, as it turns out—understanding of Stoicism), these traits
represent two of the most common misconceptions about what it means to be a
Stoic. In reality, Stoicism is not about suppressing or hiding emotion—rather, it
is about acknowledging our emotions, reflecting on what causes them, and
redirecting them for our own good. It is also about keeping in mind what is and
what is not under our control, focusing our efforts on the former and not wasting
them on the latter. It is about practicing virtue and excellence and navigating the
world to the best of our abilities, while being mindful of the moral dimension of
all our actions. As I explain in this book, in practice Stoicism involves a dynamic
combination of reflecting on theoretical precepts, reading inspirational texts, and
engaging in meditation, mindfulness, and other spiritual exercises.
One of the key tenets of Stoicism is that we ought to recognize, and take
seriously, the difference between what we can and cannot master. This
distinction—also made by some Buddhist doctrines—is often taken to indicate a
tendency of Stoics to withdraw from social engagement and public life, but a
closer look at both Stoic writings and, more importantly, the lives of famous
Stoics will dispel this impression: Stoicism was very much a philosophy of
social engagement and encouraged love for all humankind and Nature as well. It
is this apparently contradictory tension between the advice to focus on one’s
thoughts and the social dimension of Stoicism that drew me to it as a practice.
I arrived at Stoicism, not on my way to Damascus, but through a combination
of cultural happenstance, life’s vicissitudes, and deliberate philosophical choice.
In retrospect, it seems inevitable that my path would eventually lead me to the
Stoics. Raised in Rome, I have considered Stoicism part of my cultural heritage
ever since I studied ancient Greek and Roman history and philosophy in high
school, although it wasn’t until recently that I sought to make its principles part
of my everyday life.
I am by profession a scientist and philosopher, and I have therefore always
been inclined to seek more coherent ways to understand the world (through
science) and better choices for living my life (through philosophy). A few years
ago, I wrote a book, Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can
Lead Us to a More Meaningful Life, in which I explored such a framework,

which I called sciphi. The basic approach was to combine the ancient idea of
virtue ethics, which focuses on character development and the pursuit of
personal excellence as the pillars providing meaning to our lives, with the latest
that the natural and social sciences tell us about human nature and how we work,
fail, and learn. As it happened, this was only the beginning of my journey toward
philosophical self-awareness.
Something else was going on at the time that made me pause and reflect. I
have not been a religious person since my teenage years (I was prompted to
leave Catholicism, in part, by reading Bertrand Russell’s famous Why I Am Not a
Christian in high school), and as such I have been on my own in dealing with
questions of where my morals and the meaning in my life come from. I take it
that an increasing number of people in the United States and across the world
find themselves facing a similar conundrum. While sympathetic to the idea that
lack of religious affiliation should be just as acceptable a choice in life as any
religious one, and strongly supportive of the constitutional separation of church
and state in the United States and elsewhere, I have also grown increasingly
dissatisfied with (make that downright irritated by) the intolerant anger of the socalled New Atheists, represented by Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, among
others. Although public criticism of religion (or of any idea) is the staple of a
healthy democratic society, people don’t respond very well to being belittled and
insulted. On this point the Stoic philosopher Epictetus clearly agrees with me, all
the while displaying his characteristic sense of humor: “At this point you run the
risk of him saying, ‘What business is that of yours, sir? What are you to me?’
Pester him further, and he is liable to punch you in the nose. I myself was once
keen for this sort of discourse, until I met with just such a reception.”
There are, of course, alternatives to the New Atheism if you want to pursue a
nonreligious approach to life, including secular Buddhism and secular
humanism. Yet these two paths—the two major ones on offer for those seeking a
meaningful secular existence—are somehow unsatisfactory to me, though for
opposite reasons. I find Buddhism’s currently dominant modes a bit too
mystical, and its texts opaque and hard to interpret, especially in light of what we
know about the world and the human condition from modern science (and
despite a number of neurobiological studies that persuasively show the mental
benefits of meditation). Secular humanism, which I have embraced for years,
suffers from the opposite problem: it is too dependent on science and a modern
conception of rationality, with the result that—despite the best efforts of its
supporters—it comes across as cold and not the sort of thing you want to bring

your kids to on a Sunday morning. Hence, I think, the spectacular lack of
success (numerically speaking) of secular humanist organizations.
By contrast, in Stoicism I have found a rational, science-friendly philosophy
that includes a metaphysics with a spiritual dimension, is explicitly open to
revision, and, most importantly, is eminently practical. The Stoics accepted the
scientific principle of universal causality: everything has a cause, and everything
in the universe unfolds according to natural processes. There is no room for
spooky transcendental stuff. But they also believed that the universe is structured
according to what they called the Logos, which can be interpreted as either God
or simply what is sometimes termed “Einstein’s god”: the simple, indubitable
fact that Nature is understandable by reason.
Although other components of the Stoic system are important, by far the
distinguishing feature of Stoicism is its practicality: it began in the guise of, and
has always been understood as, a quest for a happy and meaningful life. Not
surprisingly, then, its fundamental texts—pretty much all of them coming to us
from the late Roman Stoa (as the Stoic school was called), since most of the
early writings have been lost—are paragons of clarity. Epictetus, Seneca,
Musonius Rufus, and Marcus Aurelius speak to us in plain language, far
removed from the often cryptic Buddhist texts or even the flowery allegories of
early Christianity. One of my favorite quotations, again from Epictetus,
exemplifies this down-to-earth practicality: “Death is necessary and cannot be
avoided. I mean, where am I going to go to get away from it?”
The final reason I turned to Stoicism is that this philosophy speaks most
directly and convincingly to the inevitability of death and how to prepare for it. I
recently passed the half-century mark, a seemingly arbitrary point in life that
nonetheless prompted me to engage in broader reflections: who am I, and what
am I doing? As a nonreligious person, I was also looking for some sort of
playbook on how to prepare for the eventual end of my life. Beyond my own
preoccupations, we live in a society where life keeps being extended by modern
science and more and more of us will consequently find ourselves needing to
decide what to do with our existence for decades after retiring. Moreover,
whatever we decide about the meaning of our extended lives, we also need to
find ways of preparing ourselves and our loved ones to face the permanent
demise of our own consciousness, of our unique presence in this world. And we
need to know how to die in a dignified way that allows us to achieve tranquillity
of mind and is of comfort to those who survive us.
Famously, the original Stoics devoted a great deal of effort and many writings

to what Seneca referred to as the ultimate test of character and principle. “We die
every day,” he wrote to his friend Gaius Lucillius. Seneca connected this test to
the rest of our existence on earth: “A man cannot live well if he knows not how
to die well.” Life, for the Stoics, is an ongoing project, and death, its logical,
natural end point, is nothing special in and of itself and nothing that we should
particularly fear. This view resonated with me, striking a balance as it did
between opposite attitudes to which I had been exposed and which I found
unpalatable: no fantasizing about an immortality of which there is neither
evidence nor reason to believe in, but also no secular dismissal—or worse,
avoidance—of the issue of death and personal extinction.
For these and other reasons, I’m not alone in my quest to revive this ancient
practical philosophy and adapt it to twenty-first-century life. Every fall
thousands of people participate in Stoic Week, a worldwide philosophy event–
cum–social science experiment organized by a team at the University of Exeter
in England, with the collaboration of academic philosophers, cognitive
therapists, and everyday practitioners from all over the world. The goal of Stoic
Week is twofold: on the one hand, to get people to learn about Stoicism and its
relevance to their lives, and on the other hand, to collect systematic data to see
whether practicing Stoicism actually makes a difference. The preliminary results
from the Exeter initiative are tentative (in future Stoic Weeks, more sophisticated
experimental protocols will be used and larger sample sizes collected), but they
are promising. Participants in the third international Stoic Week, for instance,
reported a 9 percent increase in positive emotions, an 11 percent decrease in
negative emotions, and a 14 percent improvement in life satisfaction after one
week of practice. (The previous year the team conducted longer-term follow-ups,
and they confirmed the initial results for people who kept practicing.)
Participants also seem to think that Stoicism makes them more virtuous: 56
percent gave Stoic practice a high mark in that regard. Of course, this is a selfselected sample of people who have an interest in Stoicism and buy into at least
some of its assumptions and practices. Then again, for people who are already
somewhat committed to this particular approach to see such significant changes
in the span of a few days ought to at least encourage interested others to pay
attention.
Results like these are not entirely surprising, given that Stoicism is the
philosophical root of a number of evidence-based psychological therapies,
including Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy and Albert Ellis’s rational emotive
behavior therapy. Of Ellis it has been said that “no individual—not even Freud

himself—has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.” Frankl was a
neurologist and psychiatrist who survived the Holocaust and wrote the bestselling book Man’s Search for Meaning. His moving and inspiring story of
resilience can be read as a contemporary example of Stoicism in practice. Both
Ellis and Frankl acknowledged Stoicism as an important influence in developing
their therapeutic approaches, with Frankl characterizing logotherapy as a type of
existential analysis. Another compelling account of Stoicism is provided by Vice
Admiral James Stockdale in his memoir In Love and War. Stockdale famously
credited Stoicism (and in particular his readings of Epictetus) for his survival
under prolonged horrid conditions in a Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp. Also
owing a significant debt to Stoicism is the increasingly diverse family of
practices that goes under the general rubric of cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT), which was initially deployed to treat depression and now is more widely
applied to a variety of mental conditions. Aaron T. Beck, author of Cognitive
Therapy of Depression, acknowledges this debt when he writes, “The
philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic
philosophers.”
Of course, Stoicism is a philosophy, not a type of therapy. The difference is
crucial: a therapy is intended to be a short-term approach to helping people
overcome specific problems of a psychological nature; it doesn’t necessarily
provide a general picture, or philosophy, of life. A philosophy of life is
something we all need, however, and something we all develop, consciously or
not. Some people simply import wholesale whatever framework for life they
acquire from a religion. Others make up their own philosophy as they go along,
without thinking too much about it, but nonetheless engaging in actions and
decisions that reflect some implicit understanding of what life is about. Still
others would rather—as Socrates famously put it—take the time to examine their
life in order to live it better.
Stoicism, like any life philosophy, may not appeal to or work for everyone. It
is rather demanding, stipulating that moral character is the only truly worthy
thing to cultivate; health, education, and even wealth are considered “preferred
indifferents” (although Stoics don’t advocate asceticism, and many of them
historically enjoyed the good things in life). Such “externals” do not define who
we are as individuals and have nothing to do with our personal worth, which
depends on our character and our exercise of the virtues. In this sense, Stoicism
is eminently democratic, cutting across social classes: whether you are rich or
poor, healthy or sick, educated or ignorant, it makes no difference to your ability

to live a moral life and thus achieve what the Stoics called ataraxia, or
tranquillity of mind.
For all its uniqueness, Stoicism has numerous points of contact with other
philosophies, with religions (Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, and Christianity), and
with modern movements such as secular humanism and ethical culture. There is
something very appealing to me, as a nonreligious person, in the idea of such an
ecumenical philosophy, one that can share goals and at least some general
attitudes with other major ethical traditions across the world. This commonality
has allowed me to reject more forcefully the strident New Atheism that I
criticized earlier, and it also allows religious persons to distance themselves from
the even more pernicious fundamentalisms of different stripes that have been
plaguing our recent history. To a Stoic, it ultimately does not matter if we think
the Logos is God or Nature, as long as we recognize that a decent human life is
about the cultivation of one’s character and concern for other people (and even
for Nature itself) and is best enjoyed by way of a proper—but not fanatical—
detachment from mere worldly goods.
There are also, naturally, challenges that remain unresolved, and which I will
explore along with the reader in How to Be a Stoic. The original Stoicism, for
instance, was a comprehensive philosophy that included not only ethics but also
a metaphysics, a natural science, and specific approaches to logic and
epistemology (that is, a theory of knowledge). The Stoics considered these other
aspects of their philosophy important because they fed into and informed their
main concern: how to live one’s life. The idea was that in order to decide on the
best approach to living we also need to understand the nature of the world
(metaphysics), how it works (natural science), and how (imperfectly) we come
to understand it (epistemology).
But many of the particular notions developed by the ancient Stoics have
ceded place to new ones introduced by modern science and philosophy and need
therefore to be updated. For instance, as William Irvine explains in his lucid A
Guide to the Good Life, the clear dichotomy the Stoics drew between what is and
is not under our control is too strict: beyond our own thoughts and attitudes,
there are some things that we can and, depending on circumstances, must
influence—up to the point where we recognize that nothing more is in our power
to be done. It is also true, conversely, that the Stoics turned out to be overly
optimistic about how much control human beings have over their own thoughts.
Modern cognitive science has shown over and over again that we are often prey
to cognitive biases and delusions. But in my view, this knowledge reinforces the

idea that we need to train ourselves in virtuous and right thinking, as the Stoics
advised.
Finally, one of the most attractive features of Stoicism is that the Stoics were
open to considering challenges to their doctrines and altering them accordingly.
In other words, it is an open-ended philosophy, ready to incorporate criticism
from other schools (for instance, the so-called Skeptics of ancient times) as well
as new discoveries. As Seneca famously put it: “Men who have made these
discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides. Truth lies open for all;
it has not yet been monopolized. And there is plenty of it left even for posterity
to discover.” In a world of fundamentalism and hardheaded doctrines, it is
refreshing to embrace a worldview that is inherently open to revision.
For all these reasons, I have decided to commit to Stoicism as a philosophy
of life, to explore it, to study it, to find areas of improvement if possible, and to
share it with like-minded others. In the end, of course, Stoicism is yet another
(unstraightforward) path devised by humanity to develop a more coherent view
of the world, of who we are, and of how we fit into the broader scheme of things.
The need for this sort of insight seems to be universal, and in How to Be a Stoic I
will do my best to guide the reader down this ancient and yet remarkably modern
road.
The problem is that I myself am rather a novice when it comes to Stoic
philosophy, so we actually need to turn to a more expert chaperone, someone
who can gently show us the way, nudging us away from the most common
mistakes and keeping us on the path toward enlightenment. When Dante
Alighieri went on his own spiritual journey—which resulted in the writing of the
beautiful Divine Comedy—he imagined himself suddenly lost in the middle of a
dark forest, with his way forward uncertain. It turned out that he was at the
(imaginary) entrance to Hell, about to descend into its depths. Lucky for him, he
had a sure mentor to guide him on his journey, the Roman poet Virgil. The
journey we are about to embark upon is not as momentous as a visit to Hell, and
this book certainly is no Divine Comedy, but in a sense we are lost too, and in
need of guidance just as surely as Dante was. My choice for the role of our guide
is Epictetus, the very first Stoic I encountered when I began my own exploration
of that philosophy.
Epictetus was born in Hierapolis (present-day Pamukkale in Turkey) around
the year 55 CE. Epictetus was not his real name, which is lost to us: the word
simply means “acquired,” reflecting the fact that he was a slave. His known
master was Epaphroditos, a wealthy freedman (that is, a former slave himself)

who worked as a secretary to the emperor Nero in Rome, which is where
Epictetus spent his youth. He was crippled, either by birth or because of an
injury received while he was a slave under a former master. At any rate,
Epaphroditos treated Epictetus well and allowed him to study Stoic philosophy
under one of the most renowned teachers in Rome, Musonius Rufus.
After Nero’s death in 68 CE, Epictetus was freed by his master—a common
practice in Rome with particularly intelligent and educated slaves. He then set up
his own school in the capital of the empire, and taught there until 93 CE, when
the emperor Domitian banned all philosophers from the city. (Philosophers in
general, and Stoics in particular, were persecuted by a number of emperors,
especially Vespasian and Domitian. Scores of philosophers were either killed—
including Seneca right before the end of Nero’s reign—or exiled, as happened
twice to Musonius. The Stoic penchant for speaking truth to power, as we would
say today, did not go over well with some of the people who held very dearly to
that power.)
Epictetus then moved his school to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece, where
he may have been visited by the emperor Hadrian (one of the five so-called good
emperors, the last of whom was Marcus Aurelius, arguably the most famous
Stoic of all time). Epictetus became renowned as a teacher and attracted a
number of high-profile students, including Arrian of Nicomedia, who transcribed
some of the master’s lectures. Those lectures are known today as the Discourses,
and I will use them as the basis for our exploration of Stoicism in this book.
Epictetus never married, though late in his life he began to live with a woman
who helped him raise the child of a friend, a boy who would have otherwise
been left to die. Epictetus himself died around 135 CE.
What a remarkable figure, no? A crippled slave who acquires an education,
becomes a free man, establishes his own school, is exiled by one emperor but is
on friendly terms with another, and selflessly helps a young child near the end of
a simple life that will continue until the very ripe age, especially for the time, of
eighty. Oh, and most importantly, who utters some of the most powerful words
ever spoken by any teacher in the entire Western world and beyond. Epictetus is
the perfect guide for our journey, not simply because he was the first Stoic I
happened to encounter, but because of his sensitivity and intelligence, his dark
sense of humor, and his disagreement with me on a number of important points,
which will allow me to demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of Stoic
philosophy and its capacity to adapt to times and places as different from each
other as second-century Rome and twenty-first-century New York.

So let us explore Stoicism together in a running conversation with Epictetus
via his discourses. We will talk about subjects as varied as God,
cosmopolitanism in an increasingly fractured world, taking care of our families,
the relevance of our own character, managing anger and disability, the morality
(or not) of suicide, and a lot more. Other Stoic authors, both ancient and modern,
will occasionally supplement what we learn from Epictetus, and sometimes I
will gently push back against some of our guide’s notions, bringing up advances
in philosophy and science over the intervening centuries and debating what a
modern take on Stoicism might look like. The goal is to learn something about
how to answer that most fundamental question: How ought we to live our lives?

CHAPTER 2

A ROAD MAP FOR THE JOURNEY

What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows smoothly?
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, I.4

WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND IN SOMEPLACE NEW, I LIKE TO bring along a map of the
territory. It gives me a sense of where I’m going, where I shouldn’t go, and a
context for all the things I will be experiencing during the journey. This chapter
is a map of the broad contours of Stoicism, as well as a summary of the guiding
principles that structure the rest of the book, so that you may make the most out
of this experience. I am convinced that we can hardly appreciate a philosophy or
a religion (or any complex idea, really) without some understanding of its often
nonlinear path of development, and so let’s begin with a closer look at the
history of the philosophy that we are about to explore, and which you might
decide to apply to your life.
As the story is told by Diogenes Laertius in his Lives of the Eminent
Philosophers, Stoicism began in Athens, Greece, around the year 300 BCE. Zeno,
a Phoenician merchant and native of Citium (modern-day Cyprus) who, we are
assured, was fond of eating green figs and basking in the sun, became interested
in philosophy after being shipwrecked on a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus
with a cargo of purple. He went up into Athens and sat down in a bookseller’s
shop, being then a man of thirty. As he went on reading the second book of
Xenophon’s Memorabilia, he was so pleased that he inquired where men like
Socrates were to be found. Crates [a Cynic philosopher] passed by in the nick of
time, so the bookseller pointed to him and said, “Follow yonder man.”
Zeno did follow Crates and became his student. One of the first things he
learned from his new teacher was to practice not being ashamed of things of
which there is nothing to be ashamed. Crates had Zeno go around with a potful
of lentil soup. Crates then broke the pot, and Zeno took to flight in shame, with

his teacher yelling after him, in full view of a crowd: “Why run away, my little
Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen you.” Zeno studied under Crates and
other philosophers for several years, after which he felt confident enough to start
his own school. While initially his followers were, predictably enough, called
Zenonians, eventually they began to be referred to as “Stoics,” because they met
under the Stoa Poikile, or painted porch, a public place in the center of the city.
Anyone could come by and listen to Zeno talk about a number of topics, from
human nature to duty, law, education, poetry, rhetoric, and ethics, among others.
(We know this because, although few of Zeno’s writings have survived, the titles
of his books are listed by Diogenes Laertius.) Zeno died at a very old age (one
source says he was ninety-eight), either of a fall or, having reckoned that he was
in pain and could no longer be useful to society, by committing suicide by
starvation.
After Cleanthes, Zeno’s pupil and the second head of the Stoa, came another
pivotal figure in the history of our philosophical movement: Chrysippus of Soli,
who was a long-distance runner before he turned to philosophy. He wrote many
books about all sorts of subjects (Diogenes Laertius mentions the incredible
figure of 705!) and, more importantly, introduced a great number of new ideas—
so many in fact that the ancients used to say that “but for Chrysippus, there had
been no Porch.”
Stoicism didn’t come out of nowhere, of course. The early Stoics were
heavily influenced by previous philosophical schools and thinkers, in particular
by Socrates and by the Cynics, but also by the Academics (followers of Plato)
(see the appendix for more on these different schools of thought). They spent a
significant amount of time engaging rivals in lively debate, especially the
Academics, the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), and of course the
Epicureans. Epictetus, for instance, devotes three entire chapters of the
Discourses to rebutting Epicurus. Each of these schools was “eudaimonic”—that
is, their objective was to figure out the best way of living a human life. Some
emphasized virtue (the Peripatetics, the Cynics, and the Stoics), and others
pleasure (the Epicureans, the Cyrenaics) while still others were more interested
in metaphysics (the Academics) or in the limits of human knowledge (the
Skeptics). All, however, aimed at the same goal: a flourishing existence.
This went on for a while, until in 155 BCE something very important
happened to ancient philosophy: the heads of the Stoa (Diogenes of Babylon),
the Academy, and the Peripatetic school were chosen as ambassadors to
represent Athens in political negotiations with Rome. The philosophers went to

the capital of the Republic to plead for the reduction of a fine that had been
imposed three years earlier on Athens for the sack of Oropus, a small Greek city
under Roman protection. The Athenians’ visit had a great cultural impact, far
beyond its diplomatic import: the philosophers gave packed lectures in the
capital, shocking the rather conservative Roman establishment and igniting an
interest in philosophy among the Romans for the first time.
Then, during the years 88–86 BCE, two philosophers, the Peripatetic Athenion
and the Epicurean Aristion, briefly in turn gained absolute power in Athens.
(Imagine that: a philosopher turned dictator!) However, they made the
strategically fatal mistake of siding with King Mithridates against the Romans,
an alliance that eventually led to the sack of Athens. The episode spelled the end
of that venerable city as the philosophical capital of the ancient world, as major
exponents of all schools moved to quieter places, including Rhodes, Alexandria,
and especially Rome itself. It was a pivotal moment in the history of Western
philosophy.
This transitional, second period of Stoic history is referred to as the “middle
Stoa.” The great Roman orator Cicero, who was sympathetic to Stoic ideas, is
one of our major sources for both the early and the middle Stoa. Eventually, the
Roman Republic—after the death of Julius Caesar and the ascent to power of
Octavian Augustus—gave way to the Empire. Stoicism thrived as a major school
during this time, known as the “late Stoa.” Active then were all the famous
Stoics whose writings have been preserved in sizable quantities: Gaius Musonius
Rufus (Epictetus’s teacher), Seneca (the adviser to the emperor Nero), Epictetus
himself, and the emperor-philosopher Marcus Aurelius.
By the time Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity in 312 CE, Stoicism
was in decline, as were a number of other schools of thought. Eventually, the
Byzantine emperor Justinian closed the Academy in 529 CE, thus ending the
ancient Greco-Roman philosophical tradition altogether. The idea of Stoicism,
however, survived in the writings of the many historical figures who were
influenced by it (including those who were sometimes critical of it), among them
some of the Early Church Fathers, Augustine, Boethius, Thomas Aquinas,
Giordano Bruno, Thomas More, Erasmus, Montaigne, Francis Bacon, Descartes,
Montesquieu, and Spinoza. Modern Existentialism and even neo-orthodox
Protestant theology have also been influenced by Stoicism. In the twentieth
century, Stoicism saw a resurgence after the Second World War, when, as we
have seen, it inspired Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy, Albert Ellis’s rational emotive
behavior therapy, and the broad family of cognitive behavioral therapies.

Although Stoicism was designed from the beginning as a very practical
philosophy, it would not be a “philosophy” if it were not based on a theoretical
framework of some sort. That framework is the idea that in order to live a good
(in the sense of eudaimonic) life, one has to understand two things: the nature of
the world (and by extension, one’s place in it) and the nature of human reasoning
(including when it fails, as it so often does).
An ancient student of Stoicism would probably have pursued these goals by
studying physics, logic, and ethics, although each of those terms meant
something a bit different from what we mean by them today. Stoic “physics” was
the study of how the world works, and it included what we today call the natural
sciences, plus metaphysics (nowadays a branch of philosophy) and even
theology. (The Stoics believed in God, though theirs was a material God
immanent in the cosmos.) Stoic “logic” included what we today call by that
name—that is, the study of formal reasoning, to which the ancient Stoics in fact
made fundamental contributions. But it also encompassed modern epistemology
(that is, a theory of knowledge), rhetoric (the study of how to best convey ideas
to others), and psychology (in particular an understanding of how the human
mind works and how and when it fails to reason properly).
The Stoics didn’t study physics and logic for their own sake. Like Socrates
before them—and unlike a number of other philosophers then and since—they
were not interested in theory for theory’s sake. If philosophy was not useful to
human life, then it wasn’t useful at all. But how exactly were physics and logic
connected to the goal of living the good life, which was the proper object of
study of Stoic ethics? It is illuminating to realize where our words “ethics” and
“morality” come from in the first place. “Ethics” derives from the Greek êthos, a
word related to our idea of character; “morality” comes from the Latin moralis,
which has to do with habits and customs. Indeed, moralis is how Cicero
translated the Greek word êthos! So the basic idea is that a good character cannot
be properly developed, and good habits practiced, without an understanding of
the other two areas of inquiry.
The Stoics used several metaphors to get their point across. One of the most
incisive is that of a garden, introduced by Chrysippus, who said that the fruits of
the garden represent the ethics. To get good fruits we must nurture the plants
with fine nutrients: the soil of the garden, then, is the physics, providing our
understanding of the world in which we live. Moreover, our “garden” needs to
be fenced off from unwanted and destructive influences, or it will be taken over
by weeds and nothing good will grow in it: the fence is the logic, keeping bad

reasoning out of the way.
Our friend Epictetus developed his own highly original take on why the three
Stoic areas of study are important:
There are three departments in which a man who is to be good and noble
must be trained. The first concerns the will to get and will to avoid; he
must be trained not to fail to get what he wills to get nor fall into what he
wills to avoid. The second is concerned with impulse to act and not to act,
and, in a word, the sphere of what is fitting: that we should act in order,
with due consideration, and with proper care. The object of the third is
that we may not be deceived, and may not judge at random, and generally
it is concerned with assent.
These are often referred to as the three Stoic disciplines: desire, action, and
assent. They are directly related to the three areas of study—as well as to the
four virtues (discussed in detail later)—in this way:

FIGURE 2.1. The relationships among the three
Stoic disciplines (desire, action, and
assent), the three areas of inquiry
(physics, ethics, and logic), and the four
cardinal virtues (courage, temperance,
justice, and practical wisdom).

This diagram encapsulates a lot of Stoic thought, and mastering it is an
excellent way to understand what the Stoics were after. The discipline of desire
(also referred to as Stoic acceptance) tells us what is and is not proper to want.

This, in turn, derives from the fact that some things are in our power and others
are not. We can appreciate that crucial difference from an understanding of how
the world works, as only people who are not schooled in physics make the
mistake of thinking that they control more than they actually do (that is, they
engage in wishful thinking). Two of the four Stoic virtues are pertinent to
regulating desire: courage (to face facts and act accordingly) and temperance (to
rein in our desires and make them commensurate with what is achievable). The
discipline of action (known also as Stoic philanthropy, in the sense of concern
for others) tells us how to behave in the world. It is the result of a proper
understanding of ethics, the study of how to live our lives, and it draws on the
virtue of justice. Finally, the discipline of assent (or Stoic mindfulness) tells us
how to react to situations, in the sense of either giving our assent to our initial
impressions of a situation or withdrawing it. This discipline is arrived at via the
study of logic—what is and is not reasonable to think—and requires the virtue of
practical wisdom.
This book is organized around the three disciplines. We will begin with desire
—what is and is not proper to want—by studying the fundamental Stoic
distinction between what is and what is not in our power, a distinction that in
turn provides us with a useful framework for guidance in all our major life
decisions. We’ll come to appreciate why the Stoics said that we should “follow
nature,” that is, understand human nature and our place in the cosmos; play ball
(metaphorically speaking) with Socrates to aid our good living by putting
external goods (health, wealth, education), or their lack, in the proper
perspective; and examine the Stoic take on God and purpose in the universe.
The second part of the book is devoted to the exploration of the discipline of
action, or how to behave in the world. We will see why the Stoics thought that
character is what matters the most, regardless of our circumstances; why they
held that people don’t really do evil but simply have misguided views of the
world that sometimes lead them to do awful things; why they considered role
models to be crucial for our education and inspiration, and how to choose good
ones; and how Stoicism can help people in very challenging situations, including
severe physical disability and mental illness.
The third section will tackle the discipline of assent, or how to best react to
situations. This discipline comes into play with a wide variety of everyday
problems, such as anger, anxiety, and loneliness, but also in positive aspects of
our lives, like friendship and love. We shall see how the Stoics prepared
themselves for the inevitable demise at the end of life and explore their

sophisticated and nuanced thinking about the delicate issue of suicide. Finally, I
will guide you through twelve selected spiritual exercises to get you started on
your way to becoming a good student of Stoicism and as good a person as you
can be.

PART I
THE DISCIPLINE OF DESIRE: WHAT IT IS
PROPER TO WANT OR NOT TO WANT

CHAPTER 3

SOME THINGS ARE IN OUR POWER, OTHERS ARE NOT

We must make the best of those things that are in our power, and take the
rest as nature gives it.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, I.1

I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES BACK IN 1990. I KNEW LITTLE of American culture
—other than what could be gleaned growing up watching Hollywood movies
and television series dubbed in Italian—and a close friend suggested that I start
my informal education by reading a short novel by Kurt Vonnegut.
Slaughterhouse-Five, published in 1969, is a strange work. The protagonist,
Billy Pilgrim, finds himself abducted by an alien race known as the
Tralfamadorians (or so he thinks), who put him in a zoo together with another
captured earthling, the porn star Montana Wildhack. The Tralfamadorians are
capable of moving in four dimensions—the standard three in space, plus time—
and so can revisit any moment of their lives as they wish. Billy picks up this
trick from his captors and then uses it to narrate crucial moments in his life,
including the controversial Allied bombing of Dresden near the end of World
War II.
It was while reading Slaughterhouse-Five that I first encountered these
words, which are framed in Billy’s optometry office on Earth and also inscribed
in a locket worn by Montana:
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.
This, of course, is the Serenity Prayer, which encapsulates our hero’s quest

throughout the book: Billy very much wants serenity, and he thinks he can
achieve it by recognizing that the past cannot be changed, that he can only affect
the here and now. This recognition takes courage—not the kind needed in battle,
but the more subtle, and yet arguably more important, kind needed to live your
life to your best.
The prayer in its modern form is attributed to Reinhold Niebuhr, an American
theologian who used it in his sermons as early as 1934. Today it’s best known
because of its use in the meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous and a number of
other twelve-step organizations. The same sentiment is detectable, however,
across centuries and cultures. Solomon ibn Gabirol, an eleventh-century Jewish
philosopher, expressed it this way: “And they said: At the head of all
understanding—is realizing what is and what cannot be, and the consoling of
what is not in our power to change.” Shantideva, an eighth-century Buddhist
scholar, similarly wrote: “If there’s a remedy when trouble strikes / What reason
is there for dejection? / And if there is no help for it / What use is there in being
glum?”
Yet there is an even more ancient version: “Make the best use of what is in
your power, and take the rest as it happens. Some things are up to us and some
things are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires,
aversions—in short, whatever is our own doing. Our bodies are not up to us, nor
are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices, or, that is, whatever is
not our own doing.” That one is found in Epictetus’s Enchiridion (or Handbook),
right at the beginning. Because this idea is foundational to Epictetus’s teachings,
and crucial to the whole system of Stoic philosophy going back to Zeno, we
begin our exploration of Stoicism by considering it in some detail.
The parallels between these teachings hint that the influence of Stoic wisdom
has been widespread, if often unrecognized, for many centuries. Moreover, some
of the key concepts of Stoicism are found in other philosophical and religious
traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism. Some of
these parallels are the result of direct or indirect reciprocal influence, and others
represent the independent convergence of wise minds reflecting on the human
condition. Although this book is concerned primarily with Stoicism, we will
repeatedly encounter ideas that have been proposed, rediscovered, and validated
through practice by people living in very different times and cultures. Since
these are ideas that have truly withstood the test of time, we would be wise to
draw from them in our own lives.
One day not so long ago, having recently reread Vonnegut’s novel, I was

walking in the Roman Forum and thinking about the words of my wise friend
Epictetus when it occurred to me that there was a problem: he was both
conceding too much and not enough. Epictetus lists our opinions, impulses,
desires, and aversions as “up to us,” and the condition of our bodies,
possessions, and reputations and the public offices we hold as not up to us. That
can’t be right, I told him. On the one hand, my opinions are influenced by other
people through what I read, or hear, or discuss. As for my impulses, desires, and
aversions, many of them seem to spring up naturally and instinctively, and all I
have available is some veto power when it comes to translating a thought into
action. (Confirming my thought, I was distracted at that very moment by some
gorgeous-looking gelato in a shop window, but I didn’t need it, and it wouldn’t
have been good for my waistline, so I refrained from getting it.) On the other
hand, I can certainly take care of my body by, say, going to the gym and eating
healthy food; I can decide what to acquire, within my financial limits; and my
reputation is also something I can work on, with colleagues, students, friends,
and family. Moreover, even though I do not hold public office, the decision
would certainly be mine if I were to seek it, as would my efforts to put myself
forth as a candidate and work on a campaign to gather votes.
I was in the midst of articulating all this to my Stoic master when I suddenly
realized that my twenty-first-century smugness had caught up with me. Of
course Epictetus knew all this. He was no intellectual slouch. He must have
meant something different from the literal reading of his words. I’m not sure
why this surprised me, since all texts need to be interpreted against some
background information. One needs guidance to provide some context, and
luckily I had the best one available right next to me during my walk in the
Forum. I asked him: “How do you make sense of my objection?” Epictetus’s
answer came, as it often does, by way of an analogy: “We act very much as if we
were on a voyage. What can I do? I can choose out the helmsman, the sailors,
the day, the moment. Then a storm arises. What do I care? I have fulfilled my
task: another has now to act, the helmsman. If the weather is bad for sailing, we
sit distracted and keep looking continually and ask, ‘What wind is blowing?’
‘The north wind.’ What have we to do with that? ‘When will the west wind
blow?’ When it so chooses, good sir.”
As is clear from Epictetus’s example, the so-called Stoic dichotomy of
control—some things are up to us, other things are not—is really a recognition
of three levels of influence that we have over the world. To begin with, we make
certain choices, selecting some goals (the sea voyage) and what appear to us to

be the best means to obtain them (the experienced sailors). Next, we need to
recognize that it does not follow from just having made a choice that we can
implement a given course of action. Our preferred helmsman, for instance, may
be sick on that day, or his services may be too expensive for us. Finally, some
factors are entirely out of our control and we cannot even begin to influence
them, like the direction and intensity of the winds.
As it happens, I experienced a harrowingly concrete case of Epictetus’s
analogy while writing this book. With one of my brothers, I flew from Rome to
London to a festival of music and philosophy. A lot about that trip was under our
control: our agreement to go, and our acceptance of the organizers’ choice of
airline (which supplied a specific plane and “helmsman”). What was entirely
outside of our control was what happened as we were about to land at Gatwick
Airport. We were close enough to the ground to distinctly see the landing strip
when suddenly the plane’s powerful engines roared and we felt a strong
acceleration: the Airbus had abruptly halted its descent and was rapidly gaining
altitude again. This was not a good sign, but the pilot played it cool. He came on
the speaker system and told us that, because of “a traffic issue,” we were going
to turn around and resume the landing procedure. That turned out to be a
euphemism for “almost landing on top of a plane that was still on the runway we
were supposed to use,” apparently unnoticed by the control tower! Only the
prompt reflexes of the pilot and the Airbus’s powerful engines had saved our
lives—neither of which factors, obviously, we had any means to affect. I only
knew what was happening because my neighbor, sitting by the window, told me
what was unfolding in real time. Yet throughout this incident I felt strangely
calm. I’d often wondered when something dangerous would happen during my
travels. “When it so chooses, good sir.” The old philosopher was right again.
One of Epictetus’s crucial points is that we have a strange tendency to worry
about, and concentrate our energies on, precisely those things we cannot control.
On the contrary, the Stoics say, we should pay attention to the parameters in
life’s equation that we do control or influence: making sure that we have
embarked on a voyage we really want to make, and for good reasons; spending
some time researching the best crew (airline) for our ship (plane); and making
related preparations. One of the first lessons from Stoicism, then, is to focus our
attention and efforts where we have the most power and then let the universe run
as it will. This will save us both a lot of energy and a lot of worry.
Another Stoic metaphor, from Cicero, may help illustrate the point. Consider
an archer trying to hit a target. Cicero explains that the archer has a number of

things under his control: he has decided how much to train and how intensely, he
has chosen a bow and an arrow as a function of the distance and type of target,
he has aimed as best as he can, and he has chosen the exact moment when to let
the arrow go. In other words, if he has been a conscientious archer, he has done
his best up to the moment when the arrow leaves his bow. Now the question is:
will the arrow hit the target? That, very clearly, is not up to him.
After all, a sudden gust of wind could alter the course of the arrow, which
would then miss the target altogether. Or something else might unexpectedly
interpose itself between the archer and the target, say, a carriage passing by.
Finally, the target itself might move away to avoid the flying weapon—
especially if the target is an enemy soldier. That is why Cicero concluded that
“the actual hitting of the mark [is] to be chosen but not to be desired,” a
superficially cryptic statement whose meaning should by now be fairly clear: the
Stoic archer has deliberately chosen to attempt to hit the mark, and he has done
the best he can do within his power to accomplish the goal. But he is also ready
to accept a possible negative outcome with equanimity, because the outcome was
never entirely under his control. Other variables entered into it—just as happens
in pretty much anything we decide to do.
It was at this point during our conversation that I realized that what Epictetus
was telling me had countless applications to my own life. Consider, for instance,
the degree of “control” we have over our own bodies. Ever since I was little, I
have struggled with my weight. I was a chubby kid and predictably the subject
of much teasing at school. I later developed into a somewhat insecure teenager,
particularly when it came to personal relationships, and especially with girls.
I’ve gotten better over time, but the weight issue is still with me, and always will
be. Yet a Stoic perspective is very helpful here. To begin with, I had no control
over either my genetic makeup (the result of a random encounter of one of my
father’s sperm with one of my mother’s eggs) or, just as crucially, my early
developmental environment. I ate whatever my grandparents (with whom I grew
up) gave me, in whatever quantities and at whatever frequencies they deemed
appropriate. As a biologist specializing precisely in the study of nature versus
nurture, I cannot stress enough just how much our habits are shaped by the early
interaction between our genes and the environment of our infancy and
childhood.
But this is no reason to give in to fatalism and helplessness. A critical part of
growing up and maturing as an adult is asserting more control over one’s life,
including choices concerning what to eat and how much, whether to exercise and

how diligently, and so forth. Thus, probably later than would have been ideal but
nonetheless with determination, I began exercising moderately more than fifteen
years ago, to maintain muscle tone and aerobic capacity. At approximately the
same time, I also started reading about the basics of nutrition, paying attention to
food labels, and generally trying to eat well and in moderation. I probably still
slip in these habits more often than I’d like to admit, but their results have been
clearly on the positive side: I am healthier and I look better, which in turn helps
me feel psychologically better. But I still do not have—and will never have—the
kind of slim and muscular body that for others is a natural gift, or that they are
able to achieve through their own strenuous efforts (facilitated by their genetics
and early development, of course). This used to be a nagging problem and
source of frustration for me. No more. I now have internalized the Stoic attitude
that I have control over some things (what I eat, whether to exercise), but not
others (my genes, my early experiences, and a number of other external factors,
including the efficacy of my exercise regime). So the outcome—the body that I
have, the degree of health that I enjoy—is to be accepted with equanimity; it is
“chosen, but not desired,” as Cicero put it. I derive satisfaction from knowing
that, quite irrespective of the actual outcome, I’m doing my best.
The Stoic dichotomy of control applies throughout our lives. Let’s say you
are up for a promotion at your job. You think it is reasonable that you will get it,
given how many years you have been with the company, the quality of your
performance reviews, and your good relationships with your coworkers and your
boss. Suppose you are going to find out tomorrow whether you got the
promotion or not. Adopting a Stoic approach will allow you to have a night of
peaceful sleep beforehand and be ready in the morning to face whatever outcome
comes your way, not with resignation but with confidence. Your confidence lies
not in the outcome, however, for that is outside of your control. The outcome
depends on too many variables, including the internal politics of your company,
your boss’s personal sympathy (or not) toward you, and how much competition
you may have from colleagues. No, your confidence lies in knowing that you did
whatever was in your power to do, because that, and only that, is under your
control. The universe doesn’t bow to your wishes, it does what it does; your
boss, your coworkers, the shareholders of your company, your customers, and a
number of other factors are part of the universe, so why would you expect them
to do your bidding?
Or imagine you are a parent with a teenage daughter who has suddenly
turned against you, despite a happy childhood and what you thought was a

wonderful relationship. The normal reaction might be regret, for perhaps not
having done everything possible when your daughter was younger, despite the
fact that you can’t really think of what else you might have done. You also feel
powerless to control the situation and frustrated by your previously happy child
simply not responding to you anymore, even seeming (at least momentarily) to
despise you. Epictetus tells us that regret is a waste of our emotional energy. We
cannot change the past—it is outside of our control. We can, and should, learn
from it, but the only situations we can do something about are those happening
here and now. The right attitude is to derive comfort from the knowledge that
you did your best in raising your daughter—indeed, that you are still doing your
best to help her through this difficult moment in her life. Whether you succeed or
not, your levelheaded acceptance of the outcome will be best.
Notice that I am not counseling resignation. Stoicism is too often
misinterpreted as a passive philosophy, yet resignation goes precisely against not
just what the Stoics themselves said but also, more importantly, what they
practiced. The Stoics we know of were teachers, politicians, generals, and
emperors—hardly the sort of people who would have fallen into a fatalistic
torpor. Rather, they were wise enough to make the distinction between their
internal goals, over which they had control, and the external outcome, which
they could influence but not control. As the Serenity Prayer says, it is the
hallmark of a mature and wise person to realize that difference.
I keep another famous story of Stoic equanimity in mind whenever I find
myself in difficult circumstances—which, luckily for me, are usually far less
challenging than those faced by the protagonist of the story. Paconius Agrippinus
was a first-century Stoic whose father had been put to death by the emperor
Tiberius, allegedly for treason. In the year 67 CE, Agrippinus faced the same
accusation (probably also unjustified) from another emperor, Nero. Epictetus
recounts what unfolded: “News was brought him, ‘Your trial is on in the Senate!’
‘Good luck to it, but the fifth hour is come’—this was the hour when he used to
take his exercise and have a cold bath—‘let us go and take exercise.’ When he
had taken his exercise they came and told him, ‘You are condemned.’ ‘Exile or
death?’ he asked. ‘Exile.’ ‘And my property?’ ‘It is not confiscated.’ ‘Well then,
let us go to Aricia and dine.’” Agrippinus’s reaction may sound cocky, the sort of
thing an unflappable hero in a Hollywood movie (perhaps played by Cary Grant,
or Harrison Ford) might say, but unlikely to ever be uttered by an actual human
being. And yet this is precisely the power of Stoicism: the internalization of the
basic truth that we can control our behaviors but not their outcomes—let alone

the outcomes of other people’s behaviors—leads to the calm acceptance of
whatever happens, secure in the knowledge that we have done our best given the
circumstances.
Incidentally, a friend of Agrippinus’s, the senator (and Stoic) Publius Clodius
Thrasea Paetus, was also accused by Nero’s sycophants and was not so lucky. He
was given the liberum mortis arbitrium, a free choice of death, as the Romans
euphemistically put it: he was ordered to commit suicide. Accordingly, he turned
to his dining companions and calmly excused himself, retired to his bedroom,
and invited the quaestor who had brought the emperor’s order to witness while
he slit his veins. He then awaited his death while conversing with his friend
Demetrius, a philosopher of the rival school of the Cynics, about the nature of
the soul.
Agrippinus and Thrasea were obviously rather exceptional human beings,
and thankfully many of us don’t live under the rule of a capricious tyrant—
though unfortunately, such leaders are still surprisingly common two millennia
after Nero. What is important is the basic idea of the dichotomy of control and
its implications. If we take this notion seriously, it turns out that most things are
not really under our control, from small and insignificant matters to really
important ones. The logical consequence of this realization—which is also
endorsed by Buddhism and other philosophical and religious traditions—should
be to practice non-attachment to things and people. This is a tricky idea, and
another source of common misconceptions about Stoicism. Here is how
Epictetus rather bluntly explained it to me (I later realized that he meant to
momentarily stun me in order to allow my mind to open up a bit and entertain a
notion that had been alien up to that point):
What then is the proper training for this? In the first place, the principal
and most important thing, on the very threshold so to speak, is that when
you are attached to a thing, not a thing which cannot be taken away but
anything like a water jug, or a crystal cup, you should bear in mind what it
is, that you may not be disturbed when it is broken. So should it be with
persons; if you kiss your child, or brother, or friend… you must remind
yourself that you love a mortal, and that nothing that you love is your very
own; it is given you for the moment, not for ever nor inseparably, but like
a fig or a bunch of grapes at the appointed season of the year, and if you
long for it in winter you are a fool. So too if you long for your son or your
friend, when it is not given you to have him, know that you are longing

for a fig in winter time.
Pause for a minute and reread that passage before continuing. Like most
people, I’m sure you can go along with what Epictetus says about attachment
when he is talking about jugs and crystal cups—sure, of course there is no need
to get attached to objects (even though a lot of us actually are!). After all, it is
just a cup (or an iPhone), and it’s no big deal if it breaks, even if it is an
expensive cup (there is no such thing as an inexpensive iPhone). But a good
number of us recoil in horror when the philosopher shifts his discourse to our
own child, brother, or friend. How inhuman, you might say, to advise people not
to care about their loved ones! What sort of sociopath could possibly make an
analogy between my brother and a fig, whether in or out of season?
And yet, once I had time to reflect on it for a moment, I saw that Epictetus
was not counseling me not to care for my loved ones, and moreover, that he was
saying something true, as hard as it may be to swallow. Stoicism originated and
thrived in times of political instability; people’s lives could be upturned at a
moment’s notice, and death could befall anyone, at any age. Even Emperor
Marcus Aurelius, who lived at the apogee of Roman power in the century
following Epictetus and was strongly influenced by the Greek philosopher, had
his share of misfortune. Of his thirteen children, only one son and four daughters
outlived their father. And this was a family that had by far the most material
comforts, the best food, and the highest-quality medical care the age could
afford. (Marcus’s personal physician was Galen, one of the most famous doctors
of antiquity.)
More to the point, as we have already seen, Epictetus himself adopted a
friend’s son, saving the boy from what otherwise would have been certain death.
So the philosopher clearly had compassion for other people and cared for them,
even some not related to him by blood. What Epictetus was telling me, then, was
that it is best to look the reality of life straight in the face, with courage. And that
reality includes the fact that no one is immortal, no one is “ours” in the sense
that we are entitled to him or her. Understanding this is not just a way to
maintain sanity when a loved one dies, or a dear friend leaves for another
country. (Exile was common then, just as moving for economic reasons or to
escape violence and turmoil is now.) Facing this reality also reminds us to enjoy
the company and love of our fellow humans as much as possible while we can,
trying hard not to take them for granted, because it is certain that one day we and
they will be gone and the only right “season” for appreciating them will have

passed. We always live hic et nunc—here and now.
The truth of this reality was bluntly shown to me by Fate this past summer,
when I spent three days in Istanbul despite the misgivings of some family
members, who had pointed out that the city was the site of a terrible terrorist
attack just days before I was to arrive in the country. But I reckoned—correctly,
as it turned out—that the likelihood of another attack so soon after that one,
especially with the predictably heightened security in the aftermath, would make
for an acceptably low risk. What I did not take into account, however, was the
possibility of political upheaval.
One evening I was having dinner with a few friends at a wonderful Cretan
restaurant in the historic district of Istanbul when I noticed that everyone at a
nearby table, one of the few still occupied so late, was staring intensely into their
phones. My immediate interpretation was that I was witnessing yet another
example of the damaging effect of modern technology: a preference for checking
Facebook over talking to dinner companions. But it soon became clear that I
should have denied assent (as the Stoics would say) to that first impression, since
these fellow diners were both too engrossed and too visibly concerned for that
explanation to be correct. As it turned out, they were following the news that a
coup was under way. The reaction at our table was remarkably calm as we
finished the wine and kept chatting. My Turkish friends related the history of
such events in their country and described the increasingly authoritarian and
strongly pro-Islamic government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At some point we had to decide what to do. There were rumors that all
bridges had been closed by the military; if true, that would have meant there was
no way for us to cross back to our hotel in central Istanbul. As it turned out, only
the two bridges on the Bosphorus, connecting the Asian and European sides,
were closed. So after failing to find a cab, we cautiously approached the bridge
on foot. We saw police cars blocking some streets and curious people hanging
around, wondering what to do. The good news was that social media networks
were still up (they never went down, in fact), so we could reassure our families
that we were okay, for now.
Indeed, the situation was eerily calm; people fished from the bridge while
smoking cigarettes, as they would have done any other night. Puzzled, we
reached our hotel and retired for the night. Over the next several hours we heard
helicopters and fighter jets overhead, accompanied at one point by two loud
explosions that turned out to come from nearby Taksim Square. But when we
woke up in the morning, all appeared to be almost normal, with people in the

streets (though not as many as usual) and coffee shops open (though not many
museums). The airport hadn’t reopened yet, so we kept a low profile, walking
the neighborhood and just reading and keeping an eye on the news until we were
told that our flight had been changed but was still scheduled to depart. We would
be making our way to the airport around midnight, headed for Paris and then
New York.
And here is where things got a bit more troubling. When we approached the
airport in a taxi, the streets were blocked by hundreds of people cheering the
failure of the coup, even though the whole thing had left thousands dead or
injured, mostly in the capital of Ankara and some smaller cities throughout the
country. As a general rule, it is not a good idea to be blocked in traffic in the
midst of a frenzied crowd, especially when you don’t speak the language. It’s
even more of a dispreferred indifferent when such a crowd is made up of mostly
young men roused by blood that has been shed in their own streets. And you
definitely don’t want to see your taxi driver starting to shout at another driver out
of frustration at not being able to move forward. In spite of these hazards, we
eventually made it to the terminal, checked in, and safely flew to Europe and
then to the United States.
To a student of Stoicism, the experience was first and foremost a strong
reminder of the fundamental principle of this chapter: few things are under our
control. I repeat that principle to myself every day and try to keep it constantly in
mind, but there is nothing like a sudden overturn of the social order to forcefully
bring the point home. Second, I was surprised at how calmly my companions
and I behaved throughout those twenty-four hours in Istanbul. True, we were
never in any apparent physical danger, but the situation was uncertain, and
especially once we heard explosions and military planes overhead a bit of
anxiety would not have been entirely out of place. Third, while driving through
the chanting crowd at the airport, I was reminded of just how easy it is to
manipulate people emotionally, playing on their fears and anger. It reinforced for
me the Stoic idea that such emotions should never be given assent, but always
kept in check in favor of developing more positive attitudes—such as, in this
case, by trying to rationally understand why events were unfolding as they were
and where the country was headed as a consequence. In Istanbul, the practice of
Stoicism served me well under very unusual circumstances, reinforcing the idea
that other people could benefit from it as well—even if they don’t find
themselves in the midst of a coup d’état.

CHAPTER 4

LIVING ACCORDING TO NATURE

Is our other statement then incredible—that man’s nature is civilized and
affectionate and trustworthy?
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, IV.1

THE STOICS WERE FAMOUS IN ANTIQUITY FOR INVENTING A lot of new words in order
to explain their philosophy to others, and also for being fond of short, pithy
phrases to remind themselves of their basic tenets whenever the need arose. One
such catchphrase, uttered in some form as early as Zeno of Citium, is that we
should live our lives “according to nature.”
What? I mockingly questioned Epictetus. Is Stoicism all of a sudden turning
out to be some sort of tree-hugging new-age thing? No, he calmly assured me:
“It is no ordinary task merely to fulfill man’s promise. For what is Man? A
rational animal, subject to death. At once we ask, from what does the rational
element distinguish us? From wild beasts. And from what else? From sheep and
the like. Look to it then that you do nothing like a wild beast, else you destroy
the Man in you and fail to fulfill his promise.”
That human beings are special in the animal world was perfectly clear to the
ancients. Aristotle, for one, famously said that we are the rational animal—
meaning not that we always behave rationally, since even cursory observation
proves that not to be the case, but rather that we are capable of rationality. He
also thought that we are political animals, meaning not that we engage in
political campaigns or discourse (although of course we do that as well), but that
we live and, more importantly, thrive in a polis—a community of other human
beings. From Aristotle’s insight that we are by nature both social and reasoning,
the Stoics derived the notion that human life is about the application of reason to
social living. The difference between Aristotle and the Stoics may seem subtle,
but it is crucial: Aristotle thought that contemplation is the highest purpose of

human life, because our unique function in the animal world is our ability to
think. As you might imagine, this purpose might make for a rather insular
existence, so the Stoics shifted the emphasis very much toward the social,
essentially arguing that the point of life for human beings is to use reason to
build the best society that it is humanly possible to build.
The problem these days is that the very idea of a human nature is now
somewhat in trouble. Both scientists and philosophers are increasingly
uncomfortable with the notion, and some reject it outright as the vestige of a
parochial worldview. Yet I think they are seriously mistaken in doing so.
Up until the mid-nineteenth century, people in the West thought that animals,
including humans, had been specially created, one by one, by an all-powerful
God. From this view, they didn’t have much trouble accepting what Aristotle
was saying on the matter, reinterpreted through the filter of their particular
religion: humanity is special because it is built in the image of God, and it has a
built-in purpose—carrying out whatever plan God has for the universe while at
the same time worshiping Him.
Along came Charles Darwin, who in 1859 published On the Origin of
Species. He and his colleague Alfred Russel Wallace independently amassed a
great deal of empirical evidence to buttress two revolutionary insights: first, that
all species on earth are related by common descent, like people in a family tree,
with brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles, and grandparents, reaching all the way
back to the origin of life; and second, that the bewildering variety of living forms
on earth, so exquisitely adapted to their diverse living conditions, are the result
of a fundamental process that they called “natural selection.” This process—
which has been studied and documented in both the field and the laboratory ever
since—works according to a remarkably simple algorithm. To begin with,
Darwin and Wallace noted that natural populations of animals and plants always
harbor a degree of variation in the characteristics of the individuals that make up
those populations: some are shorter, some taller; some produce greener leaves,
others less so; some are characterized by a fast metabolism, others by a slower
one; and so on. Second, it is often the case that distinct variants of any given trait
are more or less favorable in the particular environment in which the organism
happens to live. So, for instance, leaves of a certain shape are more suited to life
in the desert, where there is plenty of light but little water, while differently
shaped leaves are better adapted to life on the floor of the rain forest, where
water is abundant but light is scarce. In other words, these characteristics affect
the two things that really matter—biologically speaking—for any living being on

the planet: its survival and, even more crucially, its ability to reproduce. Finally,
there is a correlation between the characteristics of parents and their offspring,
because some traits are passed from generation to generation. (Darwin didn’t
know how this occurred, though the basic principle had been discovered at about
the same time by Gregor Mendel, whose work was not appreciated until 1900.)
If we combine these three elements—variation plus differential fitness plus
inheritance—we can deduce that, on average, fitter individuals are more likely to
survive and to produce more offspring, thus spreading their characteristics
throughout the population, at least until the environment changes and begins to
favor different characteristics. At that point, the process—which we call
“evolution by natural selection”—takes a new direction and continues on.
What does any of this have to do with human nature? The Darwinian theory
of evolution struck a deathblow to any account of humanity based on essential
characteristics, like the ones that both Aristotle and the Stoics (and pretty much
everyone else in antiquity) put forth. Epictetus was certainly right when he told
me: “From what does the rational element distinguish us? From wild beasts. And
from what else? From sheep and the like.” People are very different from “wild
beasts” and sheep. But are we so different from other primates, particularly the
great apes? Not really, according to modern biology. Our genome, to take one
measure of things, differs from that of chimpanzees by 4 to 5 percent. That is
still a lot, evolutionarily speaking, but I’m betting Aristotle would have been
surprised by how small that percentage is. Moreover, biologists have
systematically been finding that a long list of allegedly unique human traits are
actually not unique to us at all. We are not the only animals to live in
cooperatively social groups, nor the only ones to use tools. Nor are we the only
species with complex communication abilities, nor even the only ones displaying
what we would call moral behavior (which can be seen among bonobos and
other primates).
That said, we do seem to be the only animals who use language featuring
complex grammar, have babies who are born with very large brains and continue
to grow them long after birth, and have highly asymmetrical brain hemispheres,
which are specialized for different functions (including, very importantly,
language in the left one). We also have the largest brain-to-body ratio in the
mammalian world, and—this is an odd one—we are the only ape or Old World
monkey without a bone in our penis.
Looking at this (incomplete) list, you will notice that most of the entries are
quantitative, not qualitative. Our brains are larger and more asymmetrical, our

babies are bigger and grow longer after birth, and so forth. That is, these are
differences of degree, not kind, between us and other animals. Other entries
seem to be irrelevant to the point that Aristotle and the Stoics were making:
okay, we don’t have a penis bone, but that hardly has anything to do with our
rational faculties, philosophizing, or virtue. Perhaps our most promising
distinguishing trait is language, though even there people disagree on what
exactly constitutes a language, as distinct from other means of signaling and
communication.
But my rejection of biology-based skepticism about human nature does not
hinge on the quixotic search for a human essence. On the contrary, it is based on
embracing the findings of modern biology and taking them seriously. Research
has indeed shown that most or all characteristics separating different species of
living beings, including our own, are quantitative, lying along a
multidimensional continuum. But it has also clearly demonstrated that individual
members of the same species of complex, multicellular organisms—and
particularly vertebrates, of which we are an example—cluster much more tightly
together on that multidimensional continuum than they come close to similar
clusters of different species (with exceptions, because as every biologist will
readily tell you, the only law in biology is that one can always find exceptions).
This is a fancy way to say that you look and behave like a member of the species
Homo sapiens, and that it doesn’t take a biologist to tell you apart from your
closest evolutionary kin, Pan troglodytes (the chimpanzee). That is really all we
need to know to meaningfully talk about human nature: human beings are
sufficiently different from closely related species as to have their own
multidimensional set of distinguishing characteristics, and it just so happens that
a number of these traits have to do with our incredibly enhanced ability for
social cooperation, as well as with our gigantic brain power. And it is precisely
these two aspects of humanity—sociability and reason—that the Stoics insisted
on as the basis for their claim of human exceptionalism.
So much for the biology of human nature. But recently the idea of humans’
exceptionalness hasn’t fared well in some quarters of the humanities either,
especially in philosophy. The objections come from two lines of reasoning,
which we need to briefly examine before we can go back to our friend Epictetus.
Some philosophers simply deploy the same argument we have just examined,
arguing that Darwin dealt a deathblow to the idea of essentialism. Other
philosophers take the opposite route, relying not on genetics but on cultural
anthropology to conclude that humanity is so flexible in its behavior and

encompasses so much variability even across human cultures in both space and
time that we simply cannot meaningfully talk about a unified concept of human
nature.
The latter argument is a bit strange on two counts. First, if in fact human
culture was that variable, then that in itself would be a unique characteristic in
the animal world and would help—somewhat paradoxically—to distinguish
humans from other species. Second, and a bit more seriously, all human beings
do share quite a few traits that do not appear to be variable across cultures—an
indication that human behavioral plasticity is indeed limited. Some of these
shared traits include using a calendar (that is, purposefully keeping track of
time), developing a cosmology (explaining how the world is and how it came
about), engaging in divination, conducting funeral rites, adopting rules for the
inheritance of property, joking, displaying customs related to puberty, having a
concept of a soul or something like one, and tool-making. (Note that this list is
distinct from the list of characteristics that only humans have; for instance, other
species also engage in tool-making, of a sort.)
In the end, it seems that neither biological variation nor cultural diversity can
be reasonably deployed to reject what the ancients thought was obvious: we are
a very different species from anything else that planet Earth has produced over
billions of years of evolution, both for better (our stunning cultural and
technological achievements) and for worse (the environmental destruction and
the pain and suffering we have imposed on other species as well as on our own).
In particular—and this is the crucial point of interest to us here—what makes us
so different is not something as trivial as the absence of a bone. Rather, it is our
social and mental abilities—the very abilities that make it possible for me to
write the book you are reading, and that make you care about reading it.
We are now in a much better position to more accurately parse Epictetus’s
response to the questions with which we began this chapter: “For what is Man?
A rational animal, subject to death. At once we ask, from what does the rational
element distinguish us? From wild beasts. And from what else? From sheep and
the like.” His explanation to me continued: “See that you do not act like a sheep,
or else again the Man in you perishes. You ask how we act like sheep? When we
consult the belly, or our passions, when our actions are random or dirty or
inconsiderate, are we not falling away to the state of sheep? What do we
destroy? The faculty of reason. When our actions are combative, mischievous,
angry, and rude, do we not fall away and become wild beasts?” Epictetus is
affirming that what distinguishes humankind from all other species is our

capacity for rationality and arguing for an ethical precept as a result: we ought
not to behave like beasts or sheep because doing so negates our very humanity,
presumably the most precious (and natural!) thing we have. Perhaps you can
begin to see why “following nature” has nothing to do with tree-hugging.
But now we have another problem, philosophically speaking. Are Epictetus
and his fellow Stoics committing an elementary logical fallacy known as making
an “appeal to nature”? In other words, are they arguing that something is good
because it is natural, never mind that a good number of natural things are
actually quite bad for us? (Poisonous mushrooms come to mind.) The
problematic appeal to nature in the specific case of ethics has a long history,
which was crystallized by one of the major figures of the Enlightenment, the
Scottish philosopher David Hume. He observed what he thought was a peculiar
behavior:
In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have
always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary
ways of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes
observations concerning human affairs; when all of a sudden I am
surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is,
and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought,
or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last
consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation
or affirmation, ’tis necessary that it should be observed and explained; and
at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether
inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others,
which are entirely different from it.
This is now a classic passage in philosophy, and the problem Hume is
referring to is aptly called the is/ought gap. He is interpreted by some people
(those who emphasize “what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new
relation can be a deduction from others”) as saying that the gap cannot be
bridged, while others more modestly claim that he simply said that if an attempt
is made to bridge the gap, such a move needs to be justified (as in “’tis necessary
that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason
should be given”). Regardless of what Hume actually meant, I lean toward the
second position. It seems to me that ethics has to come from somewhere, and a
naturalistic account of it is the most promising approach. It is also the approach

used by all the Greco-Roman philosophies, and by Stoicism in particular.
In modern discussions of the roots of morality, there are, roughly speaking,
four ways to look at the issue, or what philosophers refer to as “meta-ethical”
positions: one can be a skeptic, a rationalist, an empiricist, or an intuitionist. If
you are a skeptic in this context, you are basically saying that there is no way to
know which ethical judgments are right or not. Often moral skeptics claim that
when people say, for instance, that “murder is wrong,” they are committing a
special kind of error (known as a category mistake): mixing up things that don’t
belong to each other, like a statement of fact (a murder was committed) and a
value judgment (something is wrong). Clearly, skeptics think that the is/ought
gap cannot be bridged, and that indeed facts have nothing whatsoever to do with
judgments. Needless to say, moral skeptics are not popular at dinner parties.
Rationalism is a general position in philosophy that maintains that it is
possible to arrive at knowledge by just thinking about stuff, as opposed to
observing or experimenting. Although this plays into the stereotype of the socalled armchair philosopher, don’t laugh too quickly: logicians and
mathematicians produce new knowledge by rationalist means all the time, so the
question really is whether ethics is anything like mathematics or logic. Some
people think so, while others disagree.
Often counterposed against rationalism is empiricism, the stance that we
ultimately arrive at knowledge on the basis of empirical facts—that is,
observations and experiments. Science is the ultimate empiricist discipline of
course, so to say that ethical knowledge can be arrived at empirically is to
attempt to somehow bridge the is/ought gap in a scientifically based way.
Finally, we have intuitionism, the proposition that ethical knowledge does not
require any kind of inference, whether by way of reason or observation. Instead,
it is sort of built into us in the form of strong intuitions about what is right and
wrong. How might that be? Well, for instance, I mentioned that other primates
exhibit proto-moral behaviors, such as helping nonkin who appear to be in
danger or distress. Presumably bonobo chimpanzees don’t exhibit this behavior
because they have read philosophical treatises on right and wrong. They simply
act instinctively, and that instinct was probably built into them by natural
selection because it fosters prosocial behavior, which is crucial for the survival
of small groups of primates. Because we share a recent common ancestor with
the bonobos, and because our own ancestors also lived in small bands in which
prosocial behavior was adaptive, it is not too much of a stretch to think that we
do indeed have a moral instinct, and that we have inherited it from primates that

preceded us.
The Stoic approach to ethics is interesting because it doesn’t actually fit these
four neat categories. Indeed, Stoic doctrine can be thought of as a combination
of intuitionism, empiricism, and rationalism. The Stoics, however, were most
definitely not skeptics. Stoics held a “developmental” theory of ethical concern,
according to which we begin life guided only by instincts (not reason), and those
instincts favor both self-regard and regard for the people with whom we interact
daily, usually our parents, siblings, and more or less extended family. Up to that
point, we are essentially behaving like pure intuitionists, with our ethical
intuitions built into our very nature as humans.
Gradually, we are taught to expand our concern as we approach the age of
reason—roughly speaking, when we are six-to eight-year-old children. At that
point, we begin to make clearer distinctions between our thoughts and our
actions and to have a better grasp of the world and of our place in it. From this
point on, our instincts are enhanced, and sometimes even corrected, by a
combination of self-reflection and experience—that is, by both rationalist and
empiricist processes. The Stoics thought that the more we mature
psychologically and intellectually the more the balance should shift away from
our instincts and toward the deployment of (empirically informed) reasoning.
During our conversation, Epictetus explained to me that it is “the nature of the
rational animal, that he can attain nothing good for himself, unless he contributes
some service to the community. So it turns out that to do everything for his own
sake is not unsocial.” That brought us back to human nature: Epictetus was
telling me that a fundamental aspect of being human is that we are social, not
just in the sense that we like the company of others, but in the deeper sense that
we couldn’t really exist without the help of others; the implication is that when
we do things for the good of the polity, we are actually (perhaps indirectly)
benefiting ourselves. This is a remarkably insightful account of humanity, one
that fits well with the discovery, sixteen centuries after Epictetus, that human
beings in fact evolved as a type of social primate, sharing adaptive prosocial
instincts with our cousins on the evolutionary tree.
But it is another second-century Stoic philosopher, Hierocles, who perhaps
best synthesized the school’s thinking on these matters in his Elements of Ethics,
of which, unfortunately, only fragments remain. (We also don’t know much
about Hierocles himself, except that Aulus Gellius described him as a “grave and
holy man.”) Here is how he puts it:

Each of us is, as it were, circumscribed by many circles.… The first,
indeed, and most proximate circle is that which everyone describes about
his own mind as a centre.… The second from this, and which is at a
greater distance from the centre, but comprehends the first circle, is that in
which parents, brothers, wife, and children are arranged.… Next to this is
that which contains the common people, then that which comprehends
those of the same tribe, afterwards that which contains the citizens.… But
the outermost and greatest circle, and which comprehends all the other
circles, is that of the whole human race.… It is the province of him who
strives to conduct himself properly in each of these connections to collect,
in a certain respect, the circles, as it were, to one centre, and always to
endeavor earnestly to transfer himself from the comprehending circles to
the several particulars which they comprehend.
Being a Stoic, and hence of a practical bent, Hierocles even suggested how to
behave in a way that helps us internalize the concept that the people in the
various circles are of concern to us. For instance, he advised his students to refer
to strangers as “brother” or “sister” or, if they were older, as “uncle” or “aunt,”
as a constant reminder that we should treat other people as if they really are our
relatives, as reason counsels that we are all in the same boat together, so to
speak. Even today a number of cultures have similar customs, having
independently arrived at Hierocles’s insight into human psychology.

FIGURE 4.1. The Stoic idea of
cosmopolitanism, visualized as
contracting circles of concern, according
to the second-century philosopher

Hierocles. The idea is to train ourselves to
treat people in the outer circles the way
we treat people from the inner circles.

The Stoics perfected this idea of ethical development and called it oikeiôsis,
which is often translated as “familiarization with” or “appropriation of” other
people’s concerns as if they were our own. This led them (and the Cynics who
immediately preceded them and influenced them greatly) to coin and use a word
that is still crucial to our modern vocabulary: cosmopolitanism, which literally
means “being a citizen of the world.” Or as Socrates—arguably the most
important influence on all Hellenistic schools of philosophy—put it: “Never…
reply to one who asks [your] country, ‘I am an Athenian,’ or ‘I am a Corinthian,’
but ‘I am a citizen of the universe.’”

CHAPTER 5

PLAYING BALL WITH SOCRATES

Material things are indifferent, but how we handle them is not indifferent.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, II.5

WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT “LIVING ACCORDING TO NATURE” in the previous chapter, I
mentioned that the Stoics had a fondness for pithy summaries of their
philosophy. I find this to be an endearing aspect of their thinking, for a couple of
reasons. First, it is a forceful reminder that they were interested in practice, not
just theory: their aphorisms were meant to benefit the prokoptôn, that is, to help
the student of Stoicism make progress. Unlike modern bumper stickers, T-shirt
slogans, and so forth, which primarily signal membership in a particular group
and tend to be used as a metaphorical club with which to beat those who are not
like-minded, Stoic stock phrases were employed by practitioners as personal
reminders, as aids for daily meditation, or as a guide to behavior when they were
in doubt. Stoicism, in other words, was not meant to be worn on your sleeve
(unless you were someone, say a teacher, who couldn’t avoid doing so). Marcus
Aurelius carried this attitude to the extreme: his famous Meditations were
written as a personal diary of reflection, not as a book meant for publication, and
in antiquity the work was known as Ta Eis Heauton, which simply means “To
Himself.”
I also like Stoic aphorisms because these short sentences are often
superficially paradoxical and can be taken in one of two ways: on the one hand,
as a perennial source of frustration, since the Stoic must constantly explain
herself to others who keep misunderstanding what her philosophy is about, and
on the other hand, as an opportunity for a teaching moment: asked about one of
these “paradoxes,” the Stoic has the perfect opening to move from the bumper
sticker level to at least the level of an elevator speech, which seems to be the
most that much modern conversation allows, be it in person or on social media.

Perhaps the most paradoxical of these phrases is “preferred indifferents” (and
“dispreferred indifferents”). Since the category “indifferent” pretty much
encompasses everything outside of an individual’s excellence of character, or
virtue, then we better get clear on what exactly the Stoics meant by this.
As usual, I asked Epictetus to clarify, this time during a nice walk in the
Casal Palocco area of Rome, where there happens to be a street named after him.
(That surprised the hell out of my friend, who is very modest by nature.) As he
often does, he referred me to Socrates, who was a major influence on Stoic
thought: “[Socrates] was like one playing at ball. What then was the ball that he
played with? Life, imprisonment, exile, taking poison, being deprived of his
wife, leaving his children orphans. These were the things he played with, but
none the less he played and tossed the ball with balance. So we ought to play the
game, so to speak, with all possible care and skill, but treat the ball itself as
indifferent.”
Let me unpack this analogy, which is clearly between one’s life and playing
ball. I’m not sure which game Epictetus was referring to, but let’s say it was
Greco-Roman soccer. The point of the analogy is that the ball itself, though
central to the game and apparently the focus of everyone’s attention, is actually
indifferent—meaning that it could take a variety of colors and shapes, be made
of different materials, or be of different sizes, but it isn’t valuable in itself. The
ball is only a means to an end and isn’t the important thing—it is what one does
with the ball that defines the game, how well it is played, and who wins or loses.
Indeed, a good player does not have rigid ideas about how to handle the ball,
when or to whom to pass it, and so on. The best players are those who display
fantasia (creativity), who are imaginative about what they do on the field, and
who find new ways to turn difficult situations to their favor, making the obstacle
the way, to paraphrase Marcus Aurelius. Moreover, the hallmark of an admirable
player isn’t that he wins games, but that he plays his best regardless of the final
outcome, which, after all, is not under his control.
Likewise with Socrates: Fate handed him certain materials to play with,
including the time and place of his birth, the political system and situation of
Athens in the fifth century BCE, and so forth. He strove to live a good life, doing
his military duty during the Peloponnesian War and teaching his fellow citizens
about philosophy. When Meletus, with the shady support of Anytus and Lycon,
accused him of “impiety” (that is, not believing in the state’s official gods), he
stood in front of his fellow citizens to argue his case—even though it was clear
that the charges stemmed from a combination of political and personal vendettas

on the part of his accusers.
After he was condemned to death by the tribunal of the people, Socrates had
an easy opportunity to escape thanks to his friends, who were more than willing
to bribe the guards (a rather common practice, and not only in those times).
Instead, he turned the occasion into an explanation of his duties toward the city
that had given him birth and nurtured him his whole life. In Plato’s Crito,
Socrates tells his distraught friends that he has a moral duty to accept the law
even when it is patently misused, because we don’t get to change the rules when
they happen not to suit us. He is therefore willing to take the poison and leave
his friends, students, wife, and child in order not to compromise his integrity,
which is the important thing; all else is “indifferent,” not in the sense that
Socrates didn’t care about his friends and family (or, for that matter, his own
life), but in the deeper sense that he was not willing to compromise his virtue in
order to save his skin, or even to spare his loved ones suffering. As Epictetus
told me during our conversation: “How do I know what is going to turn up? My
business is to use what does turn up with diligence and skill.… It is for you,
then, to take what is given you and make the most of it.”
A modern-day analogy may be made here with the American whistleblower
Edward Snowden. As is well known, Snowden was a contractor for the US
National Security Agency. In 2013 he released a number of classified documents
that exposed a broad, and arguably illegal, surveillance system enacted by the
NSA, which has since led to a much-needed debate on the balance between
surveillance and democratic values in an open society. Predictably, the very
mention of Snowden tends to generate polarized responses, just as Socrates’s
name did in his time: for some he is a hero, for others a traitor, and in fact he
may well be considered both. Quite irrespectively of whether what Snowden did
was morally right or not—again, similar to the question of whether Socrates’s
teachings and political actions were right or not—we can reasonably wonder
about the ethics of Snowden seeking asylum abroad (at the moment of this
writing in Russia, of all places) rather than facing the two charges of violating
the 1917 Espionage Act that the US government has leveled against him. I
honestly do not know the answer. Socrates decided to stay, and Snowden decided
not to return, but even if you think that Snowden should have faced the
consequences (right or not) of his actions, we can all probably agree that few
people have risen to the moral stature of Socrates—which is why he is one of the
standard role models used by Stoics.
Luckily, most of us will not face the morally treacherous terrain on which

Socrates and Snowden found themselves. Nonetheless, we have plenty of
opportunities to decide how to play the balls thrown in our direction by life. Let
me give you a couple of trivial examples. Not long after my conversation with
Epictetus, I happened to need some cash for personal expenses, so I went around
the corner from my apartment in New York, accessed the ATM of the local
branch of my bank, and got the money. And then I froze in my tracks. You see, if
you hang around Stoics, you soon discover that everything has an ethical
dimension. In this case, I suddenly remembered that my bank had notoriously
been involved in a number of shady practices (for example, questionable
investments and financial tools), directed toward both their own employees and
society at large. That meant that my preferred indifferent—being able to
conveniently get cash from my account whenever I need it—was actually in
tension with my implicit support of labor and social practices that I oppose in
principle. Oops.
As a result of that reflection, I walked into the bank’s branch and explained to
a baffled customer representative that I was closing my account, not because I
was dissatisfied with the level of service (which was actually excellent), but
because I had irreconcilable differences with the bank about how they were
using what was, after all, my money. I then did some research and found a bank
that, though most certainly not ethically impeccable, was unquestionably better
than the one I had just ditched. I brought my business to them, and I have been
feeling a little better ever since.
Similarly, I grew up a complete omnivore in Italy, with parents and
grandparents who couldn’t really wrap their minds around the word
“vegetarian.” I am not a vegetarian even today, but I’ve gradually started paying
more attention to where my food comes from, and at what cost in terms of
animal suffering, environmental impact, and human labor. It is a complex
problem, with no easy solution and plenty of conflicts among distinct
indifferents. For instance, contra to the standard vegetarian argument, it is not at
all easy to calculate just how many animals suffer and die when you take up a
vegetarian diet, because large-scale cultivation of plant species for human
consumption radically alters the environment of the planet, depriving a number
of wild animal species of vital ecological space. If you think that eating local and
organic is sustainable, you may be in for a surprise when you look at the relevant
literature or do a bit of back-of-the-envelope calculation. Even the activistjournalist Michael Pollan, author of the best-selling The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A
Natural History of Four Meals, agrees that we cannot feed billions of people on

the kind of diet that he and I can afford and easily find at our local green grocery
shops. Then again, to argue that we have a right to eat whatever we fancy,
regardless of the demonstrably immense levels of suffering and environmental
damage we inflict in the process, seems more than a bit callous.
This dilemma is probably why a number of Stoics were in fact vegetarian.
Take Seneca, who wrote that “I was imbued with this [vegetarian] teaching, and
began to abstain from animal food; at the end of the year the habit was as
pleasant as it was easy. I was beginning to feel that my mind was more active.”
Seneca eventually abandoned vegetarianism because he did not want to be
associated with a particular political faction that had adopted the practice. Was
he then just an opportunist, or at the very least morally weak? Not necessarily.
We do not know the details, but he may have calculated that sticking to a
vegetarian diet would have done less good for the world (which for him meant,
of course, Roman society) than choosing to differentiate himself from that
particular political party. Being vegetarian, in and of itself, is no proof of
superior moral quality, but it is a good thing to do if other considerations do not
outweigh that choice. And it is the hallmark of a wise person to be able to
navigate a complex situation otherwise characterized by no easily identifiable,
optimal course of action.
Musonius Rufus, Epictetus’s teacher, was famous for being a particularly
practical Stoic who gave his students advice on everything from the important
things in life (such as the idea that women ought to get the same education as
men) to somewhat trivial matters, like how to furnish your house (efficiently,
with stuff that doesn’t break easily) or cut your hair (removing only what is
useless). He had a lot to say about diet too. He argued that “although there are
many pleasures which persuade human beings to do wrong and compel them to
act against their own interests, the pleasure connected with food is undoubtedly
the most difficult of all pleasures to combat,” adding: “To obtain those few
moments of gastronomic pleasure, countless expensive foods must be prepared
and brought overseas from distant lands. Cooks are more highly valued than
farmers. Some people spend all their possessions to have their banquets
prepared, but they are not made stronger by eating these expensive foods.…
When it comes to food, responsible people favor what is easy to obtain over
what is difficult, what involves no trouble over what does, and what is available
over what isn’t.”
Now this strikes very close to home for me, and it is an excellent example of
how the Stoics saw life’s preferred indifferents. As I mentioned, I grew up in

Rome and live in New York. Indeed, I am writing this book during a sabbatical
from my home institution, a leave of absence that I’m spending in the Eternal
City, partly to get inspired by almost daily walks to the Colosseum, the Forum,
and other sights, but partly to enjoy the company of my family and, yes, the
delicious food my hometown readily offers! My partner and I also take
advantage of all the good restaurants in the Big Apple, including a number of
expensive ones where the cooks are definitely better paid than the farmers and
where, to obtain a few moments of gastronomic pleasure, countless expensive
foods must be prepared and brought overseas from distant lands. It seems like
my choices at this point are rather limited, and somewhat unpleasant: either I
should frankly admit that for all this talk about Stoicism, I’m actually an
epicurean (in the modern, small-e sense of the word) and therefore a hypocrite,
or I should give up fine dining in the name of logical consistency, thus relegating
myself to what others may consider a joyless life while surrounded by culinary
pleasures of all kinds in which I refuse to partake.
But one of the first things you learn if you study philosophy is that there
rarely is such a thing as a sharp dichotomy in any but the more trivial matters. In
fact, when I teach informal logic, I warn my students that more often than not, if
someone is presenting them with just one of two forced choices, that person is
probably committing what is called the fallacy of false dichotomy—he’s not
telling them that other options are available. (Of course, in some cases there
really are only two options, and being forced to face a narrow choice is no
logical error, but the general point holds.) In this case, for instance, cheap,
delicious, and healthy meals can be found in Rome, prepared by local cooks
using seasonally available ingredients—thus satisfying Musonius’s
requirements. It is also possible to find such meals in New York, of course, but
there the temptation to splurge on seriously (perhaps outrageously) expensive
meals, which are far better described as “culinary experiences,” is great. That is
where I decided to draw the line, within limits. I told my partner and my closest
friends that I’d rather not go to, say, Eleven Madison Park, if it could be avoided.
Which of course is possible most of the time. But not all the time: if a dear
friend, or my companion, were to tell me that once in a lifetime they really want
to have the Eleven Madison Park experience—say, to celebrate a very special
occasion—and would be greatly disappointed if I didn’t join them, I might
consider it. That’s not hypocrisy or rationalization, I think, but rather a balancing
of competing demands that stem from different ethical criteria: supporting a type
of operation of which I do not approve versus disappointing someone I love.

(Remember that I am using the Greco-Roman understanding of “ethics,” which
had a much broader meaning than the modern word.) The reasonable thing to do
—and Stoics were all about applying reason to everyday affairs—might be to
compromise: yes, we’ll go this one time, but we’ll make up for it in some
fashion, like doubling our efforts to patronize locally sourced and
environmentally and labor friendly eateries for the rest of the year. Will I feel
uncomfortable during that evening of celebration? Probably, but as the emperor
Marcus Aurelius said—and he wasn’t kidding or being sarcastic—“If [you] must
live in a palace, then [you] can also live well in a palace.”
Generally speaking, then, Stoic ethics isn’t just about what we do—our
actions—but more broadly about how our character is equipped to navigate real
life. We live in far too intricate social environments to be able to always do the
right thing, or even to do the right thing often enough to know with sufficient
confidence what the right thing is to begin with. Most of the different demands
made on us have an ethical dimension (animal suffering, environmental damage,
the treatment of waiters), but some are also more practical (I need to eat, but
where is my food coming from? I need to bank, but which bank am I
supporting?). Stoicism is about developing the tools to deal as effectively as
humanly possible with the ensuing conflicts, does not demand perfection, and
does not provide specific answers: those are for fools (Epictetus’s word) who
think the world is black and white, good versus evil, where it is always possible
to clearly tell the good guys from the bad guys. That is not the world we live in,
and to pretend otherwise is more than a bit dangerous and not at all wise.
That said, let me return to the idea of indifferents, and their classification as
“preferred” or “dispreferred,” by contrasting Stoicism with two other important
Hellenistic schools of thought: Aristotelianism and Cynicism (the latter being a
word that, even more so than Stoicism and Epicureanism, has a different
meaning today than it did then—which is why I capitalize the words in reference
to the philosophies and lowercase them otherwise).
Aristotle was a student of Plato (and hence a grand-student of Socrates, so to
speak), and his philosophy was characterized by a very practical, if somewhat
elitist, approach. In his version of virtue ethics, a eudaimonic life is made
possible by the pursuit of virtue, but we also need many other things over which
we have no control: health, wealth, education, and even good looks.
Contrast this with the thinking of the first Cynic, Antisthenes, himself a
student of Socrates. Antisthenes, and even more so his famous successor,
Diogenes of Sinope, went radical: for them, nothing is necessary for a

eudaimonic life except virtue. We may be healthy or sick, wealthy or poor,
educated or ignorant, handsome or ugly—none of it matters. Indeed, they went
so far as to argue that earthly possessions positively get in the way of virtue: they
develop in us an attachment to things that don’t matter, so we are better off
without them.
Diogenes seriously practiced what he preached. His lifestyle could be
characterized as in-your-face ascetic, as he made a show of sleeping in a tub in
the streets of Athens, defecating and copulating in public (hence the term
“Cynic,” which means doglike), and carrying little or nothing for his own
survival and comfort. There are wonderful stories about Diogenes. One tells us
that he was thirsty one day, and so pulled out a bowl while approaching some
running water. He then saw a boy helping himself to the water by simply
cupping his hands to hold the liquid. Diogenes threw away his bowl in disgust,
muttering that even a boy was wiser than him. On another occasion, he was
visited by Alexander the Great, who had heard of the famous philosopher and
went to pay his respects (presumably, in front of the tub). When Alexander
magnanimously (or so he thought) asked Diogenes what he, the most powerful
man in the world, could do on behalf of the philosopher, the latter looked up and
said something along the lines of “you could move, you are blocking my sun.”
That ought to give you an idea of why the Cynics were both much admired and
much despised.
Now here is the problem: On the one hand, we have Aristotle telling us that
eudaimonia can be achieved only by somewhat lucky people who fit a number of
prerequisites, acquired through little or no merit of their own. On the other hand,
we’ve got the Cynics not only rejecting Aristotle’s list of necessary prerequisites
but arguing that they get in the way of a good life. Stoics occupy the logical
space in between these two positions: health, wealth, education, and good looks
—among other things—are preferred indifferents, while their opposites—and a
number of other things—are dispreferred indifferents. This, I think, was a stroke
of genius. The Stoics made a eudaimonic life a reachable goal for everyone,
regardless of social status, financial resources, physical health, or degree of
attractiveness. Although all of these qualities are indifferent to your ability to
pursue a virtuous life—to become a morally worthy person—they are still
preferred (just as any normal human being would readily tell you) so long as
they don’t get in the way of your practice of the virtues. Here is how Seneca
aptly summarized the idea in the case of a particularly common contrast between
preferred and dispreferred experiences: “There is great difference between joy

and pain; if I am asked to choose, I shall seek the former and avoid the latter.
The former is according to nature, the latter contrary to it. So long as they are
rated by this standard, there is a great gulf between; but when it comes to a
question of the virtue involved, the virtue in each case is the same, whether it
comes through joy or through sorrow.” In other words, by all means go ahead
and avoid pain and experience joy in your life—but not when doing so imperils
your integrity. Better to endure pain in an honorable manner than to seek joy in a
shameful one.
There is a way to understand this point in very modern parlance, using the
language of economic theory, of all things. Economists have developed the
concept of lexicographic preferences, so called because they work in a fashion
similar to the ordering of words in a dictionary to describe situations where
people want incommensurable goods—that is, goods that cannot be compared to
each other in terms of value. Let’s say that I value goods 1 and 2, which belong
to category A, but also goods 3, 4, and 5, which belong to category B. While 1
and 2 can be compared and contrasted, and the same goes for 3, 4, and 5, no
good belonging to A is comparable to any good belonging to B, and anything
from A has complete precedence over anything from B. The result is that goods
can be traded within either A or B, but not across these categories. Here the
pursuit of virtue is in category A, while the preferred indifferents are in category
B. Within B, you may well trade things off: money for education, a good career
for family life, and so forth. But for a Stoic, there is no trade-off between A and
B: nothing can be traded if the price is the compromising of your character. This,
incidentally, means that there are contrasts between goods—such as virtue versus
physical health—to which standard economic theory simply does not apply.
This may sound strange, but a moment’s reflection will show that we all
already use lexicographic indexing for many of our choices. You might like, say,
the idea of going on vacation in a nice resort in the Caribbean. And because
going on vacation and spending money are on the same lexicographical level,
you are willing to trade off some of your hard-earned money in order to achieve
that goal. But I assume that you wouldn’t sell your daughter for any purpose at
all, and certainly not just to enjoy a vacation. That’s because your daughter
belongs to a higher lexicographical level, one that is incommensurable with
vacations, as pleasant and needed as the latter may be.
Regardless of whether we express it in philosophical or economic terms, this
Stoic concept is quite empowering. If you follow Aristotle (and, let’s be frank, a
lot of what passes for common sense), you need to be part of the lucky elite or

you won’t have a good life. This outlook puts most people on the perennially
losing side of things, condemning them to the pursuit of material goods because
they mistakenly think that their happiness and worth depend on acquiring them.
Psychologists call this the hedonic treadmill: you keep running, but you ain’t
goin’ nowhere. By contrast, everyone can have a good life according to the
Cynics, but few of us are inclined to spend it living in a tub and defecating in the
streets. The Stoic compromise—their lexicographic contrast between the virtues
and the preferred indifferents, coupled with their treatment of the two as
hierarchically ordered, incommensurable classes of goods—brilliantly
overcomes the problem, retaining the best of both (philosophical) worlds.

CHAPTER 6

GOD OR ATOMS?

What then is the nature of God? Is it flesh? God forbid. Land? God forbid.
Fame? God forbid.
It is intelligence, knowledge, right reason.
In these then and nowhere else seek the true nature of the good.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, II.8

I DO HAVE A MAJOR DISAGREEMENT WITH MY FRIEND EPICTETUS, and yet the fact that
we can have such diverging opinions on a fundamental matter and still see eye to
eye about how to live our lives is one of the most precious features of Stoicism:
it makes room for both religious believers and unbelievers, united by their
common understanding of ethics regardless of their diverging metaphysics.
When I asked Epictetus about his view of God, he replied: “Who is it that has
fitted the sword to the scabbard and the scabbard to the sword? Is there no one?
Surely the very structure of such finished products leads us commonly to infer
that they must be the work of some craftsman, and are not constructed at
random. Are we to say then that each of these products points to the craftsman,
but that things visible and vision and light do not? Do not male and female and
the desire of union and the power to use the organs adapted for it—do not these
point to the craftsman?” This is a remarkable early example (since it was written
in the second century CE) of what is known as the argument from design to
support the existence of God. A variation of it was later used by prominent
Christian theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas, and it is perhaps best known in
the formulation of the nineteenth-century natural theologian William Paley, who
articulated it just a few decades before Darwin wrote On the Origin of Species:
In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were
asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for

anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it
perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I
had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the
watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I
had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always
been there.… There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or
other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose
which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction,
and designed its use.… Every indication of contrivance, every
manifestation of design, which existed in the watch, exists in the works of
nature; with the difference, on the side of nature, of being greater or more,
and that in a degree which exceeds all computation.
The argument is intuitively very powerful, and likely to be brought up by
most believers as a first response to the question of why they believe. It is also,
predictably, the argument against which atheists have often concentrated most of
their firepower. It is not my intention to convince the reader one way or the
other, as this book isn’t about apologetics, and even less so about atheism. I
would be intellectually dishonest, however, if I did not put forth my own
opinion, just as I did during my friendly chat with Epictetus. This is what good
philosophers—and reasonable people in general—are supposed to do: listen to
each other’s arguments, learn and reflect, and go out for a beer to talk it over
some more.
My considered opinion is that Epictetus’s argument (and Aquinas’s and
Paley’s) was eminently reasonable until sometime between the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. What happened then was that two brilliant minds, one a
philosopher, the other a scientist, dealt a powerful double punch to the argument
from design. Those punches did not deliver a win by knockout (that rarely
happens in philosophy), but I think the argument, though still vigorously
defended by a number of theologians, philosophers, and even some scientists,
has lost a significant amount of its appeal.
The first cogent attack on the argument from design came from David Hume,
who wrote: “If we see a house… we conclude, with the greatest certainty, that it
had an architect or builder because this is precisely that species of effect which
we have experienced to proceed from that species of cause. But surely you will
not affirm that the universe bears such a resemblance to a house that we can with
the same certainty infer a similar cause, or that the analogy is here entire and

perfect.” Hume’s point is subtle but crucial: he is basically saying that arguments
from analogies, of which the one from design is an example, are notoriously
problematic because analogies are always imperfect, and in some cases
downright misleading.
More precisely, Hume acknowledges that if we see a manufactured object, we
are justified in inferring the existence of a human maker, but only because we
have actually seen, or have otherwise incontrovertible evidence of, people
making things. In the case of the universe, however, we have never seen one
being created, nor do we have any knowledge of the existence of a Creator to
begin with—indeed, that is precisely the point under contention: how did the
cosmos come about? Moreover, if a Creator does exist, we have no idea of its
attributes. Accordingly, Hume continued with a bit of mischievousness (which
was dangerous at the time when he was writing). If we take the analogy between
human and cosmic designers seriously, he argued, then we have to conclude that
the latter have the following properties: there are many of them, they are fallible,
and they are mortal—all suggestions that do not go at all well with a standard
Christian theological account of God.
Although Hume developed a powerful counterargument against the appeal to
design—one that is still studied in introductory philosophy courses today—he
was missing something rather big: an alternative explanation for the undeniable
appearance of design in the world, particularly the biological world. That
missing piece was provided less than a century later by the great biologist
Charles Darwin. His theory of evolution by natural selection is even now
accepted as the scientific explanation of why eyes and hands and hearts and
lungs do look like watches and swords, and yet are the product of natural
phenomena that do not in fact require intelligent design. Moreover, Darwin
combined his explanation of the appearance of design with the unanswered
question of the existence of suffering in the world, another much-debated topic.
As he explained in a famous letter: “But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as
others do, & as I shd [sic] wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all
sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade
myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the
Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living
bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I
see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed.”
Of course, Epictetus had not read Hume or Darwin, so I pointed out
especially the last passage to him, and he responded in quintessential Stoic

fashion. Remembering that one day one of his students who had a wounded leg
had complained about his injury—saying, “Am I then to have a maimed leg?”—
he told me that his response had been, shall we say, rather matter-of-fact: “Slave,
do you mean to arraign the universe for one wretched leg?” (Epictetus also often
called me “slave,” or “boy,” which, though somewhat politically incorrect, I find
both endearing and fundamentally unobjectionable: he himself was a slave, and I
am indeed significantly younger than him!)
Since this is an important aspect of Stoic metaphysics, it is worth examining
a bit more carefully. Although Epictetus was arguably the most religious Stoic
on record, he certainly didn’t think that God should concern Himself with every
minutia pertaining to human affairs (much less with Ichneumonid insects, had he
known about them), as is clear from his quip about the audaciousness of
someone pretending that the whole universe should be rearranged so that his leg
will not hurt. More importantly, many of the Stoics did not believe in anything
like the modern monotheistic conception of God. Their preferred word for it was
Logos, which can be interpreted as the Word of God (as the Christians who
inherited a lot of Stoic philosophy did), or as a kind of Providence embedded in
the very fabric of the universe, or even more simply as the rather straightforward
observation that the cosmos can be understood rationally, regardless of how it
came to be. Epictetus himself very clearly told his students that he did not think
God was something external, something “out there”: “You are a principal work,
a fragment of God Himself, you have in yourself a part of Him.… You bear God
about with you, poor wretch, and know it not. Do you think I speak of some
external god of silver or gold?” In this sense, the Stoics can be thought of as
pantheistic (or perhaps panentheistic)—that is, as believing that God is the
universe itself and therefore we all partake in the divine nature. The only
difference between human beings and other animals is that we are capable of the
highest attribute of God/Universe: reason. That is why the proper way to live our
lives is by using reason to tackle our problems.
This identification of God with Nature has a long history, and it was
developed particularly by the influential seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher
Baruch Spinoza. It is sometimes referred to as “Einstein’s God,” because a
similar sentiment was expressed by the famous physicist. There are two related
points to be noted about this conception of God: first, the divinity doesn’t engage
in miracles; this God does not suspend the laws of nature in order to intervene
here and there to right local wrongs. Second, and relatedly, there is very little
practical difference between this God and a simple acknowledgment (made by

the Stoics) that the universe works through a web of cause and effect; this very
modern concept is entirely compatible with the scientific view of the world as
we understand it. Thus, we can similarly interpret Epictetus’s somewhat flippant
answer to the student with the maimed leg in two ways: either to mean that God
concerns Himself with the workings of the universe as a whole, not of every
specific part, and that it is therefore presumptuous to complain about one’s own
issues; or to mean that the wound resulted from a series of causes and effects that
certainly did not have the student’s well-being in mind when they occurred, so it
is futile to remonstrate against the outcome. Either way, to ask for things to be
otherwise would indeed be to pretend to arraign the universe for the sake of one
wretched leg. Moreover, such a petition would of course be a flagrant violation
of the principle of the dichotomy of control, which we have seen is fundamental
to Epictetus’s teachings.
Epictetus replied to me that he was aware of the different opinions
concerning the gods, but insisted that he could make sense of only one of them:
Concerning the gods there are some who say that the Divine does not
exist, others that it exists but is inactive and indifferent and takes no
thought for anything, others again that God does exist and take thought
but only for great things and things in the heavens, but for nothing on
earth; and a fourth class say that God takes thought also for earthly and
human things, but only in a general way, and has no care for individuals:
and there is a fifth class, to whom belong Odysseus and Socrates, who
say: “where’er I move / Thou seest me.” For if there are no gods, how can
following the gods be the end of man? If again there are gods, but they
care for nothing, in that case too what good will it be to follow them?
As much as I admire the prose, here I reminded him that Stoicism does not
actually maintain that the end of man is to follow the gods. That was his own
version. What the Stoics, including Epictetus, said, as we have seen, is that we
should live our lives while following nature, and it is reasonable to equate this
with following the gods only once we have clarified the relationship between
nature and the gods—which Epictetus never really did. In fact, there was
disagreement on this point both among Stoics and between them and rival
schools, such as the Epicureans. The followers of Epicurus are often portrayed as
“atheists,” but they were nothing of the kind. They were what we today would
call deists, falling into the third group enumerated by Epictetus: according to

them, God does exist, but He is immersed in the contemplation of divine things,
paying no heed at all to earthly matters and human affairs. The world, for the
Epicureans, is made of a chaos of atoms randomly bumping into each other, and
while human beings are capable of using reason, their decisions and actions are
still held hostage, not to a divine providence, but to the effects of physical forces.
Some Stoics conceded this possibility, and others went so far as to
appropriate some of Epicurus’s thoughts and maintain—correctly—that
philosophy isn’t religion, it has no sacred texts, and it does not follow
unquestionable doctrines. On the contrary, as Seneca aptly put it, “That which is
true is mine,” meaning that a reasonable person makes truth her own, regardless
of whether it comes from friends or foes.
One of the Stoics who agreed with Epictetus’s general take on the divine, but
was more open-minded than him on such matters, was none other than the
emperor-philosopher Marcus Aurelius. It seems clear that Marcus believed in
gods. On the one hand, it is possible to rationalize some of his generic references
to them as not necessarily reflecting faith but rather a broad form of piety, as, for
instance, when he wrote: “To the gods I am indebted for having good
grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good
kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good.” On the other hand, however, he
was pretty explicit in other places: “Since it is possible that you might depart
from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go
away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the
gods will not involve you in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have
no concern about human affairs, why would I wish to live in a universe devoid
of gods or devoid of Providence? But in truth they do exist, and they do care for
human things, and they have put all the means in man’s power to enable him not
to fall into real evils.”
Then again, Marcus very explicitly says a surprisingly high number of times
in the Meditations that it doesn’t matter whether the universe is governed by a
providential divinity (in whatever form) or by random chaos (as the Epicureans
thought), thus showing himself to be less certain in questions of metaphysics
than Epictetus. Here is a taste of what I mean: “You have embarked, made the
voyage, and come to shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no want of
gods, not even there. But if to a state without sensation, you will cease to be held
by pains and pleasures.” Or consider this: “Either there is a fatal necessity and
invincible order, or a kind Providence, or a confusion without a purpose and
without a director. If then there is an invincible necessity, why do you resist? But

if there is a Providence that allows itself to be propitiated, make yourself worthy
of the help of the divinity. But if there is a confusion without a governor, be
content that in such a tempest you have yourself a certain ruling intelligence.” It
hardly gets more ecumenical than this!
Considering our discussion so far, you may have been wondering why—
given Epictetus’s insistent talk about God, contrasting so sharply with my own
skepticism—I have chosen him as a companion for this voyage of exploration of
Stoicism. Indeed, you might reasonably ask why someone who is nonreligious is
interested in Stoicism at all, given what can charitably be described as the
ambiguity of Stoics toward the divine. The answer goes to the heart of what I
think makes Stoicism such an attractive philosophy for the twenty-first century.
I used to be a brash atheist, even before New Atheism was a thing. When I
was living in Tennessee, secure in my conviction that creationists were little
more than country bumpkins waiting to be enlightened by the worldly professor
from Rome, I debated scores of people who believed the earth to be only a few
thousand years old. But I was seriously mistaken. Not about the age of the earth
—on that count, I’m pretty confident of my science trumping their religious
doctrine—but rather on the point of the whole exercise. The first time this struck
me was after a debate with Duane Gish, then the vice president of the Institute
for Creation Research (which, to be clear, does no such thing). I remember
feeling quite smug after having scored, or so I thought, a couple of really good
rhetorical blows against Gish that evening. But after the debate I was approached
by a number of people from his side who behaved very politely toward me and
said: “You know, I still don’t believe you are right and the Bible wrong, but I
appreciated tonight that you were nice and correct while debating Dr. Gish.” I
hadn’t made an impression on these folks by way of my astute science-based
arguments, but simply by showing up and behaving like a decent human being
rather than the prick they expected.
That point has been reiterated for me countless times now over the course of
several encounters with a number of believers, both Christians and those of other
persuasions. Moreover, I have learned that most of the time there is precious
little difference between my actual conduct and their own in the business of
everyday life. And if we are talking about mainstream religionists, as opposed to
fundamentalists, our opinions on most crucial matters of ethics and politics are
rarely that different—despite the fact that mine are allegedly informed by my
atheism and theirs by their faith. To put it in philosophical terms, it appears that
much of our diverging metaphysics makes little difference to what we think is

important in life, or to how we behave toward others. If that is the case, why
would I want to walk away from my believing interlocutors and join the New
Atheists over at their tent, where they are as exclusive in whom they welcome as
various groups of religious fundamentalists are about whom they admit to
church?
And what does this have to do with Stoicism? One of the things that attracted
me to it from the get-go is precisely what others may consider one of its
weaknesses: given the Stoic ambiguity over how to interpret the Logos, Stoics
can build a very large tent indeed, welcoming everyone from atheists to
agnostics, from pantheists and panentheists to theists, as long as none of these
guests impose their own metaphysical views on the others. Are you a Christian,
or Muslim, or practicing Jew? Fine, you can treat the Logos as a central attribute
of a personal God who created the universe. Does your metaphysical preference
lean more toward the idea that God is everywhere, to be identified with Nature
itself? Then you will feel at home with many of the original Stoics and their
conception of the rational principle of the universe. Are you instead an agnostic
or atheist? If so, the Logos represents the indisputable fact that the cosmos really
is organized rationally, even though we still do not know how such organization
came about, whether by design or as a result of brute cause and effect. If this
were not the case, then logic, mathematics, and science itself would go out the
window, and you do believe in them, right?
Mind you, this is no counsel for laziness of mind, or for a politically correct
and bland mix of otherwise incompatible positions. It is simply the realization
that what is important in life is to live it well, and that such an objective—the
eudaimonic existence sought by the ancients—depends very little on whether
there is a God or not, and if there is one, on what its specific attributes may or
may not be. Besides, as Cicero wisely put it: “There are many questions in
philosophy to which no satisfactory answer has yet been given. But the question
of the nature of the gods is the darkest and most difficult of all.… So various and
so contradictory are the opinions of the most learned men on this matter as to
persuade one of the truth of the saying that philosophy is the child of ignorance.”
This was true two millennia ago, and despite what you may have heard of late, it
is still true today. So why don’t we agree to disagree on this particular matter,
and get on together with the serious business of living a good life?

THE DISCIPLINE OF ACTION: HOW TO
BEHAVE IN THE WORLD

CHAPTER 7

IT’S ALL ABOUT CHARACTER (AND VIRTUE)

Of one thing beware, O man: see what is the price at which you sell your
will. If you do nothing else, do not sell your will cheap.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, I.2

THE OTHER NIGHT EPICTETUS RECOUNTED ONE OF HIS FAVORITE anecdotes, one he
regularly uses to make a broader philosophical point. The story concerns
Helvidius Priscus, a Roman statesman (and Stoic philosopher, as it turns out)
who had the unusual stamina—and luck, until it ran out—to live under several
emperors, from Nero to Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and finally Vespasian. According
to our friend and guide, “When Vespasian sent to him not to come into the
Senate he answered, ‘You can forbid me to be a senator; but as long as I am a
senator I must come in.’ ‘Come in then,’ he says, ‘and be silent.’ ‘Question me
not and I will be silent.’ ‘But I am bound to question you.’ ‘And I am bound to
say what seems right to me.’ ‘But, if you say it, I shall kill you.’ ‘When did I tell
you that I was immortal? You will do your part, and I mine. It is yours to kill,
mine to die without quailing: yours to banish, mine to go into exile without
groaning.’ What good, you ask, did Priscus do, being but one? What good does
the purple do to the garment? Just this, that being purple it gives distinction and
stands out as a fine example to the rest.”
Predictably, Vespasian acted on his threat, Priscus was banished from Rome
(for the second time in his life), and soon afterwards he was murdered on the
order of the emperor. The question rhetorically asked by Epictetus, “What good
did Priscus do, being but one?” is as obvious as it is difficult to answer. In the
case of the Roman senator, apparently no good came out of this encounter. He
was an ardent Republican who refused to recognize Vespasian as emperor, but
the Republican cause had by then been lost forever, and Priscus’s death caused
others to suffer: his wife Fannia commissioned Herennius Senecio (who was part

of the Stoic opposition to a later Flavian emperor, Domitian) to write a panegyric
in honor of her slain husband, as a result of which Senecio too was put to death.
And yet Epictetus had a point when he said that these episodes of human
courage and honor “give distinction and stand out as a fine example to the rest.”
That is why we are still in awe of individuals like Helvidius Priscus almost two
millennia after his self-sacrifice.
There are plenty of later and even contemporary stories that could be told by
a modern Epictetus to philosophy students; the names of their protagonists and
the details of what happened would be different, but these stories would provide
equally good examples of how human nature has not changed a bit since Roman
times, for better and for worse. One such example is Malala Yousafzai. Her story
is well known, but it is worth recalling. Malala was eleven years old when she
anonymously began writing a BBC blog detailing the harshly regressive
approach of the Taliban toward women’s education in the Swat Valley region of
Pakistan, where her family ran a chain of schools. Malala was then featured in a
New York Times documentary, which caused both her initial rise to fame and her
targeting by the Taliban. On October 9, 2012, a coward boarded her school bus,
asked for her by name, and shot her three times. Amazingly, Malala survived the
ordeal, eventually making a full recovery.
That experience alone would have been enough to put her on the same level
as Priscus and so many others over the centuries and across cultures who have
dared to stand up to repression and barbarism. But it turns out that the shooting
was just the beginning for Malala. Despite further threats by the Taliban against
her and her father Ziauddin, she has continued to argue publicly and vociferously
on behalf of young girls’ education, and her activism has been credited with
helping to pass Pakistan’s first Right to Education Bill. In 2014, at age
seventeen, she became the youngest person ever to receive a Nobel Prize, for
peace. I am confident that she will keep up the struggle throughout what I hope
will be a long and eudaimonic life. Did Malala make a difference? Yes, both in
practice (in that respect she was luckier than Priscus) and as a role model for
others—“a fine example to the rest” indeed.
But this chapter isn’t about role models (we’ll get there soon, since they do
play a very important part in Stoicism), but rather about the importance of
character and the related concept of virtue. Nowadays both words immediately
conjure up the sharp divide, especially in the United States, between the right
and left sides of the political spectrum. Conservatives tend to talk a lot about
both character and virtue, even when they do not actually practice the latter,

while liberals reflexively treat their valorization as thinly disguised tools of
oppression. Moreover, it is difficult, after two millennia of Christianity, not to
confuse the Christian meaning of “virtue” with the Greco-Roman one that
preceded and inspired it. Nonetheless, making that distinction is important and
will allow us to go back to conceptions of both character and virtue that
supersede political differences, I think, and that both conservatives and liberals
can live with—indeed, should live with if they really care about the values they
claim to care about.
Let’s begin by fleshing out the earlier introduction to the four Stoic cardinal
virtues and their relation to the modern, Christian-inspired versions. We will then
see empirical evidence that these virtues, or at least a very similar set of
desirable character traits—which is what virtues are—have been remarkably
consistent across a number of time periods and cultures. If nothing else, this
reinforces the idea that we are dealing with something truly important for
humanity as a cultured social species.
The Stoics derived their understanding of virtue from Socrates, who believed
that all virtues are actually different aspects of the same underlying feature:
wisdom. The reason why wisdom is the “chief good,” according to Socrates, is
rather simple: it is the only human ability that is good under every and all
circumstances. One can easily imagine other desirable things that are only good
under a certain set of circumstances and that can, or even should, be traded off if
the circumstances change. To be sure, being wealthy is better than being poor,
being healthy is better than being sick, and being educated is better than being
ignorant (standard pairs of preferred and dispreferred indifferents). But we also
need to know how to deal with all of them. In other words, we must have
wisdom—the ability to navigate well the diverse, complex, and often
contradictory circumstances of our lives.
The Stoics adopted Socrates’s classification of four aspects of virtue, which
they thought of as four tightly interlinked character traits: (practical) wisdom,
courage, temperance, and justice. Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions
that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical,
but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well
under challenging circumstances, as Priscus and Malala did. Temperance makes
it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to
excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of
how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human
beings with dignity and fairness.

One crucial feature of the Stoic (and Socratic) conception of virtue is that the
different virtues cannot be practiced independently: one cannot be both
intemperate and courageous, in the Stoic-Socratic meaning of the term. Although
it makes perfect sense for us to say that, for instance, an individual has shown
courage in battle and yet regularly drinks to excess or is ill-tempered, for the
Stoics that person would not be virtuous, because virtue is an all-or-nothing
package. I never said Stoic philosophy isn’t demanding.
What did the Christians do with the Socratic package of virtues? They took it
on board wholesale and expanded it. Thomas Aquinas, one of the most
influential Christian theologians of all time, developed the notion of “heavenly
virtues” in his Summa Theologiae, published in 1273. Basically, Aquinas kept
the four Stoic virtues and added three peculiarly Christian ones, originally
proposed by Paul of Tarsus: faith, hope, and charity. Aquinas’s system thus
featured four cardinal virtues and three so-called transcendent ones, and he
organized the resulting seven hierarchically: wisdom was the most important of
the cardinal virtues (as it was for Socrates), but all four are placed below the
transcendental virtues, among which charity sits on top.
Other cultures have developed, more or less independently, their own sets of
virtues as socially important character traits, each arriving at its own
classification of the relations among virtues. Interestingly, though, there is much
more convergence than we would expect in these days when cultural relativism
is so often portrayed as the norm. A study by Katherine Dahlsgaard, Christopher
Peterson, and Martin Seligman looked at how virtue is articulated in Buddhism,
Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, and what they call
“Athenian philosophy” (mostly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). They found a
rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religiousphilosophical traditions and identified a set of six “core” virtues:
Courage: Emotional strengths that involve the exercise of will to accomplish
goals in the face of opposition, external or internal; examples include
bravery, perseverance, and authenticity (honesty).
Justice: Civic strengths that underlie healthy community life; examples include
fairness, leadership, and citizenship or teamwork.
Humanity: Interpersonal strengths that involve “tending and befriending” others;
examples include love and kindness.
Temperance: Strengths that protect against excess; examples include
forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-control.

Wisdom: Cognitive strengths that entail the acquisition and use of knowledge;
examples include creativity, curiosity, judgment, and perspective (providing
counsel to others).
Transcendence: Strengths that forge connections to the larger universe and
thereby provide meaning; examples include gratitude, hope, and spirituality.
Four of the six are indistinguishable from the Stoic virtues. Stoics also
accepted the importance of “humanity” and “transcendence,” although they
didn’t think of these as virtues, but rather as attitudes toward others (humanity)
and toward the universe at large (transcendence). The Stoic version of humanity
is embedded in their concept of oikeiôsis and Hierocles’s contracting circles of
concern, which are at the center of the Cynic-Stoic concept of cosmopolitanism:
the idea that we ought to extend the sympathy we have for kin to our friends,
acquaintances, fellow countrymen, and beyond to humanity at large (and even,
some Stoics hinted, to the suffering of sentient animals).
As for transcendence, the Stoic Logos entails a sense of perspective about our
relationship with the cosmos and our place in it. Here is one of my favorite
examples, a meditation that Marcus Aurelius reminded himself to engage in
regularly: “The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that we
may be reminded of those bodies that continually do the same things and in the
same manner perform their work, and also be reminded of their purity and
nudity. For there is no veil over a star.” I love the poetry of that last sentence,
and I have been doing the early morning meditation from different parts of the
world during my travels, always finding it a soothing experience and a salutary
reminder of the large universe that we inhabit and often neglect to think of while
we go about our busy daily lives.
Returning to the virtues, the broader point here is not that Stoicism somehow
got it right while other traditions did not, but rather that human societies that
have developed philosophies of life have repeatedly come up with remarkably
similar lists of what we call virtues. I do not want to speculate on whether such
convergence is rooted in the earlier biological evolution of humanity, though it is
clear from studies in comparative primatology that we share with other species
of primates a number of prosocial behaviors that we tend to call “moral.”
Dahlsgaard and her colleagues also point out in passing that results similar to
their own have emerged from the few existing studies of virtues in nonliterate
societies—for instance, the Inughuit of northern Greenland and the Maasai of
western Kenya. Whether it is biology, culture, or, more likely, a combination of

both, the fact is that very disparate human societies, rooted in very distinct
religious-philosophical traditions, all seem to value the same core group of
character traits in their members, and these are the very same traits and attitudes
that Stoics have been teaching about for more than two millennia.
I mentioned earlier that how one reacts to the word “character” these days
has become a quick litmus test for whether one’s outlook is politically
conservative or liberal, with conservatives insisting that we should go back to
emphasizing character in schools, families, and the country at large, and liberals
rejecting such talk as a not-so-subtle attempt to maintain white male privilege,
patriarchy, and the like. This, I think, is highly unfortunate. Given evidence of
the universality of valuing character across human cultures, there is no reason
why the concept should have become associated with just one side of the
political spectrum in contemporary Western discourse. Epictetus and other
ancients saw character as both evolving throughout human psychological
development and fundamental to our personal identity: “‘Lay aside the senator’s
dress, and put on rags and appear in that character.’ Very well: is it not given me
still to display a noble voice? In what part then do you appear now?” Epictetus is
reminding us that whatever we don in the course of the day, the toga of a senator,
the suit of someone working on Wall Street, or the stereotypical tweed jacket
with elbow patches of a university professor, the true value of a person lies in
their core, and that core—our character—remains regardless of the role we
happen to play in society, whether by choice, happenstance, or necessity.
That is why it is crucial to social life not only to work to improve your own
character but to be able to assess the character of other people. There is a good
story in this regard concerning Diogenes the Cynic. One day (presumably before
he turned full-time philosopher, when he was still a banker, of all things), he was
asked for a letter of introduction. He told his interlocutor: “You are a man, and
that his eyes will tell him; but whether you are good or bad he will discover, if he
has skill to distinguish the good from the bad; and if he has not that skill, he will
never discover it, though I should write him ten thousand letters.” Epictetus
further clarified this point for my benefit: “A drachma might just as well ask to
be introduced to someone in order to be tested. If the man is a judge of silver,
you will introduce yourself. We ought, therefore, to have some faculty to guide
us in life, as the assayer has in dealing with silver, that I may be able to say as he
does, ‘Give me any drachma you please, and I will distinguish.’” In other words,
your character is your best calling card, and if you interact with good judges of
character, that’s all you’ll need.

I thought of this while watching the 2016 presidential primaries unfolding in
the United States, which happened to take place at about the same time as the
local elections in Italy, including that for mayor of Rome. The similarities
between the two countries’ elections were both striking and disheartening. What
seemed pretty obvious to me was that Diogenes would have found most (though
not necessarily all) of the major candidates—across the political spectrum and in
both countries—obviously deficient in character. Okay, maybe the standards of
the Cynics were impossibly high for most human beings, but still, the gulf
between the lofty ideal and the stark reality looked to me like a wide chasm, and
one far too ample for comfort considering that some of these people were
actually going to win the elections, and one of them was going to become the
president of the most powerful nation on earth.
To be fair, it is not easy to judge someone’s character if we have not met him
personally and have no history of repeated interactions. But when it comes to
highly visible public figures, modern media allow us to glean important clues
from what they say, how they say it, and especially how they act. By those
standards, I detected little in the way of courage or temperance, mostly vague
gestures toward justice, and remarkably little practical wisdom—arguably the
most important of the virtues—among these candidates.
Character takes on a predictable role in politics, with conservatives
emphasizing the character of their candidates at the expense of specific
programmatic platforms, while liberals do the exact reverse. But in politics as in
everyday life, there is no sharp separation between the two: I certainly want to
know the general ideas of a given presidential candidate, or mayoral candidate,
about crucial issues that he is likely to face should he win the election. What is
his take on climate change, foreign affairs, political and economic inequality,
individual rights, and so forth? But it is also obvious that once in office he will
have to deal with whatever complex political, economic, and social landscape
Fate thrusts upon him, and navigating that landscape successfully will require
more than some general ideas of where to go, as theoretically sound as they may
be. Indeed, what will be needed are exactly the fundamental virtues: the courage
to do the right thing under difficult circumstances, the temperance to rein in
excesses, a sense of justice in considering how people are going to be affected by
his decisions, and of course the practical wisdom that will allow him to negotiate
treacherous and always-changing waters.
Epictetus used an apt seafaring metaphor to make a related point:

For the helmsman to wreck his vessel, he does not need the same
resources, as he needs to save it: if he turn it but a little too far to the
wind, he is lost; yes, and if he do it not deliberately but from mere want of
attention, he is lost all the same. It is very much the same in life: if you
doze but a little, all that you have amassed up till now leaves you. Keep
awake then and watch your impressions: it is no trifle you have in
keeping, but self-respect, honor, constancy, a quiet mind, untouched by
distress, or fear, or agitation—in a word, freedom. What are you going to
sell all this for? Look and see what your purchase is worth.
Both public figures and every single one of us need to cultivate virtue and
character, but we also need to remain vigilant in order not to derail the ship we
command, be it an entire country or our own private lives, as even an apparently
inconsequential, momentary distraction can be disastrous. And above all, we
need to be cognizant of what our integrity is worth: if we decide to sell it, it
shouldn’t be for cheap. It is hard to read those words and not think about
political scandals and corruption, but perhaps the cleanup should start closer to
home, with our own behavior, our own too-often-unacknowledged propensity to
compromise principles for the sake of convenience, our lack of courage when it
is called for, our mostly theoretical sense of justice, our often flaunted
temperance, and our own manifestly very limited wisdom in managing whatever
life happens to throw at us.

CHAPTER 8

A VERY CRUCIAL WORD

For if one shows this, a man will retire from his error of himself; but as
long as you do not succeed in showing this, you need not wonder if he
persists in his error, for he acts because he has an impression that he is
right.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, II.26

NOT SO LONG AGO I WENT DOWN TO THE GHIONE, ONE OF the many small theaters
scattered throughout the quarters of old Rome. The show was a production of
Medea, the classic tragedy by Euripides, first performed in Athens at the
Dionysia festival in 431 BCE. Back then, the premiere didn’t go well, and
Euripides placed last in that year’s competition. But he certainly had the last
laugh. Unlike his rival Euphorion’s work, which won then but has since been
largely forgotten, Medea has been the most frequently staged Greek tragedy
throughout the last century.
The night I went, the wonderful Italian actress Barbara De Rossi was playing
the title role. Playing Medea is a very difficult undertaking because the actress
needs to somehow evoke a feeling of sympathy for a character who, after all,
kills her own children in revenge against her husband Jason (he of the
Argonauts), who has just left her for a local princess. By the end of the play, the
chorus is so shocked (and certainly so was the original public in Athens) that it
simply cannot make sense of what has just unfolded onstage:
Manifold are thy shapings, Providence!
Many a hopeless matter gods arrange.
What we expected never came to pass,
What we did not expect the gods brought to bear;
So have things gone, this whole experience through!

De Rossi pulled it off very nicely, but of course a lot of the credit goes to
Euripides’s brilliant study in the strong, intertwined human emotions of love and
hatred. You see, Medea had previously helped Jason steal the fabled Golden
Fleece from her native land, in the process betraying her father and killing her
brother. She did it for love and also to escape her “barbarian” country and come
to civilized Greece (remember, the play was written by a Greek). One of the
intriguing characteristics of the piece is that it can be (and has been) read either
as a tale of misogyny and xenophobia (Medea is a woman and a barbarian) or as
a proto-feminist story of a woman’s struggle in a patriarchal society.
The violent passions of Medea may seem to be very much at odds with the
alleged detachment advocated by the Stoics. Nevertheless, Epictetus relies on the
story to make some crucial points about human nature and the practice of
philosophy. It will take us a little bit to get back to Medea, so hang on tight.
As it happens, Epictetus encountered the same problem that I run up against
with my own students: they really want to study philosophy, but their parents tell
them that it isn’t practical, it’s a waste of time, and the like. Epictetus said: “This
is the defense that we must plead with parents who are angered at their children
studying philosophy: ‘Suppose I am in error, my father, and ignorant of what is
fitting and proper for me. If, then, this cannot be taught or learnt, why do you
reproach me? If it can be taught, teach me, and, if you cannot, let me learn from
those who say that they know. For what think you? That I fall into evil and fail to
do well because I wish to?’” I pointed out to him that such talk is well and good,
but it doesn’t really get to the heart of the matter, which is not just to claim that
learning philosophy will make you a better person, but to convincingly show that
it does.
So Epictetus continued: “What is the reason that we assent to a thing?
Because it seems to us that it is so. It is impossible that we shall assent to that
which seems not to be. Why? Because this is the nature of the mind—to agree to
what is true, and disagree with what is false, and withhold judgment on what is
doubtful.” Maybe, I replied, but an actual example would be more convincing to
me, and especially to my students’ parents. “Feel now, if you can, that it is night.
It is impossible. Put away the feeling that it is day. It is impossible.… When a
man assents, then, to what is false, know that he had no wish to assent to the
false: ‘for no soul is robbed of the truth with its own consent,’ as Plato says, but
the false seemed to him true.” Well, that’s intriguing, isn’t it? The point is that
nobody errs on purpose. Whatever we do, we think it is the right thing to do,
according to whatever criterion we have developed or adopted to establish right

action.
Much more recently, the philosopher Hannah Arendt made a similar point
with her controversial idea of the “banality of evil.” Arendt was sent by The New
Yorker to cover the trial of Adolf Eichmann, an SS-Obersturmbannführer
(lieutenant colonel) who had been one of the high-ranking Nazi officers in
charge of the logistics of Hitler’s so-called Final Solution for the Jewish people.
Arendt wrote a series of highly controversial articles for the magazine about the
trial, and these were eventually collected and published in her landmark book
Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil.
Part of the controversy hinged on the idea Arendt developed that “evil” is
often the result of lack of thought, meaning that people usually don’t want to do
evil, and certainly don’t think of themselves as evildoers. But they also tend to
follow the general opinion without critical analysis, and indeed—as in
Eichmann’s case—they are often convinced that they are doing a good job. The
Obersturmbannführer was proud of the efficiency with which he worked, never
mind that the work resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents
in Hungary, where his activities took place.
I found a tape of the last interview given by Arendt, who further clarified her
thinking about the banality of evil (some alternative translations of key German
words are in brackets):
During the war, Ernst Jünger came across some peasants, and a farmer
had taken in Russian prisoners of war straight from the camps, and
naturally they were completely starving—you know how Russian
prisoners of war were treated here. And [the farmer] says to Jünger, “Well,
they’re subhuman, just like cattle—look how they devour food like
cattle.” Jünger comments on this story, “It’s sometimes as if the German
people were being possessed by the Devil.” And he didn’t mean anything
“demonic” by that. You see, there’s something outrageously stupid [dumm
= ignorant, unwise] about this story. I mean the story is stupid, so to
speak. The man doesn’t see that this is just what starving people do, right?
And anyone would behave like that. But there’s something really
outrageous [empörend = shocking, revolting] about this stupidity.…
Eichmann was perfectly intelligent, but in this respect he had this sort of
stupidity [Dummheit = irrationality, senselessness]. It was this stupidity
that was so outrageous. And that was what I actually meant by banality.
There’s nothing deep about it [the ignorance]—nothing demonic! There’s

simply the reluctance ever to imagine what the other person is
experiencing, correct?
What both Arendt and Epictetus are getting at is a crucial Stoic concept, one
that originally derives from Socrates: people don’t do “evil” on purpose, they do
it out of “ignorance.” Whenever I say this, someone is guaranteed to get
outraged. What? Do I seriously mean to say that Hitler wasn’t evil? How could I
possibly be so naive? Or perhaps I harbor questionable sympathies? But as with
many terms in philosophy, “evil” and “ignorance” don’t mean quite what we
expect.
The term “evil” simply seems to invoke an unnecessary metaphysical
category. If what we are doing is simply labeling a particularly nasty type of bad
behavior, then there is little problem. But not infrequently, when we talk of evil,
we slide into a fallacy known as “reification” (literally, making a thing), which
means speaking of a concept as if it has some kind of mind-independent
existence, as if it is in some sense “out there.” Take the phrase “evil personified,”
as in “Hitler was evil personified,” meaning the embodiment, the physical
incarnation, of evil. But “evil” isn’t a thing characterized by independent
existence. It has no metaphysical consistency: it is simply a shorthand for the
really, really bad stuff that people do, or for the really, really bad character that
leads people to do said stuff. So, in an important philosophical sense, “evil”
doesn’t exist (but the really, really bad stuff does!).
Now let us tackle the more difficult concept—the idea that people do evil (in
this nonmetaphysical sense) out of “ignorance.” In the Euthydemus dialogue,
Plato has Socrates say, “Wisdom alone, is the good for man, ignorance the only
evil,” a phrase that has been misunderstood ever since. The word used by Plato
is amathia, which, to be precise, does not mean “ignorance,” as it turns out. The
philosopher Sherwood Belangia has written extensively on this topic, and it is
well worth considering his explanation of it.
Belangia begins with a conversation (from Plato’s dialogue Alcibiades
Major) between Socrates and his friend Alcibiades, an Athenian general and
politician with, shall we say, a more than checkered record, from an ethical point
of view:
SOCRATES: But if you are bewildered, is it not clear from what has gone
before that you are not only ignorant of the greatest things,

but while not knowing them you think that you do?
ALCIBIADES: I am afraid so.
SOCRATES: Alack then, Alcibiades, for the plight you are in! I shrink
indeed from giving it a name, but still, as we are alone, let me
speak out. You are wedded to stupidity, my fine friend, of the
vilest kind; you are impeached of this by your own words,
out of your own mouth; and this, it seems, is why you dash
into politics before you have been educated. And you are not
alone in this plight, but you share it with most of those who
manage our city’s affairs, except just a few, and perhaps your
guardian, Pericles.
The two Greek words for “ignorance” and “stupidity” are, respectively,
agnoia and amathia. Among Athenians, Alcibiades was one of the most
educated—in the normal sense of the word—and he was obviously intelligent,
again in the normal sense. So neither of the English words “ignorance” nor
“stupidity” really describe what Socrates is getting at. Instead, Alcibiades is
unwise: he “dashes into politics” without the proper “education,” meaning
without the sort of wisdom that comes from being virtuous. The contrast that
Socrates makes between his friend and Pericles is particularly illuminating:
Pericles was an Athenian orator famous for being not just educated and smart,
but also wise. That is what made him a good politician, and that is what—
tragically, as it turns out—was missing in Alcibiades. Amathia, then, can best be
thought of as lack of wisdom—the opposite of sophia, the word that gives root
to “philosophy.”
Belangia helpfully adds: “A-gnoia means literally ‘not-knowing’; a-mathia
means literally ‘not-learning.’ In addition to the type of amathia that is an
inability to learn, there is another form that is an unwillingness to learn.…
Robert Musil in an essay called On Stupidity, distinguished between two forms
of stupidity, one he called ‘an honorable kind’ due to a lack of natural ability and
another, much more sinister kind, that he called ‘intelligent stupidity.’”
Belangia also quotes philosopher Glenn Hughes, who provided a further
elucidation of the concept of amathia and connected it to Nazi Germany. To
Hughes, “intelligent stupidity” was not “so much lack of intelligence as failure
of intelligence, for the reason that it presumes to accomplishments to which it
has no right.” Intelligent stupidity “is no mental illness, yet it is most lethal; a

dangerous disease of the mind that endangers life itself.” The danger lies “not in
an inability to understand but in a refusal to understand, [and] any healing or
reversal of it will not occur through rational argumentation, through a greater
accumulation of data and knowledge, or through experiencing new and different
feelings.” Instead, intelligent stupidity is a “spiritual sickness,” and in need of a
spiritual cure.
So amathia seems to be a crucial word missing from the English vocabulary.
It is the opposite of wisdom, a kind of dis-knowledge of how to deal with other
human beings, and it results in awful actions undertaken by otherwise perfectly
functional, intelligent human beings. Moreover, people characterized by amathia
cannot simply be persuaded by reasoned argument, because they understand the
argument but are crucially deficient in their character, which, as the Stoics have
shown us, is developed over time by a combination of instincts, environmental
influences (especially family guidance), and reason. If something goes wrong
early on in a person’s development, it is difficult for reason alone to rectify the
resulting amathia later in life.
Which finally brings us back to Medea. Epictetus reminded me of what
Euripides has Medea say:
I know full well what ills I mean to do
But passion overpowers what counsel bids me.
Epictetus added: “Here the very gratification of passion and the vengeance
she takes on her husband she believes to be more to her profit than saving her
children.” Yes, I replied, but she is obviously deceived. “Why then are you
indignant with her, because, unhappy woman, she is deluded on the greatest
matters and is transformed from a human being into a serpent? Why do you not
rather pity her—if so it may be? As we pity the blind and the lame, so should we
pity those who are blinded and lamed in their most sovereign faculties. The man
who remembers this, I say, will be angry with no one, indignant with no one,
revile none, blame none, hate none, offend none.”
This is a stunning and profound insight into the human condition. It also
shows a degree of compassion that popular lore associates far more with, say,
Christianity than with Stoicism. And yet this is Epictetus, the slave-turnedteacher, who is speaking. Medea knew it was wrong to make her children suffer
to punish Jason, but emotion (vengeance), not reason, drove her to act as she did.
Epictetus advises pity, not indignation or anger, as our proper attitude toward

Medea because she is not “evil,” whatever that may mean, but a person lacking
something important, like a lame person (the same word Epictetus uses to
describe his own condition). Specifically, Medea lacks wisdom and is affected
by amathia, the sort of dis-knowledge that brings ordinary people to make
unreasonable judgments about certain situations that then lead them to what
outsiders correctly perceive as horrible acts. If we internalize this Stoic attitude
—or its equivalent in Buddhism or Christianity—we indeed will be angry or
indignant with no one; there will be no one we revile, blame, hate, or are
offended by. I submit that the resulting world would be significantly better than
the one we currently live in.
Epictetus elaborated on why he thought people like Medea are such tragic
figures:
Every error implies conflict; for since he who errs does not wish to go
wrong but to go right, plainly he is not doing what he wishes. For what
does the thief wish to do? What is to his interest. If then thieving is
against his interest, he is not doing what he wishes. But every rational
soul by nature dislikes conflict; and so, as long as a man does not
understand that he is in conflict, there is nothing to prevent him from
doing conflicting acts, but, whenever he understands, strong necessity
makes him abandon the conflict and avoid it.
That is, Medea did not wish to err, but was simply convinced that she was
doing the right thing. The same, I’m sure Epictetus would argue, was true for
Eichmann, despite the vast differences between him and Medea in
circumstances, apparent reasons for acting, and ultimate outcomes.
Modern psychologists have discovered a pertinent phenomenon known as
cognitive dissonance, a condition first described by the psychologist Leon
Festinger. Cognitive dissonance is a very uncomfortable psychological state that
occurs when someone becomes aware of the conflict between two judgments
that he holds to be equally true. People do not want to experience cognitive
dissonance, just as Epictetus said that people do not want to knowingly be in
error. Thus, they reduce dissonance by endorsing any explanation that deploys
what they think are good reasons leading to sound judgments, even though to
others those reasons and judgments appear to be obvious and even absurd
rationalizations. Aesop described this delightfully in his famous fable about the

fox and the grapes, back in the sixth century BCE.
The uncomfortable truth is, again, that people suffering from cognitive
dissonance are neither stupid nor ignorant. I have encountered plenty of smart
and well-educated individuals who nonetheless reject Darwin’s theory of
evolution, one of the most firmly established scientific theories ever. They have
to reject it, because it seems to them to be in irreconcilable conflict with the
Bible, the reference point for their whole lives as devout Christians. If we arrive
at the judgment that either Darwin is right or the word of God is true, then it is
perfectly natural—rational even—for some of us to choose God over Darwin.
Epictetus would not have been surprised, and neither should I have been when I
met fundamentalist creationists face to face for the first time. But I was much
younger (and somewhat less wise?) then. As the writer Michael Shermer has
observed, the more clever people are, the better they are at rationalizing away
the sources of their cognitive dissonance. Conspiracy theorists, for instance, are
often brilliant at explaining what others perceive as gaping holes in their theories
of how the world really works.
What’s to be done then? Once more, psychological research may be helpful
here. We know that the best way to help students change their conceptual
outlook about scientific notions is to purposefully increase their cognitive
dissonance until they feel so uncomfortable that they themselves seek out more
information and new sources to resolve the conflict. This, of course, is not
always possible—I doubt that it would have worked with Medea or Eichmann—
but the notion provides us with a good understanding of both what is going on
and what, if anything, can be done about it.
Still, I worry about the same sort of thing that critics of Hannah Arendt
worried about: isn’t the idea of evil being banal, of amathia, dangerously close
to an excuse for horrific behavior? Doesn’t it, at the very least, encourage us to
respond passively to “evil”? Naturally, Epictetus had pondered this as well:
“‘Such a one reviled you.’ Many thanks to him for not striking. ‘But he did
strike too.’ Many thanks to him for not wounding. ‘But he did wound.’ Many
thanks to him for not killing. For when, or in whose school, did he learn ‘that
man is a gentle and sociable creature and that wrongdoing in itself does great
harm to the wrongdoer’? If, then, he has not learnt this or been convinced of it,
why should he not follow what appears to be his interest?”
If this doesn’t sound to you like “turn the other cheek,” I don’t know what
does. But Epictetus didn’t stop at counseling endurance and patience, although
he certainly did that too: he actually diagnosed what is going amiss. The

wrongdoer does not understand that he is doing harm to himself first and
foremost, because he suffers from amathia, lack of knowledge of what is truly
good for himself. And what is good for him is the same thing that is good for all
human beings, according to the Stoics: applying reason to improve social living.
As far as the rest of us are concerned, remembering that people do bad things
out of lack of wisdom is not only a reminder to be compassionate toward others,
it also constantly tells us just how important it is to develop wisdom.

CHAPTER 9

THE ROLE OF ROLE MODELS

What would Heracles have been if he had said, “How am I to prevent a
big lion from appearing, or a big boar, or brutal men?” What care you, I
say? If a big boar appears, you will have a greater struggle to engage in; if
evil men appear, you will free the world from evil men.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, IV.10

ON OCTOBER 13, 1992, I WAS WATCHING THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL debate of the
American electoral season. I had moved to the United States from Rome a
couple of years earlier, and the whole idea of televised debates as “infotainment”
was very new to me. There were three men onstage: Al Gore and Dan Quayle,
two career politicians, and an awkward guy named James Stockdale. It was not a
good night for Stockdale, who began the debate with the amusing statement,
“Who am I? Why am I here?” People initially took his remarks as endearingly
self-deprecating, but then he quickly showed that he really had very little clue as
to what he was doing there. He seemed foolish, but little did I know that
Stockdale would become one of my role models, several decades after that night
and about ten years after his death. Stockdale, you see, was a modern Stoic, and
one whose story is well worth telling.
To do so, we have to go back to September 9, 1965. American involvement in
the Vietnam War had started in earnest the year before, after the bizarre
“incident” of the Tonkin Gulf: American warships fired at nothing in the middle
of the night, and President Lyndon Johnson used that as the official excuse to
begin “retaliatory” bombing raids on North Vietnam. Hearing the news,
Stockdale, who was commander of Fighter Squadron 51 of the US Navy and
who had actually been at Tonkin, commented, “Retaliation for what?” He was
ordered to keep silent.
On September 9, Stockdale was flying over North Vietnam when he was shot

down and captured. He would spend seven and a half years in the so-called
Hanoi Hilton, enduring an ordeal that included beatings and torture, as well as
being regularly locked up in leg irons and confined to a three-by-nine-foot cell
without windows. Despite these incredibly trying circumstances, Stockdale
managed to organize his fellow prisoners, creating and enforcing a code of
conduct to regulate their behavior. Moreover, in order not to be used for
propaganda by the North Vietnamese, he first slit his scalp with a razor, to
disfigure himself, and when that didn’t work he proceeded to bash his face with
a stool to make it swollen and himself useless to the enemy. At one point he even
slit his wrists to avoid being tortured and revealing the underground activities of
his comrades. Eventually Stockdale was released and came back to the United
States, in horrible physical condition. He began to recover, however, and in 1976
he was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military recognition, given for
acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty.
When he was asked in an interview who didn’t make it out of the Hanoi
Hilton, Stockdale replied:
Oh, that’s easy, the optimists. Oh, they were the ones who said, “We’re
going to be out by Christmas.” And Christmas would come, and
Christmas would go. Then they’d say, “We’re going to be out by Easter.”
And Easter would come, and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving,
and then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart.…
This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will
prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose—with the
discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality,
whatever they might be.
The interviewer referred to this as the Stockdale Paradox, but he might as
well have attributed it to the original source: Epictetus. Stockdale, back in 1959,
had been sent by the Navy to study at Stanford University in pursuit of a
master’s degree in international relations and—of all things—comparative
Marxist thought. Finding himself rather bored with his regular studies, he
wandered into the Philosophy Department. There he met Prof. Phil Rhinelander,
who changed Stockdale’s life profoundly. The Navy student enrolled in
Rhinelander’s two-term course, “The Problems of Good and Evil,” midway
through the first term. To make up for the delay, the professor offered Stockdale
one-on-one tutoring in his office, to catch up with the other students. In their last

session, Rhinelander picked up a copy of Epictetus’s Handbook and gave it to
Stockdale, saying: “As a military man, I think you’ll have special interest in this.
Frederick the Great never went on a campaign without a copy of this handbook
in his kit.” Stockdale eventually read both the Handbook and the Discourses
many times, and he later credited Epictetus with saving his life in Vietnam by
giving him the moral strength to overcome his ordeal, as well as the rational
lucidity to see what could and could not be done about it. It was a terrible
application of the Stoic dichotomy of control. In 1981 Stockdale became a
fellow of the Hoover Institution, based at Stanford, and for twelve years there he
wrote and lectured extensively about Stoicism.
Nothing of what you are about to read should be construed as either a defense
of the American intervention in Vietnam (which Stockdale knew was based on a
lie) or an attempt to demonize the North Vietnamese. It is only a personal human
story that we all ought to reflect on. Stockdale understood an important truth
about war that applies to life in general: holding the moral high ground and
maintaining self-respect is more important than the facts on the ground, be they
the weaponry on each side (in the case of war) or the circumstances of our
ordinary lives. Doing so involves a mind game, however, and that is why
Stoicism is so useful: it is a major mind game centered on keeping one’s moral
high ground and self-respect.
The first real test for Stockdale came when he was shot down on that
September 9. As he put it: “After ejection I had about 30 seconds to make my
last statement in freedom before I landed on the main street of that little village
right ahead. And so help me, I whispered to myself: ‘Five years down there at
the least. I’m leaving the world of technology and entering the world of
Epictetus.’”
As soon as he landed and was captured, Stockdale understood all too well
Epictetus’s dichotomy of control, specifically concerning his own stature in life.
In a matter of minutes, he went from being an admired officer, commanding 100
pilots and over 1,000 men, to “taking the ropes” and being vilified as a criminal.
After quickly freeing himself from his parachute, he was surrounded by a dozen
men: “By the time the tackling and pummeling and twisting and wrenching were
over, and it lasted for three or more minutes before the guy in the pith helmet got
there to blow his whistle, I had a very badly broken leg that I felt sure would be
with me for life. And that hunch turned out to be right.” He later recalled that
Epictetus too had been crippled for life after his leg was broken by his first
master, and that Epictetus’s assessment of that fact had been: “Lameness is an

impediment to the leg, but not to the will; and say this to yourself with regard to
everything that happens. For you will find it to be an impediment to something
else, but not truly to yourself.” Stockdale had seven and a half more years to
truly appreciate just how right the Greek philosopher was.
By the time he was brought into the Hanoi Hilton, Stockdale had resolved to
do precisely what Epictetus advised: to play whatever part Fate had allotted to
him to the best of his abilities. He constantly kept in mind that his enemies
would win only if he succumbed to two things: fear and loss of self-respect.
Stockdale studied his captors, and particularly the man who was in charge of
torturing him. As Epictetus and Arendt would both see, had they been there, he
came to understand that the man was not evil, but rather that he was doing his
job with what he perceived as integrity. Perhaps surprisingly, Stockdale
developed not hatred, but respect for him. A torturer’s job is to break the
prisoner’s spirit, to instill fear. Knowing this, Epictetus arrived at the only
possible response: “When a man who has set his will neither on dying nor upon
living at any cost, comes into the presence of the tyrant, what is there to prevent
him from being without fear? Nothing.”
Thanks to having internalized Epictetus’s philosophy, Stockdale was a man
on a mission, even in prison and with a broken leg. He created a secret society of
prisoners to whom, as the highest-ranking officer, he would do his best to issue
sensible orders to resist the enemy. He gave his soldiers practical advice as to
what was and was not permissible to admit under torture. Realizing that the US
government’s official policy of providing the enemy only with name, rank, serial
number, and date of birth would quickly get many of them killed, Stockdale
devised alternative guidelines of his own, which included not bowing in public
and not admitting to any crime—all designed to thwart the attempts of the North
Vietnamese to exploit prisoners for propaganda purposes. Sure enough, the
propaganda footage that was put out backfired, since many soldiers used their
appearances on film to engage in jokes at the expense of their captors. On one
occasion, Nels Tanner, a friend of Stockdale’s, answered a request for the names
of pilots who had turned in their wings to express opposition to the war by
providing two: Lieutenants Clark Kent and Ben Casey. Tanner endured the
consequences of his defiance: three successive days of rope torture followed by
123 days in leg stocks and isolation.
Eventually, the North Vietnamese understood the inner workings of the
resistance within the American group and sent Stockdale and nine others to
solitary confinement for periods ranging from three and a half to more than four

years. Another of Stockdale’s companions, Howie Rutledge, enrolled in a
master’s degree program when he finally made it back home and wrote a thesis
on whether torture or solitary confinement was more likely to break a person’s
spirit. To collect his research data he sent out questionnaires to his comrades and
to others who had been prisoners of war. The results were striking: those who
had spent less than two years in confinement said that torture was the worst;
those who had spent more than two years in isolation said that the latter
experience trumped even torture. That’s because, after going that long without
seeing anyone, a person desperately needs friends, quite regardless of who they
are, their ideologies, or their politics. Stockdale interpreted Rutledge’s finding in
the light of Epictetus’s teachings—that it is shame, not physical pain, that truly
brings down a human being. When he himself emerged from that experience, he
remembered that, asked what was going to be the fruit of all his teachings,
Epictetus replied: “Tranquillity, fearlessness, and freedom.” That certainly came
true for James Stockdale.
One important question is whether it was truly Stoicism that made Stockdale
invulnerable to torture and solitary confinement, or whether Stoicism was simply
an after-the-fact rationalization of feats that resulted from his innate character. A
more philosophical way to put this is: can virtue be taught, or are people born
with whatever virtue they have? Not only did the ancient Greeks debate this
issue in detail, but modern biology and developmental psychology have
uncovered a significant amount of empirical evidence that is very relevant to it.
In Plato’s Meno, Socrates is asked by the character bearing that name: “Can
you tell me, Socrates, is human excellence something teachable? Or, if not
teachable, is it something to be acquired by training? Or, if it cannot be acquired
either by training or by teaching, does it accrue to me at birth or in some other
way?” After a lengthy discussion, Socrates concludes that “excellence” (or
virtue) may be teachable in principle, but as there are no teachers of it to be
found anywhere, in practice it is not. The implication, then, is that people who
have it probably acquire a propensity for it as an endowment at birth. Aristotle,
however, had different ideas. He made a crucial distinction between moral virtue
and intellectual virtue, the former arising from both natural disposition and habit
acquired while growing up and the latter resulting from reflection in a mature
mind. It follows, then, that there are three sources of virtue: some comes from
our natural endowment, some is obtained by habit, especially early in life, and
some can be acquired intellectually and therefore can be taught.
This “mixed” model of the acquisition of virtue happens to work well with

Stoic philosophy and is also favored by modern research in cognitive
psychology. The Stoics, as we have seen, held a developmental model of
morality, thinking that we naturally come equipped with the ability to have
regard not just for ourselves but also for our caretakers and other people with
whom we come into regular contact early on in life. Once the age of reason
arrives, however, when we are about seven or eight years old, we can begin to
further build our virtuous character by two means: habit and (more so later in
life) explicit philosophical reflection.
In modern psychology, perhaps the most famous attempt to summarize how
people develop morally is Lawrence Kohlberg’s theory of six stages of moral
development, which builds on Jean Piaget’s original work, as well as on a
significant amount of modern empirical evidence. The six stages described by
Kohlberg are grouped into three phases: pre-conventional morality (which
begins with a stage regulated by obedience and punishment and then moves to a
stage of self-orientation), conventional morality (from a stage of interpersonal
accord and conformity to one of maintenance of social order and response to
authority), and post-conventional morality (from a stage of response to a
perceived social contract to one of adherence to universal ethical principles).
Kohlberg’s theory has been criticized on a number of levels, including too much
emphasis on rational decision-making and on the ethical concept of justice (as
opposed to, respectively, the role of instinctual judgments and of other ethical
virtues, such as care for others). But it does seem to hold fairly well across
cultures, even though people go through the different stages at different rates,
and distinct cultures emphasize some aspects of the model more than others.
Regardless, we do not have to buy into a specific modern theory of moralpsychological development to agree with the general idea that we get our ethics
from a combination of instincts, training, and—for those so inclined—explicit
critical reflection. This theory is in accord with repeated findings by biologists
who study gene-environment interactions in a variety of living organisms:
complex traits, especially behavioral ones, seem almost always to develop
through a continuous feedback of genes and environments, nature intermingled
with nurture. And of course, for human beings a major aspect of the environment
is our culture and our social interactions with other members of our species.
Which is all we need to get back to Stoicism.
Role models such as James Stockdale, Paconius Agrippinus, Helvidius
Priscus, and Malala Yousafzai highlight the point that Stoicism is a practical
philosophy, not abstract theorizing. While Stoics of course put forth ethical

principles for how to conduct ourselves and live the eudaimonic life, their
emphasis was on how real people behave, not just how they talk. Observing and
imitating role models, then, is one powerful way to work on our own virtue. We
do something like this in modern societies as well, whenever we hold up public
figures as examples to our younger generations. The problem nowadays is that,
by and large, we do a pretty bad job of picking role models. We glorify actors,
singers, athletes, and generic “celebrities,” only to be disappointed when—
predictably—it turns out that their excellence at reciting, singing, playing
basketball, or racking up Facebook likes and Twitter followers has pretty much
nothing to do with their moral fiber.
A similar problem arises with the contemporary, highly inflated use of the
word “hero,” especially in the United States. Some brave people who are willing
to sacrifice themselves for the common good truly deserve that appellative
(though they don’t have to be almost exclusively drawn from the ranks of the
military or the police). But someone who dies, say, as a result of a terrorist attack
is not a hero—he is a victim. He probably did not display courage and otherregard; he just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. We should
most certainly mourn him, but labeling him a “hero” does not do justice to what
actually happened, and it does a great injustice to actual heroes, confusing
people about the very meaning of the term.
The other thing to remember about role models—and the Stoics understood
this very well—is that they are not perfect human beings, for the simple reason
that there is no such thing. Moreover, making perfection an integral part of our
concept of role model means that we are setting a standard that is impossibly
high. Some religions do this of course. For Christians, the model of universally
good behavior is Jesus, but that’s a tough role model to actually attempt to
emulate, since believers are literally trying to be like gods. Bound to fail, we
have to accept the divinity’s mercy as our path to salvation.
The Stoics, eminently practical and good connoisseurs of human psychology
that they were, approached things differently. Seneca wrote an essay on the
nature of the wise person, the ideal Stoic role model, or Sage. Here is how he
responded to his critics who thought that he was setting the bar too high for
anyone to actually succeed at being wise: “You have no cause for saying, as you
are wont [sic] to do, that this wise man of ours is nowhere to be found; we do not
invent him as an unreal glory of the human race, or conceive a mighty shadow of
an untruth, but we have displayed and will display him just as we sketch him,
though he may perhaps be uncommon, and only one appears at long intervals;

for what is great and transcends the common ordinary type is not often
produced; but this very Marcus Cato himself, the mention of whom started this
discussion, was a man who I fancy even surpassed our model.”
Marcus Cato, known as Cato the Younger, was a Roman senator and a
political opponent of Julius Caesar. Cato was a Roman aristocrat, and as such a
product of his time. He was unable to see, for instance, that the Roman Republic
he so idolized was highly unequal (though not as much as it would become
under the empire he fought to prevent) and founded on slavery and military
conquest. For instance, in 72 BCE, he volunteered to fight against the rebel slave
Spartacus, clearly not having paused to consider that the revolt might have been
a reaction to extreme injustice. Like most Romans, he was probably also not
particularly bothered by the clearly inferior position accorded to women in that
society. In other words, he would spectacularly fail a modern test as a role
model. But that would be exactly the wrong way to look at him, because it
would be an attempt to make him a godlike figure capable of doing what no
human being can do: completely transcend his own upbringing. Instead, we
should assess him by the standards of his own culture and time. By those
standards, he was a role model indeed.
Cato was an unusual kid. At fourteen, he asked his tutor Sarpedon why
nobody acted to stop the illegal actions of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, to
which Sarpedon replied that people feared Sulla more than they hated him. Cato
then said, “Give me a sword, that I might free my country from slavery.”
Sarpedon never again let Cato play unattended when in Rome, just in case. After
he began to study Stoicism, Cato lived very modestly, despite the wealth he
inherited. When he was given a military command in Macedon at age twentyeight, he marched with his men, sharing their food and sleeping quarters. As a
result, he was loved by his legionnaires. Later on, in his political career, Cato
quickly built a reputation for incorruptibility—a very unusual trait at that, or any,
time. As quaestor, he prosecuted Sulla’s informers for illegal appropriation of
treasury funds and for murder. When he was sent to Cyprus, he managed the
public books with absolute integrity (again, a rare thing indeed), raising 7,000
silver talents for the Republic’s treasury. To appreciate the enormity of that sum,
consider that a Roman talent weighed 32.3 kilograms (71 pounds) and that a
single, smaller, Attic talent was sufficient to pay nine man-years of skilled work
—or equivalently, a month’s wages for a trireme ship’s crew of 200.
Eventually, Cato came into open conflict with Julius Caesar, who followed in
the steps of Sulla and declared war against the Roman Senate by crossing the

river Rubicon with one of his legions, the occasion on which he famously
declared, “Alea iacta est” (The die is cast). The rest, as they say, is history:
Caesar’s forces, after an initial setback, defeated the Senate’s army at Pharsalus,
in Greece. Cato refused to concede and retreated to Utica, in modern Tunisia.
Caesar pursued Cato and his allies and won a final decisive battle at Thapsus.
Cato, refusing to be captured alive by his enemy, who would have used him for
political gain, did the Roman thing: he attempted to commit suicide with his
dagger. Plutarch tells us the rest of the story:
Cato did not immediately die of the wound; but struggling, fell off the
bed, and throwing down a little mathematical table that stood by, made
such a noise that the servants, hearing it, cried out. And immediately his
son and all his friends came into the chamber, where, seeing him lie
weltering in his own blood, great part of his bowels out of his body, but
himself still alive and able to look at them, they all stood in horror. The
physician went to him, and would have put in his bowels, which were not
pierced, and sewed up the wound; but Cato, recovering himself, and
understanding the intention, thrust away the physician, plucked out his
own bowels, and tearing open the wound, immediately expired.
Caesar was not pleased, commenting: “Cato, I grudge you your death, as you
would have grudged me the preservation of your life.” You can appreciate why
Seneca thinks of this sort of man as a true Stoic role model.
After all this talk of overcoming the hardships of torture and solitary
confinement, or of disemboweling oneself in order not to concede political
advantage, you might have the impression that Stoicism is not impossible, but it
sure is demanding. As the public philosopher, and my colleague, Nigel
Warburton asked me during an interview, “What about ordinary life, where
people hardly have to face such extreme situations or display such levels of
courage and endurance?”
It’s a good question, but the answer is simple enough: it is by hearing about
great deeds that we not only become inspired by what human beings at their best
can do, but also are implicitly reminded of just how much easier most of our
lives actually are. That being the case, it shouldn’t really take a lot of courage to
stand up to your boss when your coworker is being treated badly, no? I mean, the
worst that can happen is that you’ll be fired, not put into solitary confinement
and tortured. How difficult is it, really, to behave honestly in the course of

everyday life, since we are not risking military defeat and the prospect of suicide
to save our honor? And yet, imagine how much better the world would be if we
all did display just a bit more courage, a slightly more acute sense of justice,
more temperance, and more wisdom each day. The Stoic gamble was that
hearing about people like Cato, Stockdale, and the others we have encountered
here helps us put things into perspective—that is, to become slightly better
human beings than we already are.

CHAPTER 10

DISABILITY AND MENTAL ILLNESS

Doing without a wheelchair is not a basic life goal.
—LAWRENCE BECKER, VIDEO ADDRESS TO POST-POLIO HEALTH INTERNATIONAL

STOICISM IS MEANT TO AID ACTUAL PEOPLE IN LIVING THEIR lives to the fullest
possible extent. But it is another question whether Stoicism can also be helpful
to those who are forced to live, not simply through challenging circumstances,
but through permanently challenged lives—people who are confined to a
wheelchair, for instance, or battling a debilitating mental illness. The answer
appears to be a qualified yes, at least some of the time. Philosophy is no miracle
cure, and it should not be treated as one.
In this chapter, we will take momentary leave of our friend Epictetus and
meet three modern Stoics who have stories to tell about how their philosophy
helped them cope with the aftermath of polio, with depression, and with autism.
We have seen that the ancients often taught by invoking real and imaginary role
models, from Socrates to the demigod Heracles. The people we will encounter in
this chapter are modern Stoic role models whose thoughts and actions give us
much to reflect upon and be inspired by in our own little and big quotidian
struggles.
Larry Becker, now a retired professor of philosophy who taught at the
College of William and Mary, wrote a fundamental academic book on modern
Stoicism. I initially became aware of Larry because of that book, which
eventually I spent several months discussing with my friend Greg Lopez and a
number of others interested in Stoicism in New York City. Larry’s book is not
easy to read without some background in philosophy, and the style is, shall we
say, unusual. From the beginning, he refers to the Stoics as “us” and “we.” Here
was someone who evidently took the idea of Stoicism as a personal philosophy
very seriously.

It soon turned out that I had no clue as to just how seriously! By chance I
discovered that my friend and colleague Nick Pappas at the City College of New
York, who is an ancient philosophy scholar (meaning a scholar of ancient
philosophy, not that he’s particularly old), is a good friend and former colleague
of Larry’s, and so the two of us were introduced.
Larry has been suffering for decades from the aftermath of polio. Nick had
told me about heroic feats performed by his friend to overcome the effects of his
disability and flourish in his teaching and scholarly career, and this background
had of course already put his book and interest in Stoicism into a whole different
perspective for me. Then Larry made me aware of a video he had done for PostPolio Health International, of which he was president and chair from 2006 to
2009. It was watching that video that made me fully appreciate why Larry
Becker is a modern role model in the best Stoic tradition.
Larry had polio in his teenage years, back in 1952, prior to the vaccine, and
spent a lengthy time in a rehabilitation hospital. Initially he was quadriplegic and
confined to an iron lung. After two and a half years of rehabilitation, he had
regained the use of his legs, but not of his arms. Larry’s breathing was
compromised by polio, a condition that has gotten worse with age. Because he
cannot use his diaphragm, he breathes with his neck muscles; when he goes to
sleep, he stops breathing entirely until his blood CO2 climbs enough to wake him
up. As he wryly put it, “That’s inconvenient.” So he uses a small portable
ventilator for sleeping and for resting during the day. The physical abilities he
recovered in the rehabilitation hospital years ago are gradually disappearing as
he ages, and it is now impossible for him to teach other than in a one-on-one
situation.
In the video, Larry begins by explaining that early on he was able to leave his
wheelchair and walk up and down stairs to get to and from his teaching
classroom. But things began to get worse in the early 1980s, and he started
dreading the idea of going to class or attending faculty meetings (well, all right,
everybody dreads faculty meetings). His initial reaction was to say nothing to
others and to simply avoid having to walk or climb stairs as much as possible.
But he quickly got to the point where he had a hard time dealing with just the
four steps he had to negotiate between his office and the open campus. He was
spending idle time at his desk, worrying about getting outside, and then about
going home in the evening.
His initial analysis was that he was suffering from a phobia, perhaps
accompanied by something like panic attacks. So he went to see a psychiatrist

who specialized in rehabilitation. The psychiatrist himself was totally blind,
which must have made it no cakewalk for him to get through medical school.
The psychiatrist’s office was in a nice old house, with five uneven steps from the
parking lot, four more to the front porch, and no handrails. Not good.
After an initial explanation from Larry, the psychiatrist asked him what was
bothering him right at that moment, to which Larry replied, somewhat testily,
“I’m bothered by how I’m going to get out of your building.” The psychiatrist
calmly picked up his phone, called his secretary, and asked her whether they had
a ramp running around the back of the building, down to the parking lot. She
confirmed that they did. “How do you feel now?” inquired the psychiatrist.
“I feel fine about that,” Larry said.
The doctor then went through a series of potential practical solutions to the
problem: Can you change office? No. Can the university build you a ramp?
Possibly. The doctor told Larry that he had taken subways to get to medical
school, and that as a blind man he was terrified of subway platforms. “It’s a
reasonable fear,” he added, “and you’ll notice that I chose to practice in a city
without subways.” At that point Larry began to feel a bit foolish. The university
did build a ramp for him, and he got a wheelchair with foot controls. That was a
good lesson in practical Stoicism, without the theory.
Larry reflected that these sorts of things had happened to him throughout his
life and, moreover, that they happen to everyone, disabled or not. This reflection
led him to a number of suggestions to help others develop a personal philosophy
about life, whether they live with a disability or not.
Larry’s first point is to realize the importance of agency. It has been crucial
for him to feel like an agent in the world, not a patient. Some big tasks, however,
must be accomplished—for instance, becoming and remaining an agent in the
first place. At the beginning of our lives as helpless infants—“entry-level human
beings” he calls them—we are “patients,” entirely dependent on others. We
slowly learn, from scratch, how to be agents. We become adults, taking charge of
our lives, claiming and earning our agency (all of which is perfectly compatible
with the Stoic doctrine of ethical development, with which we are by now
familiar). For Larry, the most devastating disabilities are precisely those that
severely limit or entirely erase our agency. Yet he claims that even if polio
paralyzes you completely, paralysis itself doesn’t permanently rob you of your
agency. Nevertheless, you may need to reclaim it, slowly and painfully, as he
did. Indeed, he saw the whole question of dealing with his disability as
coinciding with his need to reclaim his agency.

After you have reclaimed your agency, Larry points out, you are in the same
position as everyone else: you have to become good at being an agent. This, he
says, requires lining up the following elements: values, preferences, goals,
deliberations, decisions, and actions. If these are incoherent, incomplete, or
weak, then you are paralyzed no matter what your physical condition happens to
be. You can also be paralyzed by indecision, because you are not committed to a
particular course of action and wish to keep multiple possibilities open. Facing
too many choices on the menu, or too many cars on the dealer’s lot, isn’t a good
thing, as modern cognitive science clearly shows. To complicate things, there is
the fact that the world itself changes, requiring constant adjustments to our goals,
decisions, and actions. In other words, we need to learn how to maintain agency
under changing circumstances. Like airline pilots, we need to keep learning new
skills, but unlike airline pilots, we don’t have the luxury of learning with
simulators. Life only happens once, and we learn “in the air,” not in a safe
environment. To make things even more stressful, we usually have passengers
we care a lot about on board too!
Second, we need to focus on abilities, not disabilities. Larry has learned to
disregard his disability, or at least to regard it as a dispreferred indifferent. This
requires mastering additional tasks, like keeping the focus incessantly on
abilities. The emphasis, for every human being, should be on what we can do,
not on what we cannot do. Instead of saying, “I can’t do that,” say, “I can do it
this way.”
We also need to practice the Socratic task: know thyself. Knowing our
physical and psychological abilities includes knowing our limits. Ignorance, or
worse, self-deception about our own abilities can be very dangerous. We need to
keep an up-to-date, accurate account of what is possible for us. This will depend
not just on our abilities but also on the specific (and variable) physical and social
environments in which we find ourselves at different times. Larry also counsels
us to train ourselves to recognize when we have lost a good fit between our
abilities and our activities. We must develop what he calls an internal alarm
system, which will tell us when it’s time to stop suffering and begin (or resume)
taking charge. Larry knows from experience that knowing oneself is hard, it
takes practice, and it requires some perspective.
Third, we need to develop a life plan. To do this we must take a look at our
entire life, make plans, and arrive at decisions “all things considered,” as
philosophers say. The idea isn’t the naive one of figuring out what we want to do
in life early on and then just implementing the plan, Soviet-style. Rather, Larry

suggests making a habit of reflecting on what is important to us and on the best
way to achieve it, and also to continuously revise our life plan, according to our
changing abilities and circumstances. Our dynamic plan should be coherent,
ambitious, achievable, revisable, and—ideally—compatible with a generally
rising level of life satisfaction. In his own case, Larry admits that, by failing to
keep things in perspective in the late 1980s, he denied the onset of the late
effects of polio; with a better perspective, he would have told himself that maybe
his fear of long staircases was not that unreasonable after all.
Fourth, we should strive for internal harmony, which is a matter of constantly
attempting to harmonize the components of our (dynamic) life plan. We need to
harmonize our spiritual and rational experiences, our desires and our needs, our
reason with our actions. “Personally, I think to have a harmonious life is
preferable to being an interesting subject for a biographer, a journalist, or a
gossiper,” Larry wisely observed.
Lastly, Larry cautions us to beware of brick walls. We need to recognize them
when we hit them; even better is to see them coming before we hit them hard.
The trick here, according to Larry, is to know when to quit: neither a minute too
soon nor a minute too late. Avoiding brick walls requires not only that we keep
learning about our abilities throughout life, but also that we determine that what
looks like a brick wall really is one. “If it is an illusion, then you can go through
it; if it is not, then you need to work around it, or go in another direction
entirely.” The problem, he adds, is that we seem to have trouble figuring out
which brick walls are worth worrying about and which ones we should try to tear
down. The way Larry deals with this problem is by going back to the basics.
First he identifies his fundamental life goals and commitments: to his wife of
forty-six years and to the goals of their life together; to his professional
objectives; and to the creation of a truly physically and socially hospitable
environment for everyone. Only when these commitments are at stake is he
willing to stop if he encounters an actual brick wall, and only if he hits it pretty
hard. Ramps, in Larry’s estimation, don’t qualify: “Doing without a wheelchair
is not a basic life goal.”
It is hard for me to add something meaningful here. I am truly in awe of a
decent human being who is a serious scholar, a committed Stoic, and someone
who has clearly lived his philosophy under very challenging circumstances. I’ll
try to remember Larry the next time I think I’ve hit a brick wall that much more
likely is just an illusion conjured by my self-centered imagination. As Epictetus
famously put it: “Bear and forbear.”

Our second example of a modern Stoic who has used his philosophy to
manage a difficult situation is Andrew Overby and his fight against depression.
Unlike the case of Larry, I have not met Andrew, at least not yet. Our
acquaintance, which I’m not positive is reciprocal, is through blogs and social
networks. Of course the reader should keep in mind that in all these cases I am
definitely not speaking from personal experience: Fate has, so far, been kind
enough to not involve me in anything as serious as what we are talking about.
Nonetheless, the great thing about human beings is that we can communicate our
thoughts and emotions to others, not just in person but through the power of the
written word. Although we will never know exactly what it is like to be another
person, we can certainly gain enough understanding to empathize.
Andrew describes what, from his vantage point, Stoicism can do under his
circumstances. Again, this description isn’t coming from someone like me, who
has never experienced depression and could only give theoretical advice to
others who find themselves in truly difficult circumstances. Rather, Andrew’s
case illustrates practical philosophy at its best—through the testimony of a
human being who discovered firsthand what is and is not helpful to him in
solving his problem. Just as we have seen with Larry, Andrew most certainly
does not claim that Stoicism can somehow magically cure depression.
Nevertheless, he did find something helpful in the practice of Stoicism.
To begin with, he says that one of the crucial things for people affected by
depression is to constantly monitor themselves and their mental condition. If
there is anything that Stoicism trains people to do it is to monitor their own
reactions and reflect critically on how they perceive and interpret the world.
When Andrew wrote about his encounter with Stoicism, he was a young man
of twenty-four suffering from a depression that stemmed in part from the gulf he
had gradually realized existed between his expectations about his life and the
world, on the one hand, and his life and the world as they were, on the other
hand. It seemed like reassessment and perhaps an attempt at partial detachment
were in order. Andrew began to read about Stoicism because he had heard that it
is similar in many ways to Buddhism, and also because during a visit to the
Clinton Library in Arkansas he had discovered that President Clinton held
Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic emperor-philosopher, in high regard. (I will leave to
others a discussion of whether Bill Clinton behaved anything like a Stoic during
his life and career.) Andrew was intrigued. Moreover, one goal of Stoic
philosophy, especially in its Roman period, was to achieve tranquillity—
something that is good for any human being, but especially for someone

suffering from depression. The Stoics attempted to do so by cultivating positive
emotions and monitoring and rejecting negative ones. (We will take a closer look
at these techniques in due time.) Andrew was also attracted by the Stoic spirit of
communality with the rest of humanity, its rejection of attachment to the sort of
external goods that characterize our hyper-consumerist society, and its emphasis
on duty toward others and equanimity in the face of adversity.
Through Stoicism, Andrew learned to turn depression into an asset of sorts.
As he explains: “Depressed people are rather self-aware; in fact, they are too
self-aware, and too negatively so, often deriding themselves for small infractions
of their own idealized standards, putting themselves down for not being perfect
even in a world they recognize as being full of imperfections and human capital
squandered. Part of depression is fixating on failures in the past, ruminating
continually on past events or circumstances, and even drawing a kind of negative
confidence from them. This type of thinking is antithetical to good outcomes at
the present time, at least the vast majority of the time. It causes failure in the
present, building a feedback loop whose hunger cannot be easily filled. One
failure builds atop another, and now another.”
Once Andrew realized this connection between negative thinking and
depression, his mind turned immediately to Epictetus’s dichotomy of control.
Things under our control include our decisions and behaviors; things not under
our control include the circumstances we find ourselves in, as well as other
people’s thoughts and actions. Of course, it’s not like someone is depressed,
reads lines in the Discourses or the Handbook that seem to speak to his situation,
and then voilà!—everything is hunky-dory. But Andrew kept reading and
reflecting. Indeed, the Stoics taught that it is with mindful repetition that we
change our own behaviors and even our internal feelings—something confirmed
by a number of modern psychotherapies that are effective for the treatment of
depression and other conditions.
Another aspect of Stoicism that Andrew found particularly helpful was the
philosophy’s emphasis on using adversity as a training ground for life. Marcus
Aurelius perhaps expressed the idea most forcefully, in the very same
Meditations so admired by Bill Clinton: “The art of life is more like the
wrestler’s art than the dancer’s, in respect of this, that it should stand ready and
firm to meet onsets that are sudden and unexpected.” In a sort of life judo, the
Stoic faces up to adversity by treating life itself as a wrestler in the training ring,
as an opponent who is not (necessarily) out to beat us, but whose purpose is to
keep us on our toes; the Stoic becomes eager to face his opponent because that’s

the way toward self-improvement. As the modern Stoic Bill Irvine puts it: “One
of the most interesting developments in my practice of Stoicism has been my
transformation from someone who dreaded insults into an insult connoisseur. For
one thing, I have become a collector of insults: On being insulted, I analyze and
categorize the insult. For another thing, I look forward to being insulted
inasmuch as it affords me the opportunity to perfect my ‘insult game.’ I know
this sounds strange, but one consequence of the practice of Stoicism is that one
seeks opportunities to put Stoic techniques to work.” Strange, yes, but I can
attest to the same liberating and empowering feeling, and so can Andrew.
His testimony emphasizes two other aspects of Stoic practice that are
particularly helpful to a depressed person, one of them in a somewhat
counterintuitive fashion. The first is Epictetus’s insistence that we look at
“impressions,” that is, at our first reactions to what the world presents us with,
and realize that in many cases they are not what they seem. Think of Irvine’s
“insult game”: what someone says to us is his opinion, which may or may not be
grounded in fact. Whether we perceive someone else’s remark as an insult or not
is entirely up to us, quite regardless of the intention of our interlocutor. Someone
may call me fat, as indeed happened somewhat frequently when I was a young
boy. Well, is it true? At one time in my life it was. In which case, why get
offended? What does it even mean to feel insulted by a fact? Conversely, is it not
true? Then the fellow who hurled the insult is both childish in his behavior and
factually wrong. How is that going to injure me? If anything, he is the one who
loses in the confrontation. Here is how our Epictetus put it to me, as a friendly
challenge: “Stand by a stone and slander it: what effect will you produce? If a
man then listens like a stone, what advantage has the slanderer?… ‘I have done
you an outrage.’ May it turn out to your good.”
The second aspect of Stoic practice that—perhaps surprisingly—Andrew
found very helpful was what modern Stoics call negative visualization. The basic
idea, again adopted by modern cognitive behavioral therapy and similar
approaches, is to regularly focus on potentially bad scenarios, repeating to
yourself that they are not in fact as bad as they may seem, because you have the
inner resources to deal with them. The negative visualization exercise, what the
ancient Romans called premeditatio malorum (literally, foreseeing bad stuff),
may focus on something as mundane as the irritation you feel when someone
cuts you off in traffic or on events as critical as the death of a loved one, or even
your own.
Now, why would anyone, let alone someone who is depressed, want to

imagine the worst on purpose? Well, for one thing there is the empirical
observation that it actually works: visualizing negative happenings decreases our
fear of them and mentally prepares us to deal with the crisis when and if it
ensues. But there is a flip side to visualizing the negative: we gain a renewed
sense of gratitude and appreciation for all the times when bad things do not
happen to us, when we leisurely drive down the road on a beautiful day or enjoy
the presence of our loved ones because they are very much alive and well.
I don’t even know the name of my third fellow Stoic, as the essay I read by
her or him was published anonymously. And I certainly cannot relate to what she
(I will assume she’s a woman for the sake of simplicity) is going through, having
been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ten years before writing her
article. That was accompanied by depression at the realization that her dream of
an academic career was not to be—not because of external obstacles to
becoming and finding a job as a historian, as formidable as those can be, but
because of her inner obstacles: she simply couldn’t cope with the social
environment of the modern academy. Indeed, her life was dominated by fear of
failure and lack of self-confidence, which eventually landed her in a psychiatric
hospital. When she was released, she rediscovered Stoicism. She had read about
it as a youngster, in a popular book of philosophy for teens, Jostein Gaarder’s
Sophie’s World. Now she Googled “cognitive behavioral therapy,” seeking
practical help, and found the website of a practitioner who traced the roots of the
approach to Buddhism and Stoicism.
She began to read, and eventually she discovered that the Stoic to whom she
responded the most was the Roman playwright and orator Seneca. (I have
observed this fascinating, if anecdotal, thing about modern Stoics: depending,
presumably, on personality, we tend to have a favorite ancient and to be drawn to
his particular way of interpreting the philosophy. My favorite Stoic, obviously, is
Epictetus.) Seneca wrote about self-knowledge and suggested that sometimes we
are the worst obstacles to our own improvement: we see where we should go,
which is where we want to go, and yet somehow we can’t pick ourselves up and
begin the journey. This observation obviously resonated with our anonymous
author: “The problem with some people in the spectrum is knowing what is good
for oneself. Some people with autism reportedly struggle with finding a sense of
purpose for most of their lives.”
A second aspect of Stoic philosophy that spoke to our autistic author was
Seneca’s insistence on the social dimension of human existence. In a famous
passage, he says: “Our relations with one another are like a stone arch, which

would collapse if the stones did not mutually support each other, and which is
upheld in this very way.” Relating to others in a socially useful fashion is still the
author’s biggest challenge, but at least she now has her goals much more clearly
in mind, goals that are being guided by her understanding of Stoicism. And as
Seneca keeps telling her every time she turns to him: “I do not know whether I
shall make progress; but I should prefer to lack success rather than to lack faith.”
The three cases we have briefly examined here have something fundamental
in common: for Larry, just as for Andrew and the anonymous writer, Stoicism
triggered a change in perspective, a profound alteration in how they looked at
their lives. Importantly, this is precisely what the philosophy is meant to do: all
the major Stoic authors insist that it is crucial that we reflect on our condition
and truly make an effort to see things in a different light, one that is both more
rational and more compassionate. And no, those two requirements are most
definitely not at odds with each other, certainly not from a Stoic point of view.
Such a change in perspective helps people to cope better with their situation.
Stoicism is predictably often accused of promoting passive acceptance of things
—despite the fact that the Stoics we know of were most definitely men and
women of action, bent on changing the world for the better to the extent that it
was in their power to do so. Regardless, coping is an essential human skill that is
obviously helpful not just to people confined to wheelchairs, those battling
depression, or those affected by autism. Coping skills are useful to all of us,
since we will always encounter tough situations in life with which we must come
to terms.
Finally, the combination of seeing, and therefore understanding, things
differently and the empowerment that derives from the ability to cope sometimes
opens up new ways of dealing with our problems that perhaps we had not
thought of before—as when the psychiatrist pointed out to Larry (who felt a bit
foolish) a couple of obvious solutions to his problem, one of which turned out to
be eminently practical. Stoicism is no silver bullet. But any philosophy that can
do these things, even under the very challenging conditions we have encountered
in this chapter, certainly deserves our attention and perhaps a shot at being
practiced.

PART III
THE DISCIPLINE OF ASSENT: HOW TO
REACT TO SITUATIONS

CHAPTER 11

ON DEATH AND SUICIDE

I must die, must I? If at once, then I am dying: if soon, I dine now, as it is
time for dinner, and afterwards when the time comes I will die.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, I.1

THE ANCIENT STOICS WERE VERY CONCERNED WITH DEATH. Actually, “concerned” is
precisely the wrong word. They were aware of death and of the importance that
human beings attach to it, but they developed a very unusual and empowering
view of it.
I must confess that I’ve had long and hard conversations with Epictetus about
this topic: the thought of death used to bother me deeply. Indeed, there was a
time in my life when I was thinking about it almost every day, and on some days
more than once. I don’t want you to get the impression that I was ever the
brooding type, prone to depressive thoughts. On the contrary, I’ve always been
reasonably optimistic about life, enjoying or doing my best with whatever
Fortune sends my way (and she has sent a lot, thankfully). Moreover, I am a
biologist. I know that death is a natural occurrence, the result of the particular
evolutionary pathway taken by our ancestors eons ago. (If we were bacteria, for
instance, we wouldn’t die of old age, only of accidents; then again, we wouldn’t
be able to develop philosophies of life either.) Still, the thought of my
consciousness one day ceasing to exist did upset me. Things started to change
when I first read Epictetus’s statement at the beginning of this chapter. I laughed
out loud and thought, What an unbelievably lighthearted attitude toward what
most people think is the most dreadful thing of all.
Epictetus also explained to me why I was so bothered: “Why does an as of
wheat grow? Is it not that it may ripen in the sun? And if it is ripened is it not
that it may be reaped, for it is not a thing apart? If it had feelings then, ought it to
pray never to be reaped at any time? But this is a curse upon wheat—to pray that

it should never be reaped. In like manner know that you are cursing men when
you pray for them not to die: it is like a prayer not to be ripened, not to be
reaped. But we men, being creatures whose fate it is to be reaped, are also made
aware of this very fact, that we are destined for reaping, and so we are angry; for
we do not know who we are, nor have we studied human things as those who are
skilled in horses study the concerns of horses.”
This is an intriguing passage. Epictetus sets forth three interlinked ideas. To
begin with, we are no different from other living beings: like the wheat whose as
are destined to ripen in the sun, we too are destined for “reaping.” The Stoics
took destiny more literally than many of us do today, since they believed in some
sort of cosmic Providence. But even from a thoroughly modern scientific point
of view, we can see that we are one of millions of living species on one of what
are probably billions of habitable planets in the universe.
The second point Epictetus makes is crucial: we are so distraught about the
prospect of our own death precisely because, unlike wheat and most other
species on earth presumably, we are capable of contemplating that thought. And
yet, knowing something does not change the nature of the thing of course—it
just changes our attitude about it. This line of thought thus leads straight back to
the fundamental Stoic idea of the dichotomy of control: death itself is not under
our control (it will happen one way or another), but how we think about death
most definitely is under our control. That’s the part we can and need to work on.
This second point leads to the third one: the analogy between studying human
affairs and—of all things—studying horses. Epictetus is reminding us that if we
are afraid of death, then it is out of ignorance: if we knew or truly understood
more about the human condition—as a horse trainer knows and understands
horses—then we wouldn’t react the way we do to the prospect of our own death.
All of the above notwithstanding, Epictetus sensed that I wasn’t quite
convinced, so he changed tactics, as any good teacher does when faced with a
promising student who nevertheless just refuses to see an important point: “Will
you realize once for all that it is not death that is the source of all man’s evils,
and of a mean and cowardly spirit, but rather the fear of death? Against this fear
then I would have you discipline yourself; to this let all your reasonings, your
lectures, and your trainings be directed; and then you will know that only so do
men achieve their freedom.” This is an idea also taken up by other Stoics, like
Seneca, and by later figures influenced by Stoicism, such as Montaigne: if there
is one thing that philosophy ought to be good for, it is to make us better
understand the human condition by showing us not only how to live to our best

but to accept the fact that death is nothing to be afraid of. Even the Stoics’
archrivals, the Epicureans, thoroughly agreed. As the founder of their school
wrote in his “Letter to Menoeceus”: “Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is
nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is
come, we are not.”
What, then, if I fall ill? I asked Epictetus, thinking that perhaps it isn’t death
but the process of dying that is the real issue. “You shall bear illness well.” Of
course, but who shall tend me? “God, and your friends.” But I shall lie on a hard
bed. “But you can do it like a man.” I shall not have a proper house. “If you have
one, you will be ill all the same.” Tough teacher, isn’t he? But by now all of this
makes perfect sense from within the Stoic framework, right? It is a fact of life
that we are stricken by illnesses, and for most of us one of them will eventually
kill us. And we ought to consider ourselves lucky if we do have friends or loved
ones nearby—it will mean that we have been decent-enough people to maintain
such ties with the rest of humanity. Those around us cannot cure our illness or
save us from death, but they can accompany us part of the way, comforting us
before we get there. And of course it would be better to end our journey in a
proper house and on a soft bed, but, really, compared to what will be happening
and should be absorbing our full attention, those are minor details.
So, inevitably, the time will come to die, I continued. “What do you mean by
‘die’?” Epictetus corrected me. “Do not use fine words, but state the facts as they
are. Now is the time for your material part to be restored to the elements of
which it was composed. What is there dreadful in that? What loss to the universe
will this mean, what strange or irrational event?” Again, the reassuring voice of
calm reason. Again, the invitation to take a broader perspective on things rather
than be focused on one’s own self. The astronomer Carl Sagan, one of my
scientific role models when I was a kid, invited us to reflect on the fact that we
literally are stardust: the chemical elements of which we are made originated
after the explosion of a supernova somewhere in the neighborhood of the solar
system, and billions of years of evolution later such matter became the very
molecules that constitute our bodies. It is a wonderful, awe-inspiring thought.
But the converse of that is what Epictetus is getting at: we will, again literally,
return to dust, recycling our chemicals, allowing new living beings to take our
place in the workings of the universe. It doesn’t matter whether those workings
have a point or whether they are just what they are: either way, we came from
cosmic dust and we will return to cosmic dust. If anything, this should make us
even more appreciative of the infinitesimal interval, from a cosmic perspective,

during which we are alive and we eat, drink, and love. Regret at the anticipation
that this interval will end is not just irrational but entirely unhelpful.
And yet, some people are not persuaded of this at all. On the contrary, a
number of techno-optimists think that death is a disease that should be cured,
and they are investing good money in the effort. Broadly speaking, they call
themselves “Transhumanists,” and quite a few of them can be found among the
white male millionaires in Silicon Valley, where many of the world’s most
influential tech companies are located. Perhaps the most famous and influential
of the bunch is Ray Kurzweil, a futurist (someone who thinks he can study and
predict the future) currently working at Google to develop a software capable of
understanding natural language.
Kurzweil has a number of important achievements under his belt, including
the development of the first omni-font optical character recognition system. Age
sixty-eight at the time of this writing, he has been arguing for some time that the
way to immortality will be to upload our consciousness into a computer, which
he claims will be possible any day now. Indeed, we better manage that feat
before the so-called Singularity, a term invented by the mathematician Stanisław
Ulam to describe the moment when computers will outsmart people and begin to
drive technological progress independently—and perhaps even in spite—of
humanity itself.
This is not the place to explain why I think the whole idea of a Singularity is
predicated on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of intelligence, or
why “uploading” our consciousness to a computer is extremely unlikely to ever
be possible, since consciousness is neither a thing nor a piece of software. Here
I’m more interested in the chutzpah displayed by people like Kurzweil as well as
by his almost cultlike following, who think of themselves as so important that
they ought to, godlike, transcend the laws of nature itself, never mind the fact
that they are spending inordinate amounts of money and energy that could be
directed toward ameliorating actual, urgent problems the world faces right now,
or the disastrous ethical and environmental consequences of their success (if it
were possible). Who, exactly, would have access to the new technology, and at
what price? If we succeed in becoming physically immortal—the alternative to
uploading hoped for by some Transhumanists—will we keep having children? If
so, how would an already diseased planet sustain the thirst for natural resources
of a population that grows so relentlessly and manage its ever-escalating
production of waste products? Ah, but we will expand beyond Earth! We shall
colonize other worlds! Never mind that we still don’t know of any other

habitable worlds in the galaxy, or that we have no clue about how to get to them,
if they’re out there. The more I think about Transhumanism the more the word
hubris, famously invented by the Greeks precisely for such thinking, seems
awfully appropriate.
The likes of Kurzweil simply don’t want to leave the party, it seems to me, no
matter what the cost, and regardless of how privileged they have been while
attending it. Which is why I imagine him having this conversation with
Epictetus: “No, I wanted to go on feasting.” “Yes, those at the Mysteries too
want to go on with the ceremony, and those at Olympia to see fresh competitors,
but the festival is at an end. Leave it and depart, in a thankful and modest spirit;
make room for others. Others must come into being, even as you did, and being
born must have room and dwellings and necessaries. But if the first comers do
not retire, what is left for them? Why will nothing satisfy or content you? Why
do you crowd the world’s room?” Which brings me to the second, far more
delicate, topic of this chapter, and one to which the Stoics devoted a lot of
thought that I think is very much of relevance to us moderns: suicide.

ON THE WEEKEND OF JULY 23 AND 24, 2016, THE PERFORMANCE artist Betsy Davis

hosted a party with thirty or so of her closest friends and family. The occasion
was joyous, with people playing cello and harmonica, drinking cocktails and
eating pizza, and watching one of Betsy’s favorite movies, The Dance of Reality.
A bit before sunset on Sunday the guests left, and Betsy watched the sunset on
her wraparound porch. Shortly after, in the presence of her caretaker, her doctor,
her massage therapist, and her sister, Betsy took a cocktail of morphine,
pentobarbital, and chloral hydrate prescribed by her doctor and died peacefully.
You see, Betsy was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, also
known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. She had almost completely lost control of her
muscles; at forty-one, she not only was unable to perform but could no longer
brush her teeth or scratch an itch, let alone stand. Her speech was slurred and
had to be translated to others. She took the dignified way out, thanks to the
recently enacted California law on assisted suicide. Hers was a beautiful, heartwrenching story, which I related to Epictetus. “If it is not to your profit, the door
stands open: if it is to your profit, bear it. For in every event the door must stand
open and then we have no trouble,” he calmly replied. The “open door” was the
standard phrase he used with his students whenever he wanted to talk about
suicide. Seeing my puzzlement, he elaborated: “Suppose someone made the

room smoke. If the smoke is moderate I will stay: if excessive, I go out: for one
must remember and hold fast to this, that the door is open. The order comes, ‘Do
not dwell in Nicopolis.’ I will not. ‘Nor in Athens.’ I give up Athens. ‘Nor in
Rome.’ I give up Rome. ‘Dwell in Gyara.’ I dwell in Gyara: but this seems to me
a very smoky room indeed, and I depart where no one shall hinder me from
dwelling: for that dwelling is open to every man.”
Before we examine this more closely, allow me to insert an interesting
historical parenthesis about Gyara, apparently the place where Epictetus thought
one might have a hard enough time standing to actually consider walking
through “the open door.” Gyara is a small Greek island in the Cyclades to which
the ancient Romans exiled troublemakers. One such troublemaker was none
other than Musonius Rufus, Epictetus’s teacher, who was sent there by the
emperor Nero for allegedly participating in the Pisonian conspiracy—a charge
unlikely to have been true. (That was the second time Musonius was sent into
exile.) The practice of sending exiles to the island, which is apparently pretty
arid, was later resurrected by the military junta that controlled Greece from 1967
to 1974. This time it was leftist intellectuals who played the part of the Stoics;
about 22,000 of them were sent there. However bad the conditions are on Gyara,
it must be said that Musonius may have been tougher than even Epictetus, since
he didn’t choose the open door, but rather waited on the island until he was
recalled to Rome.
Getting back to Epictetus, there are a number of important things to notice in
the passage just quoted. To begin with, he very clearly states that deciding
whether or not to walk through the “door” is a matter of personal judgment,
pertinent to specific situations. If the situation is truly unbearable for you, then
you have the option to leave. Second, and crucially, the door must stand open
and then we will have no trouble: what will make it possible for us to withstand
harsh conditions and very difficult periods in our lives will be precisely that we
always have an alternative course of action at our disposal. Just as, for the
Stoics, death itself is what gives urgent meaning to life, the possibility of leaving
life voluntarily gives us the courage to do what is right under otherwise
unbearable circumstances. Finally, notice the reference to the coming of an
“order” to leave. Scholars of Epictetus have shown that he is talking about God
here, but in a very subtle way, which is once again compatible with either a
religious or a secular reading.
Recall that Epictetus, more so than other Stoics, believed in Providence, that
is, in a general plan for the cosmos. That plan, however, was not laid out by a

personal God who answers prayers or is concerned with the fate of individuals.
Epictetus explained the idea to me using yet another analogy: “For the foot (for
instance), I shall say it is natural to be clean, but if you take it as a foot and not
as a detached thing, it will be fitting for it to walk in the mud and tread upon
thorns and sometimes to be cut off for the sake of the whole body: or else it will
cease to be a foot. We must hold exactly the same sort of view about ourselves.”
That explains the sense in which someone might receive a “call” to cut himself
off the rest of the (cosmic) body, so to speak. But how are we to know about the
call? How do we interpret the will of the universe? We make use of reason. It is
therefore entirely up to us, individually, to examine the situation and decide
whether we hear the call of the cosmos—so to speak—or not. It is, in other
words, our own judgment that tells us whether it is time to walk through the
open door or whether we should stay and fight another day.
Being practical philosophers, the Stoics fine-tuned their ability to make such
judgments by reflecting on examples from the past, just as the story of Betsy
Davis had me reflecting on disease and mortality. The very first mention of a
Stoic committing suicide concerns Zeno of Cyprus, the founder of Stoicism.
Diogenes Laertius, in his Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, tells a number of
different stories about how Zeno died (only one of which can be true, obviously).
One says that, being old, frail, and in pain, he decided that he had nothing more
to contribute to society, so he starved himself to death. This may or may not have
happened, but the story is significant because it introduces the idea that it is
acceptable for Stoics to walk through the open door under certain circumstances,
given that it is possible that the very founder of the school did it.
There are several more examples from Stoic lore, but I’ll mention just two of
them in order to broaden our view of the topic. We have already encountered
Cato the Younger, who literally tore his guts out so as not to fall into the hands
of Julius Caesar. The last example is Seneca, a rather controversial figure even
within Stoic circles. It is not at all clear just how much Seneca lived up to his
own philosophy, given his involvement with Nero’s regime. He has been
portrayed as everything from a hypocritical schemer to a secular saint, with the
truth likely being somewhere in the middle: he was a flawed man (as he himself
repeatedly wrote) who tried his best under nearly impossible circumstances.
Seneca succeeded in guiding Nero and containing the damage for the first five
years of his reign, even if he eventually lost control of the increasingly unhinged
emperor. Regardless, as mentioned earlier, he was suspected of being part of the
Pisonian conspiracy that sent Musonius into exile, also probably on trumped-up

charges. Nero ordered Seneca to commit suicide, which he did, at age sixty-nine.
He could have resisted (probably in vain), tried to escape, or pleaded for his life,
as many others did. Instead, he chose a dignified exit, in part to retain his
integrity, and in part to preserve at least some of the family assets so that
surviving relatives could inherit them.
I’ve brought up the examples of Zeno, Cato, and Seneca, with all the due
historical caveats, because they illustrate five different reasons for walking
through the open door. Zeno did so because he was in increasingly unbearable
pain, and he also felt that he had become useless to society—not very different
from the case of Betsy Davis. Cato walked through the open door for principled
reasons in defense of a political cause. Seneca did so as a matter of personal
dignity and to safeguard the people he was leaving behind. (To this list one can
add the attempted suicide of James Stockdale.) Some of these reasons for
committing suicide are being debated today in military, moral, and medical
circles, so that the Stoics still have very much to contribute to our evolving view
of the world. We certainly regard as heroes those people who sacrifice their lives
for the greater good, and an increasing number of countries are allowing, or at
least considering, forms of assisted suicide like the one made possible by
California lawmakers to aid people who feel, as seemed to be the case with Zeno
twenty-three centuries ago, that they are at the end of their life. Of course, these
notions are controversial, as political suicide can be as virtuous as Cato’s (or
Stockdale’s, had he succeeded), but also as horrible as that of modern-day
suicide bombers. And ending our lives on our own terms is seen as empowering
by some but as a sacrilege against the sanctity of life by others.
Then there is the danger that someone may commit suicide for no good
reason. A Stoic rationale should never be deployed, for instance, in the case of
people who are mentally ill and require aid in recovering, not in ending, their
life. Similarly, there are trivial excuses to commit suicide that would most
certainly not receive the approval of a Stoic. For instance, after the publication
of Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774, there were a number of
copycat suicides among young men who fancied themselves to be real-life
versions of the story’s protagonist. This led to the banning of the book in several
places. In 1974 the sociologist David Phillips coined the term “Werther effect” to
refer to the general phenomenon of so-called suicide contagion, often inspired by
the suicide of celebrities, fictional or otherwise.
Epictetus, ever the wise man, was aware of this danger, and made it clear to
me that a light attitude toward taking one’s own life was not the Stoic way: “Let

me describe another state of mind to be found in those who hear these precepts
amiss. A friend of mine, for instance, determined for no reason to starve himself.
I learnt of it when he was in the third day of his fasting, and went and asked him
what had happened. ‘I have decided,’ said he. Yes, but, for all that, say what it
was that persuaded you; for if your decision was right, here we are at your side
ready to help you to leave this life, but, if your decision was against reason, then
change your mind. ‘A man must abide by his decisions.’ What are you doing,
man? Not all decisions, but right decisions.” Epictetus added: “Stay where you
are, and depart not without reason.”

CHAPTER 12

HOW TO DEAL WITH ANGER, ANXIETY, AND LONELINESS

Wherever I go, there is the sun, there is the moon, there are the stars,
dreams, auguries, conversation with the gods.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, III.22

PHILOSOPHERS ARE OFTEN CARICATURED AS ALOOF, FOREVER engaged in navelgazing of no interest to the rest of us. Or worse: they may simply be intellectual
frauds, pretending to think deep thoughts while in fact they are peddling either
nonsense or trivialities disguised by incomprehensible language. Already in 423
BCE, the great Greek playwright Aristophanes made fun of Socrates in The
Clouds, depicting him as a sophist (not a compliment, neither then nor ever
since), though apparently the then-forty-five-year-old sage took it in stride: it is
reported that when some foreigners who were attending the play asked, “Who is
this Socrates?” he cheerfully stood up in order to be identified by the crowd in
the theater.
Perhaps in reaction to this intellectual excess, real or perceived as it may have
been, the Hellenistic (immediately post-Socratic) philosophies all tended to
emphasize pragmatism—and none more so, arguably, than Stoicism. Little is
more pragmatic than learning to manage anger, anxiety, and loneliness, three
major plagues of modern life. Of course, once again, this isn’t your standard
self-help book promising silver bullets: we are going to deal with these issues
calmly, reasonably, and with realistic expectations, just as a proper Stoic would
do.
This is an attitude that, of course, I learned from our friend during one of our
conversations, when he told me:
Yesterday I had an iron lamp beside my household gods, and hearing a
noise I rushed to the window. I found the lamp had been carried off. I

reasoned with myself, that the man who took it yielded to some plausible
feeling. What do I conclude? Tomorrow, I say, you will find one of
earthenware. I lost my lamp, because in the matter of vigilance the thief
was a stronger man than I. But he bought his lamp for this price: for a
lamp he became a thief, for a lamp he broke his faith, for a lamp he
became a brute.
As usual, there is a lot packed into what Epictetus is saying, and it took some
mulling over his words before I fully appreciated his take. First off, notice that
he is not distraught or angry, but matter-of-fact; moreover, he immediately
reaches a couple of pragmatic conclusions: that what he lost was easily
replaceable (tomorrow I will find another lamp), and that if he wishes to avoid
another theft, perhaps he should opt for a cheaper but equally effective item (a
lamp of earthenware, rather than iron), because it just isn’t worthwhile trying to
beat a thief at the vigilance game. Then comes the analysis of the deeper
meaning of the incident: Epictetus acknowledges that the thief must have yielded
to some plausible feeling—he must have reckoned that what he was doing was
worth the price. But our sage disagrees with the judgment of the thief, whose
conclusion he finds highly questionable: he gained an iron lamp, but in the
transaction he lost something much more precious—his integrity.
I had an unfortunate opportunity to test Epictetus’s teachings while I was
writing this book. I had just boarded the A-line subway train in Rome with my
companion; we were on our way to meet my brother and his wife for a leisurely
evening. While entering the train car, I felt an unusually strong resistance from a
guy nearby, who was forcefully pushing back despite the fact that there was
ample room for both of us in the car, which was crowded but not unbearably so.
When I finally realized—a few seconds later—what was actually going on, it
was too late: while I was being distracted by the unyielding fellow, his friend
lifted my wallet from the left front pocket of my trousers and swiftly exited the
subway car just before the doors closed. The thief had indeed beaten me at the
vigilance game, and kudos to him for his dexterity. My first impression, as the
Stoics would say, was one of surprise and frustration at having been fooled. But
my mind again quickly went back to Epictetus, and I steadfastly refused to grant
assent to that impression. Okay, I had lost my wallet, some cash, and a few credit
cards that needed to be blocked. Oh, and my driver’s license, which had to be
replaced. With good modern electronic technologies, taking care of all that took
only a few keystrokes on my smart phone (which was still in my other front

pocket!) and a few days’ wait. But the thief had lost his integrity in the bargain.
Before my practice of Stoicism, an experience like this would probably have
made me angry and resentful for the rest of the evening, which would not have
done any of us any good (nor would that response have affected the thief or
brought back my wallet). Instead, it took only a few minutes to mentally process
what had taken place, and by the time we met my brother and his wife all was
good with my mind, which had returned to a more tranquil state, and we were
able to enjoy a nice evening at the movies.
Neither Epictetus’s story about the lamp nor my subway incident should be
interpreted as counseling a fatalistic or defeatist attitude. Rather, both suggest
that we step back and analyze a situation more rationally, always keeping in
mind the dichotomy of control between what is and is not in our power. It is not
in our power to make thievery disappear from the world, but it is in our power to
engage in a battle of attention with thieves, if we think that’s worth our efforts
and time. It is not in our power to change the robber’s judgment that forgoing his
integrity in exchange for a lamp or a wallet is a good bargain, but it is in our
power to make the reverse judgment ourselves.
Rephrasings, you may have noticed, are important in Stoicism. There are
correspondences in Christianity (hate the sin, not the sinner), and according to
modern psychological research, recasting a situation is a crucial component of
anger and emotional management. Still, I was wondering whether Epictetus
wasn’t a bit too casual about his attitude toward robbery and crime, so I pointed
that out to him. I should have seen the response coming: “‘What!’ you say.
‘Ought not this robber and this adulterer to be put to death?’ Nay, say not so, but
rather, ‘Should I not destroy this man who is in error and delusion about the
greatest matters and is blinded not merely in the vision which distinguishes
white and black, but in the judgement which distinguishes good and evil?’ If you
put it this way, you will recognize how inhuman your words are; that it is like
saying, ‘Should I not kill this blind man, or this deaf one?’” I actually hadn’t
suggested anything like the death penalty, but the point was well taken: if we
understand the ancient Greek concept of amathia, we know that it is more
helpful to think of people who do bad things as mistaken and therefore to be
pitied and helped if possible, not condemned as evil. Although not very much
practiced, especially in the United States, this same idea is behind some of the
most progressive, and effective, approaches to reforming criminals as
implemented, for instance, in a number of European countries.
It is rather instructive to look at the advice of the American Psychological

Association for people dealing with anger and frustration, because it very closely
resembles the early intuitions of the Stoics—strengthened, of course, by a
significant amount of systematic empirical findings. To begin with, the APA
counsels engaging in a series of relaxation techniques. These include deep
breathing (from the diaphragm, not the chest), coupled with a simple and
meaningful mantra. You can also use imagery—visualizing, for instance, a
calming or pleasant situation—and engage in some sort of nonstrenuous
exercise, like yoga stretching. Although the Stoics didn’t deploy the concept of
mantra, they constantly advised practitioners to keep simple, pithy phrases at
hand and to reach for them as soon as they saw trouble. Indeed, the entire
Enchiridion, Arrian’s summary of Epictetus’s Discourses, can be considered a
handy set of quick reminders of crucial points for use on the spur of the moment.
And Seneca explicitly advised taking a deep breath and going for a walk around
the block upon first feeling the uncontrollable rise of rage, which he considered a
type of temporary madness. He also said, in his letters to his friend Lucilius, that
it is good to exercise regularly, even in old age, not just because exercise keeps
the body in decent shape, but because it has a calming effect on the mind. I have
found all of this advice to be very effective: my favorite immediate reaction,
whenever I sense that I’m beginning to lose control, is to excuse myself, retreat
to a quiet place where I can do a little deep breathing (even a bathroom will do!),
and mentally repeat my favorite mantra: bear and forbear, which is a standard
Epictetian phrase.
This advice, a sort of physiological and mental first-aid kit, is useful for
immediate crises, but a number of longer-term strategies must also be deployed
if anger is to be effectively managed, according to the APA. One set of strategies
involves cognitive restructuring, of which we have seen plenty of Stoic
examples, including the ones just discussed. The APA tells us to change standard
phrases like “this is terrible!” to something along the lines of “I’d rather not have
to deal with this, but I can manage it, and getting angry isn’t going to help me at
all.” Moreover, the suggestion is to transform demands into desires, in
recognition that the world isn’t just going to bow down to whatever we like. This
is very similar to the modern Stoic idea, proposed by Bill Irvine, of learning to
internalize goals: I desire (not want or need) a promotion, so I’m going to do my
best to deserve it. Whether I actually get it or not is not under my control,
because it depends on a number of factors external to my will. As an APA article
on anger management—which could easily have been written by Epictetus—
reminds us: “Logic defeats anger, because anger, even when it’s justified, can

quickly become irrational. So use cold hard logic on yourself.”
Next, the APA advises us to engage in problem-solving (rather than
complaining), but warns us against a common fallacy: we need to realize that—
contra common cultural belief—it just isn’t the case that every problem has a
solution. We therefore need to cut ourselves some slack for not being able to
solve everything, so long as we have done all we can reasonably do under the
circumstances. Don’t focus on just finding a solution, the APA advises, but on
how to handle the entire situation, including the possibility of not succeeding in
the endeavor. Again, echoes of ancient wisdom abound here.
Another crucial way of handling anger is classified by the APA as “better
communication,” specifically better communication with people who make you
angry. Interestingly, a large component of this advice relies again on Stoic
precepts: we should try to describe the situation making us angry as
dispassionately and accurately as possible, what Epictetus called giving assent to
(or withdrawing assent from) our impressions, as I did when my wallet was
stolen. Rather than reacting immediately to what another person is saying—
which is never a good idea, as doing so will simply escalate a heated situation—
we can slow down, rephrase what the other person is saying, take the time to
analyze the possible underlying reasons, and only then respond. For example,
you may interpret a request from your companion as an undue and irritating
invasion of your personal space. But could it be that the request arises from your
companion’s need for more attention and care, a need that could be
accommodated in some other way that would not make you feel like you have
entered a prison?
The APA also counsels humor as an antidote to anger, and we have seen this
deployed both by ancient Stoics like Epictetus (If I have to die now, then I die
now; but if later, then now I’m going to dine, because it’s dinnertime) and by
modern ones like Irvine (Oh, you think that essay I wrote was fundamentally
misguided? That’s because you haven’t read all my other essays!). However, the
APA also rightly recommends using humor judiciously: we should neither
simply laugh off our problems (or, worse, other people’s) nor cross the fuzzy line
between humor and sarcasm. Sarcasm, an aggressive and belittling type of
response, is rarely useful, and certainly not in those situations that involve
conflict and anger. But how do we tell the difference between humor and
sarcasm? That takes practice as well as exercising the cardinal virtue of wisdom,
which is precisely about learning how to navigate complex situations that have
no clear line dividing black from white—like, you know, almost all of real life.

Additional suggestions from professional psychologists include changing
your environment, for instance, by taking a physical break from the problematic
situation; shifting the timing of your interaction with another person if the
present moment seems not to be the best time to handle the problem, but being
sure to set an alternative time for coming back to it in order to send the signal
that you are not dodging it; practicing avoidance by not exposing yourself, if
possible, to the cause of your distress; and finding alternative ways of doing
what you need to do that may reduce the opportunity for conflict while still
allowing you to accomplish your goals. We don’t find all of these suggestions in
the ancient Stoic texts, but they’re all in synch with the fundamental Stoic idea
that to live a good life we have to learn about how the world actually works (as
opposed to how we wish it would work), and that we must also learn how to
reason correctly in order to best handle the world as it is. Appreciating and using
the pertinent findings of modern psychology to flourish in our lives, then, is a
most Stoic thing to do.

EPICTETUS HAD A FEW INTERESTING THINGS TO TELL ME about anxiety as well. I used
to be more anxious than I am now, a change that I attribute largely to experience
(as it turns out, many things are not as bad as one imagines them to be before
they happen) and a bit of the emotional maturity that is almost inevitable with
the passing of the years and the changing of one’s hormonal profile. But
Epictetus helped me make an additional leap forward. He pointed out, for
instance, that just as anger isn’t usually very reasonable, neither is anxiety, and
in fact both feelings can seriously get in the way of our projects and our quality
of life.
Why are we so anxious about all sorts of things? “When I see a man in a state
of anxiety, I say, ‘What can this man want? If he did not want something which
is not in his power, how could he still be anxious? It is for this reason that one
who sings to the lyre is not anxious when he is performing by himself, but when
he enters the theatre, even if he has a very good voice and plays well: for he not
only wants to perform well, but also to win a great name, and that is beyond his
own control.’” This is yet another version of Epictetus’s cardinal idea of the
dichotomy of control, but the way he puts it in this passage struck me as so
obviously true, and so applicable to countless personal experiences, that my
reaction was a loud “Duh! How could I have missed this?”
When I go, say, in front of a classroom full of students, I have no reason to be

anxious, because I am well prepared to explain the material at hand. I’m a
professional, I know what I’m doing, and I have a lot of experience with the
subject matter—certainly much more than any of my students. The anxiety, then,
is caused by an underlying fear of somehow disappointing the students, of not
being sufficiently clear, entertaining, helpful, and so on. But the only way to
avoid such failures is to do what I have already done: prepare myself to the best
of my abilities. Nothing else can be done, so there is no cause for (additional)
concern, much less for anxiety over the outcome. This, again, is not counsel to
ignore or belittle my duties to my students. It is simply a reasonable
reassessment of the situation I find myself in, in order to arrive at a useful
distinction between the things that I should and should not be concerned about.
Moreover, should I indeed “embarrass” myself in front of my class, what exactly
is the worst thing that could happen? That some young people will laugh at my
mistake, whatever it was? Worse things happen at sea, you know, as the Monty
Python song goes.
Let me be clear that I am perfectly aware that some disorders of the mind
may cause a type of anxiety that “cold hard logic,” as the APA puts it, won’t be
able to overcome by itself. But those are disorders, that is, pathological
conditions, for which modern psychology and psychiatry are beginning—
however imperfectly—to provide remedies, in the form of both talk and
pharmaceutical therapies. As my colleague Lou Marinoff put it in the preface to
his best-selling book Plato, Not Prozac!, these therapies will accomplish the
important, but insufficient, task of calming your mind to the point where you can
be functional again. That by itself won’t do the thinking for you, and it is a
rethinking of a whole host of life’s situations that promises to provide a path to
eudaimonia.
That is why it is peculiar that people tend to pay attention to, and be worried
by, exactly the wrong sort of things. Epictetus explained it to me this way: “We
are anxious for our bit of a body, for our bit of property, for what Caesar will
think, but are not anxious at all for what is within us. Am I anxious about not
conceiving a false thought? No, for that depends on myself. Or about indulging
an impulse contrary to nature? No, not about this either.” The point here is more
philosophical than psychological, of course; Epictetus is addressing the longterm course of our lives rather than whatever immediate problem we may face.
But his point is crucial nonetheless. A religious person, putting it slightly
differently, would speak in terms of taking care of one’s soul rather than just
one’s body and possessions, but the idea is the same: we tend to adopt upside-

down priorities, to be worried about things that are ultimately less important and
definitely less under our control than what we should really be worried about
and focusing energy and time on. Let Caesar (or your boss) think what he may—
you yourself have to attend to the crucial task of improving your character and
maintaining your integrity. If he is a good person, Caesar (or your boss) will
appreciate it. If he is not, the loss, ultimately, is his no less than it was for the
thief who stole Epictetus’s lamp, and the one who lifted my wallet.

I LIVE IN A BIG CITY, AND YET I SPEND MOST OF THE DAY ON my own, reading and
writing, either at home or in one of my two offices, both of which are usually
devoid of colleagues or students. I spend my time this way by choice, and it suits
my personality very well. But I couldn’t help bringing up the issue of loneliness
with Epictetus, since it seems to be a major one affecting modern society—not
just the Western variety, and not only in big cities. It isn’t difficult these days to
find headlines that read: “The Loneliness Epidemic: We’re More Connected
Than Ever—But Are We Feeling More Alone?,” “Is Modern Life Making Us
Lonely?,” “The Loneliness of American Society,” and so forth.
A paper published by Colin Killeen in the Journal of Advanced Nursing
offers an interesting discussion of loneliness from a modern, scientific
perspective. To begin with, Killeen distinguishes loneliness from similar, yet
separate, related concepts, such as alienation (which may be the result, or in
some cases the cause, of depression) and solitude (which actually has a positive
connotation, more akin to my own behavior). Interestingly, the paper presents a
classification of what Killeen calls the “alienation-connectedness continuum”
from negative to positive—alienation <> loneliness <> social isolation <>
aloneness <> solitude <> connectedness—with society’s perspective ranging
from negative at the alienation extreme to positive at the connectedness one. The
author superimposes on this continuum what he calls a “choice continuum”—
from no choice (alienation, loneliness) at one extreme to total choice (solitude,
connectedness) at the other. This choice continuum, of course, pertains to
external causes of loneliness, not to internal attitudes, which are more within the
proper domain of Stoic thought.
What are the causes of loneliness? The Killeen paper provides a handy
summary diagram identifying a series of causes related to our situations and our
characters that lead to loneliness, including bereavement, psychological
vulnerability, reduced social network, depression, and radical life changes. These

are accompanied by a number of associated factors, including age, gender, and
health. The bottom line, in Killeen’s view, is that there is no “solution” to the
problem of loneliness, because it is highly multifactorial and because it depends
on both personal (psychological, situational) and structural (societal) factors.
What then? Here is the author’s surprisingly sober yet refreshingly honest
commentary: “[Loneliness] is such an innate part of the human psyche, that it
cannot be solved like a puzzle; it can only be alleviated and made less painful.
This can only be achieved by increasing humankind’s awareness of this
distressing condition that everyone has to endure in some way, shape or form,
sometime during their lives, about which there is nothing to be embarrassed.”
Those words resonate for me in part because they forcefully remind me of
Epictetus’s advice on the same subject: “The forlorn state is the condition of one
without help. For a man is not forlorn simply because he is alone, any more than
a man in a crowd is unforlorn. For according to its conception the term ‘forlorn’
means that a man is without help, exposed to those who wish to harm him. But
nevertheless a man must prepare himself for solitude too—he must be able to
suffice for himself, and able to commune with himself.” As Killeen says: there is
no reason to be embarrassed because (some degree of) loneliness is a natural
condition for humanity, and Stoics reject the whole idea of embarrassment,
especially with respect to societal expectations, because we have no influence
over other people’s judgments, only over our own behavior. Notice also
Killeen’s use of the word “endure,” which is very much what Epictetus is talking
about.
One distinction between loneliness and being alone would have been
perfectly clear to the Stoics: the latter is a factual description, while the former is
a judgment we superimpose on that description, and it is that judgment, not the
naked fact, that makes us feel rejected and powerless. Importantly, however,
there is a positive message in Epictetus’s words, which can seem rather stern at
first glance: the other side of endurance is resilience, and resilience is
empowering. We may have little or no control over the external circumstances
that force us into being alone at some times in our lives. But (save for
pathological conditions, for which one needs to seek medical help), it is our
choice, our own attitude, that turns solitude into loneliness. We may be alone,
but we do not consequently need to feel helpless.

CHAPTER 13

LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP

Whoever then has knowledge of good things, would know how to love
them; but how could one who cannot distinguish good things from evil
and things indifferent from both have power to love?
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, II.22

ONE DAY A DISTRAUGHT FATHER CAME TO SEEK EPICTETUS’S counsel. His daughter
was terribly ill, and he simply couldn’t stand it any longer, so he ran from the
house in pain: “I am so miserable about my poor children, that lately when my
daughter was ill and was thought to be in danger I could not bear to be near her,
but fled away from her, until someone brought me news that she was well.”
“Well, do you think you were right to do it?”
“It was natural, all fathers, or most of us, at least, feel like that.”
Epictetus engaged the distraught father at length, because the Stoics made a
big deal of “following nature,” by which, however, they did not mean just doing
whatever comes “naturally”—like leaving your own child in the care of others
because you are experiencing too much pain. Epictetus told the man that he
didn’t deny that many fathers felt like he did, or that it was a natural way for
fathers to feel. The question, though, was whether it was right. So he proceeded
in classical Socratic fashion: “Was it right, I ask, for you, being affectionately
disposed to your child, to run away and leave her? Is her mother not fond of the
child?”
“She is indeed.”
“Should the mother then have left her too, or should she not?”
“She should not.”
“What of the nurse? Is she fond of the child?”
“She is.”
“Ought she then to have left her?”

“By no means.”
“Again, is not the child’s attendant fond of her?”
“He is.”
“Ought he then to have gone away and left her? Was it right that as a
consequence the child should be thus left desolate and helpless because of the
great affection of you its parents and of those about it, or should die in the hands
of those who had no love or care for it?”
“Heaven forbid!”
“Tell me, would you have liked, if you were ill, your relations and everyone
else, even your wife and children, to show their affection for you in such a way
as to leave you alone and desolate?”
“Certainly not!”
“Would you pray to be so loved by your own people, as to be always left
alone by them when you were ill, because of their exceeding affection, or would
you, if it were a question of being left alone, rather pray, supposing that were
possible, to have the affection of your enemies?”
You see where this is going. And yet many people misunderstand what
Epictetus, and the Stoics more generally, were up to here. Sure, we can follow
his undeniable logic, but isn’t he saying that a father’s love for his daughter boils
down to duty? And isn’t that a rather sterile, even inhuman, view of love and
affection?
It would be, if that superficial reading of the anecdote reflected what
Epictetus actually meant, but it doesn’t—far from it. The point, rather, is that
human affection needs to be guided—trained even—by a sound assessment of
whatever situation triggers our feelings. It is undeniably true that the father
should not have left his daughter just to avoid being in pain himself. This is
elegantly shown by Epictetus, both by way of making the parallel between the
father and his daughter’s other caretakers—in comparison to whom he clearly
behaved badly—and by asking the man to consider for a minute whether he
himself, had he been in the place of his daughter, would have appreciated similar
behavior from a loved one.
But that’s only half of the Stoic point: there is a difference between what is
natural and what is right, and we ought to arrive at correct judgments that will
sometimes make us override what is natural in favor of what is right. This point
derives from the Stoic theory of oikeiôsis, which we have already encountered in
the form of Hierocles’s widening (or, to be precise, contracting) circles of
concern. The idea is that we begin life with only instinctual behaviors, some of

which are rather selfish, just like the father’s “natural” reaction to his daughter’s
pain. Once we enter the age of reason in mid-childhood, however, we begin to be
able to reflect on things and to separate natural from good when necessary. But
this isn’t just a matter of letting “cold” reason take over our emotions. It doesn’t
work that way, and if the Stoics had really advocated such a simplistic notion,
they’d have been really poor psychologists—which they most definitely were
not.
Epictetus once told his students: “But though we are capable of writing and
reading these sentiments, though we can praise them as we read, yet they do not
bring conviction to us, nor anything like it. Wherefore the proverb about the
Lacedaemonians, Lions at home, foxes at Ephesus, will fit us too. In the lectureroom we are lions, and foxes in the world outside!” What he meant was that
simply recognizing the truth of something is not enough: you need to practice it,
over and over, until you develop a habit that incorporates a rational conclusion
into your instinctual repertoire. Think of practicing philosophy in the same way
you learn to drive a car, or to kick a soccer ball, or to play the saxophone.
Initially, it’s all about paying conscious attention to what you’re doing, and
asking why, and as a result you are pretty bad at it, constantly making mistakes
and getting frustrated. But little by little, the repetition of deliberate movements
makes your actions more and more automatic, until it becomes second nature to
hit the brakes when someone unexpectedly crosses the street, to pass the ball to
your teammate who is suddenly unguarded by the other team’s defense, or to hit
the right sequence of notes at the right pace to produce the melody you want out
of your instrument. True philosophy is a matter of a little theory and a lot of
practice: “We see that the carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning certain
things, the helmsman becomes a helmsman by learning certain things. May we,
then, infer that in the sphere of conduct too it is not enough merely to wish to
become good, but one must learn certain things?… For it is not arguments that
are wanting nowadays: no, the books of the Stoics are full of them. What then is
the one thing wanting? We want the man who will apply his arguments, and bear
witness to them by action.”
Despite Epictetus’s (right) emphasis on practice, the ancient Greeks actually
developed a sophisticated theoretical understanding of love, espousing a number
of different conceptions of it, some of which are pertinent to the second subject
of this chapter: friendship. Typically, scholars distinguish among agápe, éros,
philía, and storgē Agápe refers to the sort of love that you feel for your spouse
and children, and that later on Christians associated with God’s love for all

humanity: as Thomas Aquinas put it, agápe is to will the good of another. If you
think you know what éros means, you may have to think again. Yes, the word
does carry the overt meaning of sensual pleasure and sexual attraction, but, as
Plato explained in the Symposium, éros develops into an appreciation of the
inner beauty of a person, through which we express our admiration for beauty
itself, regardless of its specific incarnation. Philía is the dispassionate, virtuous
love that we feel for friends, family, and community because we see and treat
them as equal to ourselves. Finally, storgē, a far less frequently used word,
specifically refers to love for your children but also, interestingly, for your
country or sports team. It carries the meaning of an inherently felt love that has
nothing to do with reason or reflection.
It is hard to deny that the single English word “love” simply doesn’t quite
catch all of these nuances, which is unfortunate, since we surely ought to
distinguish the love we feel toward our partners, children, and friends from what
we feel for, say, our country and God. In all cases, however, the Stoic question
would be the very same one that Epictetus posed to the distraught father: it may
be natural, but is it right?
We are often told, for instance, that we should love our country, “right or
wrong,” or our sports team regardless of whether they win or lose. I presume that
both would be a storgē type of love, but a Stoic would argue that loving
something “right or wrong” applies differently to the two cases. Indeed, that
famous phrase has two sources, one derived from the other, that can be used to
see why the Stoics were correct in saying that some kinds of love—the important
ones—need to be squared with what is right, not just with our feelings about the
matter. The original attribution of the quote is to Stephen Decatur, a US naval
officer who allegedly said in an after-dinner toast in 1816: “Our Country! In her
intercourse with foreign nations may she always be in the right; but right or
wrong, our country!” Compare this with the derivative version, attributed to US
Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz, who used it in remarks before the Senate
on February 29, 1872: “My country, right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; and
if wrong, to be set right.”
I submit that the Decatur version is more appropriate for a sports team: “AS
Roma! In her intercourse with other teams may she always be victorious; but
winner or loser, AS Roma!” There is something charming in harmless loyalty to
a sports team, regardless, and in fact especially, if they tend to be on the losing
side. But blind allegiance to your country can be—and historically has been,
countless times—extremely dangerous. Indeed, I’m not aware of whether Schurz

ever read Epictetus, but the US secretary essentially made the same point the
philosopher did with the story of the distraught father: yes, it is understandable,
and even commendable, to have certain natural feelings for our offspring or
country. But since we are talking about human beings and foreign policy,
respectively, not about sports teams, reason ought to be called in to guide us in
our actions: I may feel like fleeing the house because I can’t bear to see my
daughter in pain, but the right thing to do is to stand by her and support her. I
may feel like my country is a crucial part of my identity, which therefore justifies
my having special regard for it, but if it is about to engage in actions that are
deleterious to itself or to others, then I have a duty to speak out. If something
really matters, feelings and reason cannot be decoupled and the latter promptly
ignored.

SINCE FRIENDSHIP IS A TYPE OF LOVE, ACCORDING TO THE Greco-Romans, it is
natural that it receives the same Stoic treatment from Epictetus as family
relations:
For where else is friendship but where faith and honour are, where men
give and take what is good, and nothing else? “But he has paid me
attention all this time: did he not love me?” How do you know, slave,
whether he has paid you this attention, as a man cleans his boots, or tends
his beast? How do you know whether, when you have lost your use as a
paltry vessel, he will not throw you away like a broken plate?… Were not
Eteocles and Polynices born of the same mother and the same father?
Were they not reared together, did they not live together, drink together,
sleep together, often kiss one another, so that if one had seen them he
would, no doubt, have laughed at the paradoxes of philosophers on
friendship. Yet when the bit of meat, in the shape of a king’s throne, fell
between them, see what they say:
E. Where wilt stand upon the tower?
P. Wherefore dost thou ask me this?
E. I will face thee then and slay thee.
P. I desire thy blood no less.
—EURIPIDES, THE PHOENISSAE, 621

Okay, the Master went poetic on me, and besides, Eteocles and Polynices
were brothers, not just friends, but his point is well taken: true friendship, like
true love, is revealed when the going gets tough, not when things are nice and
easy.
From a Stoic perspective, friendship, like everything else except our own
moral character, is a preferred indifferent. This raises interesting questions, since
it means, for instance, that there cannot be any such thing as (Stoic) friendship
between criminals, if “criminal” refers not just to someone wanted by the law
(after all, Nelson Mandela was a criminal from the point of view of the South
African apartheid government), but to a person who engages in despicable acts
of violence or thievery. This is true not only because it is rather difficult to
imagine a virtuous criminal, but also because every time a criminal helps his
criminal friend with, say, getting away with escaping justice, he puts his
friendship for the other ahead of moral integrity—precisely the reverse of the
Stoic set of priorities.
The same problem applies to love, both toward our relatives and toward our
companion. The world’s literature (including Greco-Roman literature) is full of
stories of people putting love above everything else, leading on occasion to
rather nasty consequences for themselves, the other person, or innocent third
parties. But we are often encouraged to admire these individuals, because, after
all, “love conquers all.” Besides the fact that “love conquers all” only in a highly
Disneyfied world, the Stoics would simply say that those are not cases of true
friendship or true love, precisely because they show “friendship” and “love”
trumping a person’s moral character. We have already encountered Medea, who,
before she went completely mad and killed her own children in revenge against
her unfaithful husband, Jason, betrayed her father and killed her brother in order
to help Jason steal the legendary Golden Fleece—allegedly, out of love for him.
According to the Stoics, whatever it was that Medea felt for Jason, that
sentiment wasn’t really love. And neither is what is often labeled the same way
in plenty of contemporary everyday news stories that are just as horrifying as the
ancient tale of Medea.
Now, one could reasonably suspect that the Stoics were up to semantic tricks
when they maintained that what many people consider friendship or love are in
fact no such thing. But that would be to miss the point: the Stoics were both keen
observers of human psychology (a descriptive activity) and sophisticated
thinkers about human morality (a prescriptive activity). They would have easily

granted that Medea felt what is commonly described as “love” toward Jason, or
that, say, two Mafia bosses may be “friends” according to standard parlance. But
they would have added, on the strength of their understanding of ethics, that
these are the wrong words to describe what is going on in these cases. Why does
this matter? Because if we use “love” and “friendship” to describe both
situations in which morality is trumped and situations in which it is central, then
we confuse things by not making semantic distinctions where there are
substantive differences. “It’s just semantics” is a weird dismissal of sometimes
necessary clarifications of language, because our ability to communicate with
and understand each other depends on semantics—that is, on our accurate use of
language.
Let me give you an example from Aristotle, who was definitely not a Stoic.
(Seneca, certainly a Stoic, used to help himself to the thoughts of the rival school
of Epicurus, arguing that truth is the property of everyone, regardless of where it
comes from, so I’m simply following his lead here.) Aristotle was arguably a bit
obsessed with taxonomies; for instance, he proposed a whopping twelve
different types of virtue rather than the Stoics’ simple four, even though all types
of virtue are really just different aspects of wisdom. When it comes to friendship,
Aristotle focused in particular on philía, which, we have seen, refers to relations
not just with those whom we today would call friends but also with close family
—that’s why it’s not strange that Epictetus brings up the story of the brothers
Eteocles and Polynices in his discussion of friendship. Aristotle distinguished
among three types of friendship that I think still provide a useful framework
today: friendship of utility, friendship of pleasure, and friendship of the good.
A friendship of utility is what we nowadays would call an acquaintance based
on reciprocal advantage—say, for instance, your relationship with your favorite
hairdresser. My mother used to run such a shop for many years in Rome, and it
was clear from even a casual observation that her relationship with her clients
was not just one of business. These women spent a significant amount of time,
over prolonged periods of their lives, having their hair or other aesthetic work,
like nails and such, done by my mother and her assistants. While the work was
professionally attended to, there was much talk about all sorts of things, ranging
from personal affairs to politics. (I don’t remember much philosophy being
discussed, though.) This certainly didn’t make my mother a “friend” of the
women in her parlor in the strict sense of the term, but it did make her more than
just an anonymous person with whom they simply made business transactions.
The ancients’ idea was a good one: even though the relationship is largely

established on mutual practical benefit and may terminate as soon as such
benefit is exhausted, we still want to behave cordially and have positive social
intercourse with other human beings, since it is the right and pleasurable thing to
do—right because we are treating others as ends in themselves, not just as means
to our ends, as Kant would have put it; and pleasurable because we are by nature
social beings who derive satisfaction from talking to other social beings.
A “friendship of pleasure,” the second Aristotelian category of philía, is
rather obviously based on (again, reciprocal) pleasure. Think of your drinking
buddies, or people with whom you share a hobby. Like friendship of utility, this
one too is based on mutual advantage, only this time the advantage is not
instrumental but pleasurable. Just as with friendships of utility, friendships of
pleasure don’t need to be deep, though in modern English usage we would
probably deploy the word “friend” rather than “acquaintance” in these cases.
And of course, like friendships of utility, friendships of pleasure may also end
once the pertinent social glue dissolves—for instance, because we lose interest in
a particular hobby, or discover a new watering hole in a different part of town.
The third category of Aristotelian friendship goes well beyond the minimal
requirements that most people would expect to be met before calling someone a
friend: a friendship of the good is that rare phenomenon when two people enjoy
each other for their own sake because they find in each other an affinity of
character that does not require externalities like a business exchange or a hobby.
In those cases, our friends become, as Aristotle famously put it, mirrors to our
souls, helping us grow and become better persons just because they care about
us. Again, you can see why “friendship of the good” may refer not just to
friendships in the modern sense of the term but also to relationships with family
members or with our companion.
Once more, Aristotle was no Stoic, and the Stoics would have said that the
only friendship that truly deserves to be called a friendship is that of the good.
Crucially, however, they would not have denied either the existence or the
importance of the other two classes. But they would have confined them to the
category of “preferred indifferents”: things you may very well have and
cultivate, so long as they don’t interfere with your virtues and moral integrity.
It is noteworthy that the Greco-Roman categorizations of types of love and
friendship are not just much richer than our own, but also somewhat differently
organized conceptually: they associated aspects of relationships that we keep
distinct, as when we differentiate “friends” (of one type) from family members
(of another type) from business acquaintances. In the end, concepts, and the

words that allow us to deploy them, are useful insofar as they help us navigate
the realities of our world, especially our social environment. But it will come as
no surprise to the reader that I admire the ancients’ rich vocabulary in this
respect and would suggest that perhaps we lost something significant when we
pared down our own language. After all, a meaningfully richer language reflects
a more nuanced thinking and a better ability to negotiate existence.

CHAPTER 14

PRACTICAL SPIRITUAL EXERCISES

Admit not sleep into your tender eyelids till you have reckoned up each
deed of the day—How have I erred, what done or left undone? So start,
and so review your acts, and then for vile deeds chide yourself, for good
be glad.
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, III.10

WE HAVE TALKED ENOUGH WITH EPICTETUS, I THINK, TO have a good grasp of what
Stoicism is about, both in theory and as practically applied to everyday life,
whether in the Roman Empire in the second century BCE or now during the
twenty-first century. How, then, are we supposed to actually experience Stoicism
as a living philosophy?
There is no single way, nor is there a fixed set of doctrines resembling
anything like a religious catechism to go by—which I think is an unqualified
positive. But there are people—such as myself and the authors of a number of
other recent books on Stoicism—who have developed a practice based on a
combination of what is actually found in ancient texts, modern techniques
derived from cognitive behavioral and similar therapies, and just what does and
does not work for us individually. Different approaches to Stoicism work better
for different people, so it is best to treat the advice that follows as a set of
suggestions, not as rigid rules to stick to no matter what.
Naturally, I consulted Epictetus himself, and he directed me to his
Enchiridion, which literally means “handbook.” Of course, he didn’t write the
book (as far as we know, he didn’t write anything, really); the Enchiridion was
put together by Arrian of Nicomedia. Now, I’m not sure how comfortable I
would feel if my only legacy to humanity was a bunch of notes on my lectures
taken by one of my students, but some students are brighter than others, and at
any rate, this is what we have from Epictetus. Naturally, our legacy is yet another

thing we do not control, though we have control over how we interpret and use
someone else’s.
Then again, Arrian wasn’t just your average student, even for the times. He
became a well-known historian, a military commander, and a public servant of
the Roman Empire, being elected Consul in 130 CE, then Prefect of the Province
of Cappadocia. Arrian probably attended Epictetus’s school between 117 and
120 CE, then remained attached to his Master in Nicopolis for a while. Arrian
eventually left for Athens, and subsequently embarked on a distinguished career,
which included being appointed senator by Emperor Hadrian. When he retired,
Arrian went back to Athens, where he became Archon, or chief magistrate
(apparently he couldn’t just stand still and do nothing). He died during the reign
of Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic emperor. The poet Lucian of Samosata wrote that
Arrian was “a Roman of the first rank with a life-long attachment to learning.”
Having notes on my lectures taken by that sort of student would, I think, be more
than acceptable.
I have gone through the Enchiridion, compiled by Arrian on the basis of
Epictetus’s lectures, and distilled twelve “spiritual exercises,” or Stoic reminders
of how to act in everyday life. The best way to begin using them, I think, would
be to attach to your calendar a handy list of them, in no particular order. (They
are presented here simply in the sequence in which they appear in the
Enchiridion.) These days there are plenty of apps for smart phones and the like
that will easily allow you to do this. Set up the list in such a way that you’ll be
reminded of one of these practices every day, in rotation (or, to make things
more interesting, at random). Each day reread Epictetus’s words several times,
whenever you have a minute, and focus on putting into practice that day a
specific piece of advice. The first goal is to become mindful of the Stoic way to
think and—most importantly—act. Eventually, the exercises should become so
second nature that you won’t need the reminders (though I still have them pop
up on my calendar, just in case) and will be able to practice them spontaneously,
applying them to all the small and big events and situations of your life.
The exercises that follow naturally make the most sense when understood
through the lens of Stoic philosophy. So before discussing the exercises
themselves, let me recap some of the fundamental principles of Stoicism we
have learned throughout the book.
We have encountered a number of Stoic ideas during our conversations with
Epictetus, beginning most importantly with the three Stoic disciplines—desire,
action, and assent—and their relationship with the three areas of study—physics,

ethics, and logic—as discussed in Chapter 2. (This may be a good time to go
back to that discussion and refresh your understanding of these disciplines and
areas of study.) The disciplines have been the logical backbone for the entire
sequence of chapters in this book. Distilled to their bare minimum (in order to
derive the most benefit from these spiritual exercises), the Stoic principles are as
follows:
1. Virtue is the highest good, and everything else is indifferent. The Stoics got
the first part from Socrates, who argued that virtue is the chief good
because it is the only thing that is valuable under all circumstances and that
helps us make proper use of things like health, wealth, and education.
Everything else is indifferent in the specifically Stoic sense that nothing is
to be traded against virtue. The Stoic can pursue the preferred indifferents
and try to stay away from the dispreferred ones, so long as doing so doesn’t
interfere with virtue. In modern economic theory, this well-known approach
is called a system of lexicographic preferences. To illustrate, you have a
lexicographic preference if you wouldn’t trade your daughter for a
Lamborghini, no matter how much you’d love to have a Lamborghini.
2. Follow nature. That is, apply reason to social life. The Stoics thought that
we should take a hint from how the universe is put together in figuring out
how to live our lives. Since human beings are naturally social animals
capable of reason, it follows that we should strive to apply reason to
achieve a better society.
3. Dichotomy of control. Some things are under our control, and others are not
(though we may be able to influence them). If we are sufficiently healthy
mentally, our decisions and behaviors are under our control. Outside of our
control is everything else. We should concern ourselves with what is under
our control and handle everything else with equanimity.
Moreover, while engaging in the exercises proposed here, remember that they
are supposed to further your mastery of the four Stoic virtues:
(Practical) wisdom: Navigating complex situations in the best available
fashion
Courage: Doing the right thing, both physically and morally, under all

circumstances
Justice: Treating every human being—regardless of his or her stature in
life—with fairness and kindness
Temperance: Exercising moderation and self-control in all spheres of life
Now that we have reviewed the basic principles underlying the Stoic system,
we are better equipped to examine (and put into practice!) the twelve exercises I
extracted from Epictetus’s (well, actually, Arrian’s) Enchiridion:
1. Examine your impressions. “So make a practice at once of saying to
every strong impression: ‘An impression is all you are, not the source of the
impression.’ Then test and assess it with your criteria, but one primarily: ask, ‘Is
this something that is, or is not, in my control?’ And if it’s not one of the things
that you control, be ready with the reaction, ‘Then it’s none of my concern.’”
This is the classic dichotomy of control with which we began this book.
Epictetus exhorts us to practice what is arguably the most fundamental of his
doctrines: to constantly examine our “impressions”—that is, our initial reactions
to events, people, and what we are being told—by stepping back to make room
for rational deliberation, avoiding rash emotional reactions, and asking whether
whatever is being thrown at us is under our control (in which case we should act
on it) or isn’t (in which case we should regard it as not of our concern).
For instance, a few days before writing this I got food poisoning (from
spoiled fish) and experienced a pretty bad forty-eight hours, during which I
could hardly do anything interesting, let alone work and write. Ordinarily, this
would be something “bad,” an experience that most of us might be inclined to
complain about and seek sympathy for. The biochemistry of my body and of
potentially pathogenic agents, however, is most definitely not under my control
(though deciding to eat fish at that particular restaurant certainly was). So it
made no sense for me to complain about being sick with food poisoning, since I
could not change what had already happened. And though it is certainly human
to seek sympathy, even that response—from a Stoic perspective—is an
imposition on others in order to feel better ourselves, in a situation in which,
moreover, others cannot do much more than pity us. It is perfectly acceptable for
a Stoic to sympathize with others, but it seems a bit self-centered to require
sympathy from others when we are sick ourselves. Instead, I acted in accordance
with Epictetus’s words: I accepted what was happening as a fact of biology, took
the medical precautions that seemed to be in order (taking some probiotics), and
then adjusted my mental attitude to my predicament. I couldn’t work or write.

Well, then, I would not even try, since there were other things I could do instead,
and at any rate I was very likely to recover quickly, after which there would be
plenty of time to work and write.
One last comment here: the “it’s none of my concern” bit is often
misunderstood. The idea isn’t that we should not care about what is happening to
us. During my bout of food poisoning, for instance, I was forcefully reminded
that health is ranked by the Stoics as a preferred indifferent—something that is to
be sought unless it compromises our integrity and virtue. But if there truly is
nothing more to be done about a given situation, then we should no longer
“concern” ourselves with it—we should stop trying to do something about the
situation—precisely because it is outside of our control. Larry Becker calls this
the “axiom of futility,” which he spells out in rather crisp terms: “Agents are
required not to make direct attempts to do (or be) something that is logically,
theoretically, or practically impossible.” Wise words, it seems to me.
2. Remind yourself of the impermanence of things. “In the case of
particular things that delight you, or benefit you, or to which you have grown
attached, remind yourself of what they are. Start with things of little value. If it is
china you like, for instance, say, ‘I am fond of a piece of china.’ When it breaks,
then you won’t be as disconcerted. When giving your wife or child a kiss, repeat
to yourself, ‘I am kissing a mortal.’ Then you won’t be so distraught if they are
taken from you.”
This very famous passage from the Enchiridion shocks students when they
first hear it. It is one of the most misinterpreted bits of Stoic wisdom, sometimes
even willfully so. That is why it is all the more important that we understand it
properly. The troublesome part, of course, is not what Epictetus says about the
piece of china, but the part that follows concerning one’s wife or child. If
Epictetus had stopped at the first example, I think we would have all taken this
to be a reasonable reminder not to get attached to things, perhaps even a secondcentury warning against consumerism. (Consumerism is not a modern American
invention; there was plenty of it going around at the time of the Roman Empire
—for those, then as now of course, who could actually afford to consume.) The
second part, however, reveals a truly deep insight into the human condition, and
may require some background to be properly appreciated. After all, Stoicism
was thought of by its practitioners as a philosophy of love—not of callous
disregard for human beings and their sufferings.
First off, let’s remind ourselves of the historical context: Epictetus was
writing at a time when even emperors (like Marcus Aurelius himself) lost most

of their children and other loved ones at what we would consider a tender or
premature age, to disease, random violence, or war. While most of us in the West
and in a few other parts of the world are currently lucky in that respect
(especially if we happen to be white and male), it remains true today that life is
ephemeral, and people we deeply care about may be snatched from us suddenly
and without warning.
Second, and more crucially, what Epictetus is counseling here is not an
inhuman indifference toward our beloved ones, but quite the opposite: we should
constantly remind ourselves of just how precious our loved ones are precisely
because they may soon be gone. Anyone who has lost someone they were close
to ought to know exactly what this means. The idea is that we should go through
life just as the Roman generals did during official celebrations of their triumphs
in the Eternal City: with somebody constantly whispering in our ear, “Memento
homo” (Remember, you are only a man).
Forgive me if, again, I make this personal. I lost my mother to cancer at about
the time I was beginning to study Stoicism seriously. I had lost my father to the
same disease (and probably because of the same triggering factor, smoking) a
decade earlier. Both those losses affected me deeply, not because I had had an
idyllic relationship with either of my parents (I hadn’t, and instead feel most
indebted to my paternal grandmother and her partner, my adoptive grandfather,
with whom I grew up), but because they marked the passing of the very two
individuals who brought me into this world. Losing one’s parents is a rite of
passage for most of us (unless we happen to die before them), and anyone who
has gone through the experience will testify to how hard it is, regardless of the
specific circumstances. Yet I observed that the way I handled the illness and
subsequent death of each of my parents was very different in the two instances.
When my father was diagnosed with the first of what turned out to be a
number of distinct types of cancer, I simply did not take seriously the idea that I
was going to have only a few more chances to spend some time with him—not
only because of the suddenly shortened time horizon (he died at age sixty-nine),
but also because we were living almost 7,000 kilometers apart, he in Rome and I
in New York. I kept behaving as if we had all the time in the world and quite
simply refused to internalize what my mind knew very well: what was
happening was probably going to kill my father in a short time. It ended up
taking about five years, but I still managed to be caught unaware by his final
decline; as a result, I was not there when he finally died. (I was en route to the
New York airport to take the flight for Rome.)

I always regretted the way I responded to my father’s illness—until Stoicism
taught me that regret is about things we can no longer change and the right
attitude is to learn from our experiences, not dwell on decisions that we are not
in a position to alter. Which brings me to my mother. Her demise was actually
faster, and we didn’t even realize what was happening for a while because of an
initial misdiagnosis. But once the picture became clear, I was able to return to
Italy and visit her with full awareness—and acceptance—of what was going on.
Every time I left her at the hospital, after having kissed her good-bye, Epictetus’s
words rang comfortingly true. I really did not know whether I would see her the
following day. None of this made the experience any less hard, since Stoicism
isn’t a magic wand. But I tried my best to be present in the hic et nunc, the here
and now, as the Romans used to say. That mindfulness is what Epictetus is
attempting to instill in his students: far from counseling us not to care (despite
the “you won’t be so distraught” of the English translation, which inevitably
loses some of the poignancy of the original Greek), he is advising us to care and
appreciate very much what we now have, precisely because Fate may snatch it
from us tomorrow.
3. The reserve clause. “Whenever planning an action, mentally rehearse
what the plan entails. If you are heading out to bathe, picture to yourself the
typical scene at the bathhouse—people splashing, pushing, yelling and pinching
your clothes. You will complete the act with more composure if you say at the
outset, ‘I want a bath, but at the same time I want to keep my will aligned with
nature’ [that is, to apply reason to social living]. Do it with every act. That way if
something occurs to spoil your bath, you will have ready the thought, ‘Well, this
was not my only intention, I also meant to keep my will in line with nature—
which is impossible if I go all to pieces whenever anything bad happens.’”
I love the “which is impossible if I go all to pieces whenever anything bad
happens” bit. It conjures an image of people who are too fragile to withstand
even minor challenges in life because they let themselves be fragile. They
always assume that of course things will go well, since bad things only happen
to other people (possibly because they somehow deserve them). Instead, as
Stoics, we should bring the reserve clause to anything we do, and even use it as a
personal mantra: Fate permitting.
Notice again that Epictetus here begins with a very simple situation: he wants
to go to the baths and enjoy the experience. Just as we may want to go to the
movies, say, and be able to watch the film without the glare of cell phones being
lit up by obnoxious people who just have to check their messages one more time

or else. Here too I speak from personal experience of course: I used to get really
mad when this happened, and would occasionally engage the offender in a loud
argument that, predictably, went nowhere. These days I react by deploying two
of the Stoic techniques we have seen so far: First, of course, I think of the
dichotomy of control. Going to the movies is under my control (I could, after all,
watch another film at home or do something else entirely), and so is my reaction
to other people’s behaviors. And though the latter are certainly not under my
control, I can influence them: by politely explaining to another movie patron
why what he or she is doing is inconsiderate, or by going to the movie house’s
management and—again calmly and politely—complaining about the situation,
since it is their responsibility to ensure that paying customers have an enjoyable
experience while frequenting their establishment.
The second technique to deploy is the reserve clause, properly understood.
Once more, Epictetus is not counseling us to passively accept other people’s
rudeness, but rather reminding us that we may set out with a particular goal in
mind but that events may not go the way we wish. That being the case, our
choices are to make ourselves miserable, thereby willfully worsening our
situation, or to remember our overarching goal: to be a decent person who
doesn’t do anything that is unvirtuous or that may compromise our integrity (like
behaving obnoxiously in reaction to another’s obnoxious behavior).
There is a nice analogy in Stoic lore meant to explain the point. It is
attributed to Chrysippus—the third head of the original Stoa of Athens—and
was allegedly recounted in one of Epictetus’s lost volumes of the Discourses.
Imagine a dog who is leashed to a cart. The cart begins to move forward, in
whatever direction the driver, but certainly not the dog, chooses. Now, the leash
is long enough that the dog has two options: either he can gingerly follow the
general direction of the cart, over which he has no control, and thereby enjoy the
ride and even have time to explore his surroundings and attend to some of his
own business, or he can stubbornly resist the cart with all his might and end up
being dragged, kicking and screaming, for the rest of the trip, accumulating
much pain and frustration and wasting his time in a futile and decidedly
unpleasant effort. We humans are, of course, the dog: the universe keeps
churning according to God’s will (if you have religious inclinations) or cosmic
cause and effect (if your taste is more secular). But you do have some room to
maneuver, while you are alive and well, and can choose to enjoy the ride, even
as you remain aware of the constraints you have and know that whatever you
wish to accomplish always comes with a big caveat: Fate (the cart driver, God,

the universe) permitting. This is what it means to do whatever you do while
“keeping in line with nature.”
There is yet another way to interpret the message of this exercise, and I thank
my friend Bill Irvine for expressing it particularly clearly in his book A Guide to
the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy. Let’s suppose that you are playing a
tennis match or, more consequentially, being considered for a promotion at your
job. The Stoic approach to both situations is the one counseled by Epictetus, and
one that Bill reinterprets as internalizing your goals. While we naturally think
that our goal is to win the match, or get the promotion, those outcomes of course
are not in our control—they can only be influenced by us. So we need to make
our goal something that actually is in our power and not even Fate can rob us of:
to play the best match we can, regardless of outcome, or to put together the best
promotion file we can before the decision is made. By now I should not need to
add the usual caveat, but repetita iuvant (repetition is helpful), as the Romans
said: the idea is not to passively accept defeat in the tennis match, or perhaps
absorb the injustice of not getting a promotion that was richly deserved. Rather,
it is to deploy the wisdom that sometimes things will not go our way even if we
do our best, and regardless of whether we deserved to win the match or get the
promotion. Not to confuse one’s aspirations, even well-grounded ones, with how
the universe will (or ought to) act is one of the hallmarks of a wise person.
4. How can I use virtue here and now? “For every challenge, remember the
resources you have within you to cope with it. Provoked by the sight of a
handsome man or a beautiful woman, you will discover within you the contrary
power of self-restraint. Faced with pain, you will discover the power of
endurance. If you are insulted, you will discover patience. In time, you will grow
to be confident that there is not a single impression that you will not have the
moral means to tolerate.”
I think of this passage as one of the most empowering of Stoic writings.
Epictetus, the former slave, lame because of a once-broken leg, tells us to use
every occasion, every challenge, as a way to exercise our virtue, to become a
better human being by constant application. Notice how he counters each
temptation or difficulty with a virtue that can be practiced, deploying the Stoic
concept that every challenge in life is a perfectly good chance to work on selfimprovement. When you see an attractive person walking by, you will not
scheme to get that person in bed with you, unless both of you happen to be free
from other relationships and pursuing your desires is not going to cause pain and
suffering to others. Rather, you will summon your self-control and focus on how

you can alter your own mentality so that eventually you will simply not feel the
temptation at all. The second example is of a different kind, and yet it evokes the
same response in a Stoic, with a similar result: you cannot control disease and
pain, and it will happen at some point or another in your life. But you can
manage it, not just with medications (there is certainly nothing in Stoic doctrine
that precludes the use of medicine when appropriate), but also by way of your
own mental attitude. No wonder Epictetus is often associated with the phrase
“bear and forbear,” or “endure and renounce.” But remember that the goal isn’t
to live an unhappy and grim life. On the contrary, it is to achieve what the Stoics
called apatheia, which, despite the obvious and unappealing English echo, we
have seen means tranquillity of mind, as well as equanimity toward whatever life
happens to throw at us.
Here again, perhaps a personal anecdote will help. Not long ago I was home
alone and preparing myself dinner, engaged in slicing an onion to sauté in
preparation for a nice pasta meal. Unfortunately, the knife was rather blunt, it
slipped, and I cut my left ring finger—deeply cut, as in, I had to hold it to
prevent it from falling off. (At the moment of this writing, more than a year later,
I still haven’t completely regained sensation in that finger.) I distinctly remember
automatically switching to an attitude that I probably would not have had a few
years ago. I looked at what I had done, took the obvious precaution of holding
the partly severed digit with my other hand, and then quickly decided that it
wasn’t going to be a good idea to wipe the blood off and that I should simply get
out and walk to the nearby medical emergency facility to have them take care of
my finger as best they could. On my way there I kept engaging in premeditatio
malorum (foreseeing bad things): what was the worst thing that could happen,
and how would I deal with it? I’m no medical doctor, but as far as I could tell,
the worst-case scenario was going to involve a significant amount of pain, the
loss of a bit of blood, and possibly the permanent loss of part of the finger. Well,
that wasn’t too bad, was it? I’m not a pianist, I’m pretty fast at typing my essays
using mostly just two fingers, and such an outcome wouldn’t change my
appearance enough to create problems with my dating life. I could cope with it, I
decided. And I did. Then things turned out significantly better than my
premeditatio scenario allowed: I still have the full finger, and I even use it
occasionally to help with the typing. My romantic life wasn’t affected either, I’m
happy to report.
5. Pause and take a deep breath. “Remember, it is not enough to be hit or
insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone

succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the
provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to
impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it is easier to
maintain control.”
As we have seen, Stoics handled insults very well, ideally like rocks. (Have
you ever tried to insult a rock? How did it go?) Those who felt so inclined also
responded with a sense of humor. The point here, however, is to practice the
crucial step that allows us to more rationally examine our impressions,
regardless of whether they are negative, such as insults, or positive such as
feelings of lust: we need to resist the impulse to react immediately and
instinctively to potentially problematic situations. Instead, we must pause, take a
deep breath, perhaps go for a walk around the block, and only then consider the
issue as dispassionately (in the sense of equanimity, not lack of care) as possible.
This is simple advice, and yet it is very difficult to pull off. It is also very, very
important. Once you start seriously practicing this exercise, you will see
dramatic improvements in the way you handle things, and you’ll get positive
feedback from all the others who also see those improvements. I cannot even
count, at this point, the number of occasions when doing what Epictetus says
here saved a situation in my life and improved my mood.
You know the famous Nike commercial slogan, “Just Do It”? Well no, the
Stoics disagree. If it is important, you really ought to stop and think about it
before you decide whether to do it. Imagine how much less pain you would have
inflicted on others, how many difficult or embarrassing situations you would
have avoided, and just generally how much more self-confident and positive you
would have felt if you had started doing this years ago. As our friend Epictetus
puts it, “[The next time] you encounter anything troublesome or pleasant or
glorious or inglorious, remember that the hour of struggle is come, the Olympic
contest is here and you may put it off no longer, and that one day and one action
determines whether the progress you have achieved is lost or maintained.” The
Olympic games of life have already started, and even if you did not join before,
the time to join is now, not tomorrow.
6. Other-ize. “We can familiarize ourselves with the will of nature by calling
to mind our common experiences. When a friend breaks a glass, we are quick to
say, ‘Oh, bad luck.’ It’s only reasonable, then, that when a glass of your own
breaks, you accept it in the same patient spirit. Moving on to graver things: when
somebody’s wife or child dies, to a man we all routinely say, ‘Well, that’s part of
life.’ But if one of our own family is involved, then right away it’s ‘Poor, poor

me!’ We would do better to remember how we react when a similar loss afflicts
others.”
This exercise is a fascinating one: Epictetus reminds us here of just how
differently we regard an event that has affected other people when the same
event affects us. Naturally, it is far easier to maintain equanimity (which, again,
is not to be confused with emotional impassivity!) when little inconveniences, or
even disasters, happen to others rather than to ourselves. But why, really? What
makes us think that we are the universe’s special darlings, or that we ought to
be?
Of course, even if we can bring ourselves to realize and internalize (which is
far more difficult) that we are just like everyone else on the planet and should
have the same attitude about an occurrence when it happens to others as when it
happens to ourselves, we could still flip the argument on the Stoic and say that
the right thing to do is to feel the same degree of pain and empathy for
everyone’s misfortunes as we do for our own. The Stoic has two responses to
this argument—one based on empirical evidence, and the other from
philosophical principles. The empirical fact is that human beings are simply
incapable, physiologically, of that much empathy. To feel truly sorry and
distraught for every life lost on planet Earth as we normally feel when our own
loved ones die is, simply put, inhuman. The philosophical argument is that we
are, if not entirely right, at least closer to the truth when we say to other people,
“I’m truly sorry, but it is a fact of life,” than when we tell ourselves, “Poor me!
Poor me!” Accidents, injuries, disease, and death are unavoidable, and while it is
understandable to be distraught over them (presumably in proportion to their
gravity—breaking a glass is not the same thing as losing one’s spouse!), we can
take comfort in knowing that they are in the normal order of things. The universe
isn’t after anyone—or at least, it isn’t after any one of us in particular!
I found both interpretations of the “other-ize” exercise useful in a number of
recent experiences. Sometimes I tend to dismiss the feelings of people who are
close to me on the grounds that they are overreacting to whatever is happening to
them. But Epictetus reminds me that I tend to feel differently when similar
things—like a cutting comment from a friend or a colleague—happen to me. By
the same token, when it is my turn to be on the receiving end, I now instantly
recall that pretty much everyone I know has experienced whatever it is that is
upsetting me at the moment, or will experience it at some point in their lives.
This constant habit of adjusting my own reactions to others’ misfortunes and
putting my problems in context by remembering that they are common to the

broader humanity is—I think—gradually helping me see things with an
equanimity that I definitely lacked before I got interested in Stoicism.
7. Speak little and well. “Let silence be your goal for the most part; say only
what is necessary, and be brief about it. On the rare occasions when you’re
called upon to speak, then speak, but never about banalities like gladiators,
horses, sports, food and drink—common-place stuff. Above all don’t gossip
about people, praising, blaming or comparing them.”
I must admit that this is a hard one for me to practice, probably owing to my
somewhat above-average ego and the professional habits of a teacher who is far
too often in professorial mode. Still, I’ve tried to remember this counsel and take
it to heart, and it is serving me increasingly well. Very few people wish to be
lectured over dinner or on a social occasion. Come to think of it, probably very
few people want to be lectured under any circumstances at all! So one side effect
of this exercise is that it will probably make you more welcomed regardless of
the occasion.
On closer inspection, Epictetus’s list of things not to talk about is revealing in
and of itself. We may not talk much these days about gladiators, but we do talk
about star athletes, movie and music stars, and other “celebrities” (which, as a
song from the musical Chicago aptly explains, means “to be famous for being
famous”). Why should we refrain from such talk, or at least indulge in it as little
as possible? Because it is fundamentally empty. Why should we care at all about
what the Kardashians (or any other celebrities of the moment) are doing? To say
that an interest in such matters is the hallmark of a rather shallow mind sounds
elitist of course, and therefore distasteful to our modern sensibilities, but only
because we have been conditioned to think that “serious” talk is boring and at
any rate requires more background knowledge and attention than most of us
associate with good conversation. This, however, has most definitely not always
been true. Those who frequented ancient Greek symposia or their Roman
equivalent, the convivium (which means “living together”), thought that a good
dinner party hinged on involved discussions of philosophy, politics, and other
“serious” matters. To make the discussion flow better, both the Greeks and the
Romans served light wine and snacks. During the Enlightenment, private
“salons” sprang up throughout Europe, and people competed to be invited to join
in the salon conversations, with very few reports of ensuing boredom.
Epictetus’s second list—the items of conversation we should stay away from
“above all”—concerns gossip and judgments of people. This list requires some
further discussion. Gossiping probably evolved over time as a way for people to

“keep track,” so to speak, of members of their tribe, which is very helpful when
your survival depends on the trustworthiness (or not) of those around you.
Although even in modern society we need to appraise the people with whom we
interact in order to decide whether we can rely on them as life partners, friends,
business associates, coworkers, and so forth, this is probably best done directly,
in person, based on what the people in question actually say and—especially—
on what they do. To indulge in gossip and judge people who are not present to
defend themselves simply does not seem to be the virtuous thing to do, and the
Stoic idea is that we debase ourselves whenever we engage in such activity.
An important part of what Epictetus is suggesting here builds on the general
Stoic principle that we can decide on our best course of action and then redirect
our behavior accordingly. Initially, this is difficult, and even feels unnatural, but
then habit kicks in and redirecting our behavior becomes easier and easier—until
we reach the point where we wonder how we could have ever behaved
otherwise. So I don’t suggest that you suddenly and drastically change your
demeanor at social events. But give it a try and see how it fits you. Begin by
responding less and less to talk of “gladiators” and such and occasionally
introduce a more challenging topic of your own that is based on something
you’ve recently read or watched and that you feel might lead to a mutually
beneficial conversation with your friends. See what happens! I’m still surprised
at how much more I enjoy dinner parties now.
8. Choose your company well. “Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers. If
you must, though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a
companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too, no matter
how clean they started out.”
I laugh every time I read this, since it is yet another example of Stoic, shall
we say, bluntness; it is bound to shock modern sensibilities, and yet, the more I
reflect on it, the more I become convinced that modern sensibilities could benefit
from the occasional shock. Indeed, to our ears this sort of advice sounds (again!)
insufferably elitist, but only a moment’s reflection reveals that it is not. First of
all, remember the source: it comes from an ex-slave who was making a living
teaching in the open air, not from a stuffy aristocrat living in a semi-secluded
Roman version of a McMansion or a gated community. Second, realize that by
“philosophers” Epictetus doesn’t mean professional academics (trust me, you
don’t want to make a habit of socializing mostly with them), but rather people
who are interested in following virtue and cultivating their character. From the
ancient perspective, which we would do well to make our own, everyone ought

to strive to be a philosopher in this sense of the term—that is, to apply reason to
improve his own and his community’s life and well-being. Even more generally,
this is simply the sound advice that our life is short, temptation and waste are
always lurking, and so we need to pay attention to what we are doing and who
our companions are.
Again, I have tried to slowly implement this strategy in my own social
interactions—it goes very well with the previous exercise of engaging in less and
more meaningful conversation. I don’t mean simply that I have cleaned up the
roster of my Facebook “friends” (although I have done that too), but that I truly
pay attention to whom I spend my time with and why. Ideally, remember how
Aristotle (not a Stoic!) put it: we want to be with friends who are better than
ourselves, so that we can learn from them. At the very least, we want our friends
to be the sort of people who can hold up a mirror to our soul, so that we can look
into it frankly and gain a better idea of just how much work needs to be done on
it (the soul, not the mirror).
9. Respond to insults with humor. “If you learn that someone is speaking ill
of you, don’t try to defend yourself against the rumors; respond instead with,
‘Yes, and he doesn’t know the half of it, because he could have said more.’”
This is a lovely example of profound wisdom accompanied by Epictetus’s
own distinctive brand of humor: instead of getting offended by someone’s insults
(remember, what they say is not yours to control), respond with self-deprecation.
You will feel better, and your vilifier will be embarrassed, or at the least
disarmed. The already mentioned Bill Irvine has worked this advice into an art
form. He tells the story of a colleague in his department who once stopped him
in the middle of the hall to say, “I was just trying to decide whether to cite your
work in my next paper.” At first Bill was delighted, thinking that one of his own
colleagues actually appreciated his technical work (believe me, it doesn’t happen
as often as you might think, especially in philosophy departments), but the
colleague immediately went on: “Yes, but I can’t decide if what you wrote is just
misguided or downright evil.” Now, most of us would be quite offended by that
sort of comment, which may have been meant as either an “observation” without
malice (academics have a not entirely undeserved reputation for being, shall we
say, socially unaware) or in fact an intentional put-down. Rather than defend
himself from the charge and launch into a detailed, and probably useless,
explanation of why his paper was neither evil nor misguided, Bill did the Stoic
thing: he took a breath, smiled, and replied: “Well, good thing you haven’t read
my other works, or you’d see just how evil and misguided I really am.”

I’m sure the reader will have no trouble believing that this is advice that I
have also tried, if imperfectly, to put into practice. Doing so has made a
significant difference in the way I relate to others, especially hostile others. In
my younger days, I was far more insecure and prone to take offense, sometimes
brooding for hours, or even losing sleep, over what I perceived as an insult,
especially if it had come from someone I admired or regarded as a friend. No
more. Now I follow Bill and actually relish the occasions on which I receive
insults (which are fairly rare, I must say).
The best arena to practice what he calls “insult pacifism” is, of course, the
Internet. I maintain an active set of social networks for professional and outreach
work, not to mention two blogs, and as I’m sure is common experience, that
provides highly fertile ground for trolling, grandstanding, and general rudeness. I
therefore had to set ground rules for my readers and followers—as well as for
myself—very early on in the game, before I got interested in Stoicism. Since
then, meeting insults with humor has most definitely made my virtual life a far
more pleasant experience. First, however, I follow Epictetus’s previous advice
about speaking little and to the point: I simply do not respond or engage as much
as I did before, while increasing the time I spend just listening. More
importantly, I have begun to internalize the concept that an insult works, not
because it is intended as such by the person who delivers it, but because the
target allows it to become an insult.
There are two important caveats to discuss concerning this exercise. First and
foremost, this shouldn’t be taken as a backhanded way to ignore the serious
problem of bullying, of both the cyber and in-person varieties. Bullying is a
behavior that is not acceptable and ought to be nipped in the bud, especially
when aimed—as it often is—at minors or at people who suffer from
psychological issues that make them particularly susceptible to it. But this is true
in general of a lot of what the Stoics advise: the two approaches—working on
eliminating or curtailing a problem while at the same time developing one’s own
endurance—are simply not mutually exclusive. As a matter of fact, not only is
there no need to choose one strategy or the other, but they can be reciprocally
reinforcing. The more you train yourself to endure insults the stronger you feel
psychologically, and therefore the more you can react appropriately and
effectively, and vice versa: taking a stance against bullying enables you to see it
for the infantile attitude that it really is (even, or especially, when engaged in by
“adults”), and this insight then leads to the fostering of greater resilience.
The second caveat stems from an objection I often hear whenever this

particular Stoic advice is discussed: perhaps, the argument goes, what you
perceive as an insult is only meant as a criticism, even a constructive one. By
ignoring it or not taking it seriously, you may miss out on a chance at selfimprovement and even come across as arrogant.
In response, we have to remember that one of the four cardinal Stoic virtues
is wisdom, the practice of which makes it easier for us to distinguish criticism
from insult. Often the distinction is so clear that you don’t have to be a Sage to
see it. Even so, it is always worth asking yourself a number of questions when
you are on the receiving end of what feels like an insult. Is this person a friend or
someone you look up to? If yes, then it is more likely that she is just offering
advice, perhaps in a somewhat pointed fashion, but with good intentions
nonetheless. Even if the person is not likely to be friendly or particularly well
positioned to provide you with constructive and useful counsel, perhaps she is
seeing something that you don’t? In that case too, it is worth ignoring the cutting
aspect of what she is saying in order to focus on what it is that she may have
gotten right and that may have eluded you. There is no reason at all why insults,
even when meant as such, cannot also be teaching moments for us.
10. Don’t speak too much about yourself. “In your conversation, don’t
dwell at excessive length on your own deeds or adventures. Just because you
enjoy recounting your exploits doesn’t mean that others derive the same pleasure
from hearing about them.”
I must admit to often failing to follow this advice (see “ego” and
“professorial mode” above), but I keep trying. When I do succeed at it, however,
not only do I feel good, but I enjoy my social life more. It feels good because, as
we have seen with a number of the other exercises—and indeed as the Stoics
themselves clearly recognized—there is a peculiar pleasure in being able to
exercise some self-control. I can perhaps explain better by making an analogy to
going to the gym. I don’t know about you, but when I get to my local gym and
someone from behind the reception desk smiles and greets me with a loud and
cheerful, “Enjoy your workout!” the first thought that comes to my mind is: Who
on earth enjoys working out? Yes, I know, some people actually do enjoy it, but
most of us don’t. And yet, it is the sort of thing we do because we have reflected
on the benefits of doing it and decided that the gain is worth the pain, as they
say. But it is also the case that once we get to the end of the workout and head to
the shower, we feel a peculiar sort of satisfaction, not only from the
physiological benefits of the exercise but also from being able to pat ourselves
on the back and say: it was hard, we didn’t really want to do it, but we did it!

As for the positive social benefits of this particular spiritual exercise, I think
they are obvious: just as no one wants to sit through a slide show from your
latest vacation (even when presented as tiny pictures on your latest shining
iPhone), no one really wants to hear another person going on and on about
himself. It is pretty safe to say that we are not as interesting as we think we are.
So trust me (and Epictetus): being a bit more cognizant of that basic truth of
social interaction and trying a little harder to take it into account will only make
your friends and acquaintances happier.
11. Speak without judging. “Someone bathes in haste; don’t say he bathes
badly, but in haste. Someone drinks a lot of wine; don’t say he drinks badly, but
a lot. Until you know their reasons, how do you know that their actions are
vicious? This will save you from perceiving one thing clearly, but then assenting
to something different.”
I’m still working on this one too, I’m afraid. But again, Epictetus’s advice is
so useful, and so typically Stoic. The idea is to distinguish between matters of
fact—to which we can assent if we find them justified by observation—and
judgments, from which we generally ought to abstain, since we usually don’t
have sufficient information.
As we all know, pretty much every day presents us with countless occasions
to practice this exercise. Has a friend of yours let himself go in terms of physical
appearance? Try to simply describe the fact to yourself, rather than construct a
judgment. Then ask yourself why that might have happened. Did your friend
want to become less attractive or physically fit? Probably not. What were the
deeper causes then? And rather than judging the outcome, can you help him
instead of sitting there and criticizing him? Or perhaps a coworker has snapped
at you, or at someone else. Rather than hurling (or mumbling to yourself) what
you think might be an “appropriate” epithet, ask yourself: Have I ever snapped at
anyone? Yes of course. And when I did so, was it really enjoyable to treat
someone like crap? Or were there deeper and not very obvious reasons why I
snapped against my better judgment? And how would I have liked others to
regard my outburst—what would I have wanted them to do about it? Now make
an effort to reverse the situation and see if you can practice Epictetus’s advice in
the presence of your irritable coworker.
Just pause for a moment and try to imagine how much better the world would
be if we all refrained from hasty judgments and looked at human affairs matterof-factly, with a bit more compassion for our fellow human beings.
12. Reflect on your day. “Admit not sleep into your tender eyelids till you

have reckoned up each deed of the day—How have I erred, what done or left
undone? So start, and so review your acts, and then for vile deeds chide yourself,
for good be glad.”
This last exercise comes from the Discourses, not the Enchiridion (and in
fact, we have already encountered it), but I think it is crucial and include it here
because I have found it extremely beneficial myself. Seneca advises us to do
something very similar, and he specifically says that it is best to do it in the
evening but before going to bed, because when we are already in bed we tend to
become groggy and lose concentration. Find a quiet place in your house or
apartment (I can manage that even in the minimalist spaces most people can
afford in New York!) and reflect on what has happened during the day. I find it
useful to write down my reflections, as Marcus Aurelius did with his
“meditations.”
The goal is to focus on the important happenings of the day, particularly
those that have ethical valence. Perhaps I had a bruising interaction with a
colleague today, or didn’t treat my partner as well as I should have. Then again,
maybe I was magnanimous to a student, or helpful to a friend. For each of these
types of occurrences, I write a couple of lines in my philosophical diary, add as
dispassionate a comment as I can muster—as if I were grading my own ethical
performance that day—and make a mental note of what I have learned from my
experiences. On this point I honestly can do no better than to give you a small
taste of Seneca himself, arguably the most compelling and elegant of the Stoic
writers:
The spirit ought to be brought up for examination daily. It was the custom
of Sextius when the day was over, and he had betaken himself to rest, to
inquire of his spirit: “What bad habit of yours have you cured to-day?
What vice have you checked? In what respect are you better?” Anger will
cease, and become more gentle, if it knows that every day it will have to
appear before the judgment seat. What can be more admirable than this
fashion of discussing the whole of the day’s events? How sweet is the
sleep which follows this self-examination? How calm, how sound, and
careless is it when our spirit has either received praise or reprimand, and
when our secret inquisitor and censor has made his report about our
morals? I make use of this privilege, and daily plead my cause before
myself: when the lamp is taken out of my sight, and my wife, who knows
my habit, has ceased to talk, I pass the whole day in review before myself,

and repeat all that I have said and done: I conceal nothing from myself,
and omit nothing: for why should I be afraid of any of my shortcomings,
when it is in my power to say, “I pardon you this time: see that you never
do that anymore”?… A good man delights in receiving advice: all the
worst men are the most impatient of guidance.

APPENDIX

THE HELLENISTIC SCHOOLS OF PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY

Wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder.
—PLATO, THEAETETUS, 155

THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ETHICS, specifically from the
point of view of the Stoics. Ethics, of course, is one of the classical branches of
philosophy, the other ones being aesthetics (concerned with beauty and art),
epistemology (the study of how we know things), logic (dedicated to
understanding reason), and metaphysics (to comprehend the nature of the world).
But as we saw at the beginning of the book, “ethics” has a different meaning
today than it did for the ancient Greco-Romans, and of course the Stoics’ wasn’t
the only approach to its study. While modern ethics is essentially concerned with
which actions are right or wrong, premodern philosophers conceived of ethics as
the much broader inquiry into how to live a happy life, the pursuit of which they
deemed to be a human being’s most important endeavor. But a happy life can be
pursued in different ways, depending on which concept of eudaimonia—the
flourishing life—one adopts. The major Hellenistic schools of philosophy
differed primarily on just this point, and it is useful to get a sense of what the
alternatives to Stoicism were—and still are. After all, together with A Guide to
the Good Life’s author Bill Irvine, I believe that adopting and adapting a
philosophy of life to guide you is more important than whichever specific
philosophy you end up choosing.
True, there are some pretty awful “philosophies” out there that are not
conducive to human flourishing. But there are also several alternatives that may
make more sense to you personally—I don’t want to leave you with the incorrect
impression that it’s Stoicism or bust! I will not discuss the variety of life
philosophies that arose within the Eastern tradition—Buddhism, Taoism,
Confucianism, and the like—because I simply don’t know enough about them,

and because there are already plenty of excellent resources out there that the
interested reader can make use of. Here it will be instructive to take a quick look
at those that came out of the Western tradition in the Hellenistic period, before
the rise of Christianity. What follows is a simplified genealogical tree of the
major Hellenistic schools that either focused on or had a lot to say about the
good life.
As you can see, it all began with Socrates. Stemming from different
interpretations of his teachings, a trio of schools arose: Plato’s Academy,
Aristippus’s Cyrenaics, and Antisthenes’s Cynicism. Aristotelianism originated
from within the Academy (which Aristotle frequented), Cyrenaism led to
Epicureanism, and Cynicism birthed Stoicism—although the actual relationships
among all these schools are best thought of as many-to-many rather than in
terms of linear descent, given the reciprocal influences that took place over
centuries. Let’s take a brief look at each—who knows, it may turn out that after
having learned this much about Stoicism you are really a Cynic or, Zeus forbid,
an Epicurean!

FIGURE A.1. The historical and conceptual
relationships among the main Hellenistic
schools of philosophy and how they
diverged from the thinking of Socrates.
Source: After Figure 1 in Gordon,
“Modern Morality and Ancient Ethics,”
Internet Encycopedia of Philosophy.

Socraticism: We know what Socrates taught mostly (though not exclusively)
from the early Platonic dialogues (for example, Laches, Charmides, and
Protagoras). His was the prototype of the ethical approaches to virtue in which

wisdom is the Chief Good, the only thing that is always good because it is
necessary to make proper use of everything else. For Socrates, our moral
imperative is to examine our life, and reason is our best guide in doing so. The
eudaimonic life, according to him, consists in acting in the right way, and evil is
the result of ignorance, or amathia (in other words, nobody purposefully wants
to do bad things).
Platonism (the Academy): Plato, in the later dialogues, maintained crucial
aspects of Socrates’s view (critically, that the eudaimonic life is one of practicing
virtue), while at the same time adding a number of metaphysical notions and
recasting things in terms of his famous theory of Forms, where the abstract and
idealized Form of the Good is the transcendent principle of all goodness. He
eventually subordinated individual flourishing to societal needs, as in the
Republic, where the ideal state reflects the tripartite division of the human soul,
and philosophers, naturally, are in charge of it—just as reason is in charge of the
“spirited” and “appetitive” parts of the individual soul.
Aristotelianism (the Peripatetic school, the Lyceum): For Aristotle too, the
point of life was to achieve eudaimonia through the practice of the virtues (of
which he identified a whopping twelve). In Aristotle’s view, there is a proper
function for everything in the world, including humans: our proper function is to
use reason, so using reason well is the way to live a eudaimonic life. However,
we also need some external goods, such as a supportive family and societal
environment, some degree of education, health, and wealth, and even some good
looks. Crucially, then, being able to live a eudaimonic life is not entirely within
the grasp of the agent: some luck, in the form of favorable circumstances, is also
needed.
Cyrenaism: Aristippus of Cyrene was, tellingly enough, the first of Socrates’s
disciples to actually take money for his services. For him, the primary purpose of
life was not long-term happiness but rather the moment-to-moment experience
of bodily pleasures. To achieve this, one needs practical virtue, but only
instrumentally, in order to seek pleasure. Still, we shouldn’t think of the
Cyrenaics as simply being into sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll, but rather as seeking
what might be called enlightened hedonism. As Aristippus put it: “I possess, but
I am not possessed.” Self-control was important in order to maintain
cheerfulness while making the best of every situation.
Epicureanism (the Garden): Epicurus too taught that life is about increasing
one’s pleasure and (especially) reducing one’s pain. But Epicurean hedonism
was much more sophisticated than its Cyrenaic counterpart (despite later

Christian smearing, deployed in a successful attempt to fight a threatening rival
sect). For one thing, it included mental pleasures, which were considered
superior to bodily ones, and happiness was not just a moment-by-moment thing
but a lifelong process. The Epicurean way included freeing oneself from
prejudice (especially of a religious nature), mastering one’s desires, living a
modest life, and cultivating friendship. Crucially, however, Epicureans counseled
withdrawal from social and political life (because it was much more likely to
bring about pain than pleasure).
Cynicism: According to Antisthenes of Athens, the founder of the Cynic
school, virtue understood as practical wisdom is not only necessary for a
eudaimonic life but also sufficient. That is why the Cynics took the already
rather frugal Socratic lifestyle to an extreme. Think of Diogenes of Sinope,
Antisthenes’s student, who famously lived in a tub, begged for a living, and
flaunted just about any social convention. Many Stoics admired the Cynics, and
our friend Epictetus devoted the long chapter 22 of the third book of his
Discourses to an encomium of Cynicism. As he put it, if you really can’t be a
Cynic, at least be a Stoic.
Stoicism: Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, learned his philosophy
initially from Crates, who was a Cynic and disciple of Diogenes of Sinope. As
the reader by now knows well, Stoicism struck a middle ground between
Aristotelianism and Cynicism, while at the same time strongly rejecting
Epicureanism. The Stoics granted to the Cynics that virtue is both necessary and
sufficient for happiness, but also nodded toward the Peripatetics in recovering
(some) interest in external goods, which they classified into preferred and
dispreferred indifferents, to be pursued, or avoided, so long as they do not
compromise one’s integrity of character.
All in all, there was a nice conceptual progression and ramification from the
Socratic starting point: the Platonic/Aristotelian branch stuck close to Socratic
eudaimonism, but the Platonists went mystical (the theory of Forms, the ideal
Republic), while the Aristotelians turned pragmatic (some external goods are
necessary to achieve eudaimonia). The Cyrenaic/Epicurean branch abandoned
the centrality of virtue and turned toward the pleasure-pain dichotomy instead,
with the crucial difference that the Cyrenaics considered only bodily moment-tomoment pleasures, while the Epicureans most valued intellectual and lifelong
pleasures. (Echoes of their philosophy can be heard in John Stuart Mill and
modern utilitarian ethics.) Finally, the Cynic/Stoic branch stuck with the Socratic
primacy of virtue, with the Cynics turning to an ascetic lifestyle and the Stoics

elaborating a way to recover (and yet put into perspective) what most people
would consider desirable externals. Both of these schools were highly influential
throughout the history of Christianity.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
THIS BOOK IS THE RESULT OF A PERSONAL SPIRITUAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, and intellectual
journey that began many years ago and has taken many twists and turns. And
I’m sure this won’t be the end point either. Many people have directly or
indirectly contributed to my journey, and I would like to acknowledge a few of
them: Enrica Chiaromonte, my high school philosophy teacher, who instilled in
me a passion for the subject that took a quarter-century to finally blossom;
Melissa Brenneman, for her support when I made the crazy decision to change
careers and become a philosopher; Corinna Colatore, for being there since the
beginning of my journey into Stoicism and bearing with my daily practice, no
matter how inconvenient it may become at times; my colleagues at the City
College of New York, for their support of my idiosyncratic approach to our
discipline; the many people behind Stoic Week and STOICON, through whom I
discovered Stoicism, and who have welcomed and helped me throughout; my
fellow Stoic (and Buddhist) Greg Lopez, who has taught me much about
Epictetus, Marcus, and Seneca; Tisse Takagi, my agent, who has been
enthusiastic about this project since the beginning and an invaluable guide
throughout; T. J. Kelleher, my editor at Basic Books, whose professionalism
keeps striking me every time we work together; and my very careful copyeditor,
Cindy Buck.

ADVANCE PRAISE FOR

HOW TO BE A STOIC

“This is a lucid, engaging, and persuasive book about what it means to pursue
Stoic ideals in the here and now. Massimo Pigliucci’s imaginary conversations
with Epictetus carry the reader effortlessly along while grounding the discussion
firmly in the ancient Stoic tradition—and in his own life experience. The result
is a compelling picture of a Stoic way of life that is consistent with
contemporary science and philosophy, and is both eminently ethical and downto-earth practical. It will be inviting to Stoics and non-Stoics alike who are
willing to reason together seriously about how (and why) to be a modern Stoic.”
—Lawrence C. Becker, author of A New Stoicism

“If you want to learn the ways of Stoicism, and you’re living in the twenty-first
century, this should be one of the first books you read. Massimo has written a
fine primer for the aspiring Marcus Aurelius.”
—Donald J. Robertson, author of The Philosophy of CBT and Stoicism and the Art of Happiness

NOTES

CHAPTER 1: THE UNSTRAIGHTFORWARD PATH
“At this point you run the risk”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.12. The full text
of Epictetus’s Discourses is at:

Handbook), written in 135 CE and translated by Elizabeth Carter, can be
found at: http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html.
“Death is necessary”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.27.
“We die every day”: Seneca, “Letter 24: On Despising Death,” in Seneca the
Younger, Complete Works (Delphi Classics, 2014), 19.
“A man cannot live well”: Seneca, “On Tranquility of Mind,” 11.

and Gary Emery, Cognitive Therapy of Depression (New York: Guilford
Press, 1987), 8.
the clear dichotomy the Stoics drew: William Irvine, A Guide to the Good
Life (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008).
this knowledge reinforces the idea: To clarify what I mean with an example,
cognitive scientists have also demonstrated time and again that human
beings are bad at estimating probabilities, a fact notoriously exploited by the
gambling and lottery industries. But nobody would take those findings as a
reason to eliminate the study of statistics; on the contrary, it is precisely such
study that can immunize people, at least in part, against common (and
sometimes ruinous!) mistakes in quantitative reasoning.
“Men who have made these discoveries”: Seneca, “Letter 33: On the Futility
of Learning Maxims,” 11.
one of the most renowned teachers in Rome: Not much remains of
Musonius’s writings, but they have been collected in an excellent recent

translation by Cynthia King, Musonius Rufus: Lectures and Sayings, edited
and with a preface by William B. Irvine (William B. Irvine, 2011).
arguably the most famous Stoic of all time: Marcus’s Meditations, a
philosophical diary of personal reflection not originally meant for
publication, is one of the most popular books of all time. Like Epictetus’s
Discourses, it has been continuously in print. For a full version, see The
Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, written in 167 CE and translated by George
Long, available at: http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html.

who was a long-distance runner: Both physical jobs and practicing sports
often figure in ancient Greco-Roman philosophy. Cleanthes, the second
head of the Stoa, was a pugilist and made a living drawing water from
gardens.

Marcus Aurelius (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998).

CHAPTER 3: SOME THINGS ARE IN OUR POWER, OTHERS ARE NOT
“And they said”: Solomon ibn Gabirol, A Choice of Pearls (New York: Bloch
Publishing Co., 1925), chap. 17, verse 2.

Publications, 2008), chap. 6, verse 10.
“Make the best use”: Epictetus, Enchiridion, I.1.
“We act very much as if”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.5, I.1.

“News was brought him”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.1.
“What then is the proper training”: Ibid., III.24.

CHAPTER 4: LIVING ACCORDING TO NATURE
“It is no ordinary task”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.9.
We are not the only animals: Frans de Waal, Primates and Philosophers:
How Morality Evolved (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009).
the largest brain-to-body ratio: On the lack of a bone in the human penis and
other oddities, see Robert D. Martin, “The Evolution of Human
Reproduction: A Primatological Perspective,” supplement, American
Journal of Physical Anthropology 134, no. S45 (2007): 59–84.
what exactly constitutes a language: On the uniqueness of human language
and related topics, see Chet C. Sherwood, Francys Subiaul, and Tadeusz W.
Zawidzki, “A Natural History of the Human Mind: Tracing Evolutionary
Changes in Brain and Cognition,” Journal of Anatomy 212 (2008): 426–
454.
Some of these shared traits: A complete list of human universals (always
subject to debate and refinement, of course) is found in Donald Brown,
Human Universals (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1991).
“See that you do not act like a sheep”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.9.
“In every system of morality”: David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature
(London: John Noon, 1739), 335.
ethics has to come from somewhere: Even today most people still think that
the obvious source of morality is a god, but that proposition—which is of
course distinct from the question of whether or not a god (or gods) exist—
was decidedly refuted 2,400 years ago by none other than Socrates, a big
influence on the Stoics. See, for instance, chapter 18 of my Answers for
Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to a More Meaningful
Life (New York: Basic Books, 2013).
known as a category mistake: The concept of a category mistake may perhaps
best be understood with the classic example given in intro philosophy
classes: If you ask, “What is the color of triangles?” it may seem that you
are asking a deep question, but in fact you are applying a category (color) to
a concept (triangles) that the category simply does not belong to. Triangles,
as abstract geometrical figures, are described in terms of angles, sizes, and
so forth, but not in terms of color—although of course a particular triangle

may have a certain color. Still, you may fool someone for a few seconds at a
cocktail party with that sort of question. Just make sure to quickly move
away before your interlocutor has had time to think about it for a few
seconds.
we do indeed have a moral instinct: For an accessible piece on the concept of
the moral instinct, see Stephen Pinker, “The Moral Instinct,” New York
Times Magazine, January 13, 2008.
as we approach the age of reason: The so-called five- to seven-year shift (or
six- to eight- ), intuited by the ancients, is now a well-established scientific
concept, backed by solid evidence from both psychology and neuroscience.
See, for instance, Arnold J. Sameroff and Marshall M. Haith, The Five to
Seven Year Shift: The Age of Reason and Responsibility (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1996).
“the nature of the rational animal”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.19.
“Each of us is, as it were”: Ethical Fragments of Hierocles, Preserved by
Stobaeus, translated by Thomas Taylor (1822). See the fragment “How we
ought to conduct ourselves towards our kindred.”
“Never… reply to one”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.9.

CHAPTER 5: PLAYING BALL WITH SOCRATES
“[Socrates] was like one playing”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.5.
Greco-Roman soccer: There is pretty good evidence that both the Greeks and
the Romans played some kind of soccer, though the rules of the game have
not survived. The National Museum of Archaeology in Athens houses a
marble relief featuring an adult and a child, with the adult clearly balancing
what the Romans called a folis, which looks like a soccer ball (that is, an
inflated ball). Moreover, Ulpiano tells of a court case in Rome over a man
who was getting a shave in a barber shop being killed by a flying soccer ball
of the pile type, which was characterized by stitches very much like those of
modern soccer balls. See Digesto, IX, 2, 11, pr. 1.
making the obstacle the way: “Our actions may be impeded by [others], but
there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can
accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes
the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What
stands in the way becomes the way.” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, V.20.
“How do I know what is going”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.5.
“I was imbued with”: Seneca, Epistles, 108, 22.
“although there are many pleasures”: Musonius Rufus, “The Lecture About
Food,” Lectures, part B, 3, 7, and 8, in Musonius Rufus, Lectures and
Sayings, translated by Cynthia King (CreateSpace, 2011).
there really are only two options: Many so-called informal logical fallacies
are actually not fallacious at all, or at least not always. Often they are simple
heuristics—shortcuts one can use in a pinch to arrive at a satisfactory
understanding of a situation, or a preliminary judgment. Hurling accusations
of logical fallacies is a particularly common practice in discussions of
pseudoscientific claims, as my colleagues and I have argued in this paper:
Maarten Boudry, Fabio Paglieri, and Massimo Pigliucci, “The Fake, the
Flimsy, and the Fallacious: Demarcating Arguments in Real Life,”
Argumentation 29 (2015): 431–456.
Eleven Madison Park: Curious about why I picked on Eleven Madison Park?
Because of this article (Edward Frame, “Dinner and Deception,” New York
Times, August 22, 2015) by one of their former “captains,” which provides a

behind-the-scenes look at the culture of service there and the customers who
use it and abuse it. I should add that I very much doubt that Eleven Madison
Park is special in this respect.
“If [you] must live in a palace”: Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, V.16.
Diogenes seriously practiced: Much of what we know of the life and
adventures of Diogenes the Cynic comes from another Diogenes, Laertius,
in his Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers.
“great difference between joy and pain”: Seneca, On Various Aspects of
Virtue, 18.
the concept of lexicographic preferences: I must thank one of the readers of
my howtobeastoic.org blog, who goes by the handle “timbartik,” for
pointing me in the direction of lexicographic ordering as a good model of
the distinction between virtue and preferred indifferents.
standard economic theory simply does not apply: A number of philosophers
have implicitly used lexicographic ordering when making the case that a
particular good should not be for sale; see, for instance, Michael J. Sandel,
What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets (New York: Farrar,
Straus & Giroux, 2012), and Debra Satz, Why Some Things Should Not Be
for Sale: The Moral Limits of Markets (New York: Oxford University Press,
2010).

CHAPTER 6: GOD OR ATOMS?
“Who is it that has fitted the sword”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.6.
such as Thomas Aquinas: Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae (1273),
Article 3, Question 2.
“In crossing a heath”: William Paley, Natural Theology: or, Evidence of the
Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearance of
Nature (London: J. Faulder, 1802), ch. 1.
“If we see a house”: David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion
(1779), part II.
“But I own that I cannot see”: Charles Darwin (1903), More Letters of
Charles Darwin, edited by Francis Darwin and A. C. Seward (New York: D.
Appleton and Co., 1903), 252. See also Sara Joan Miles, “Charles Darwin
and Asa Gray Discuss Teleology and Design,” Perspectives on Science and
Christian Faith 53 (September 2001): 196–201, available at:
http://goo.gl/kbdNR5.
“Slave, do you mean to arraign”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.12. A position very
close to Epictetus’s has recently been articulated and defended with modern
arguments by the philosopher Tim Mulgan in his Purpose in the Universe:
The Moral and Metaphysical Case for Ananthropocentric Purposivism
(New York: Oxford University Press, 2015).
“You are a principal work”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.8.
or perhaps panentheistic: There is a subtle but important distinction between
pantheism and panentheism: in the first case, God is identical to Nature; in
the second, God interpenetrates Nature (that is, God is everywhere), but
there is a distinction between God and Nature nonetheless. What makes the
Stoic case a bit difficult to decide is that, on the one hand, they used the
terms “God” (or “Zeus,” but not referring to the Olympian version) and
“Nature” interchangeably. But they also believed that the universe is made
of matter, some of which (all living beings, including humans) also partakes
of the rational principle, the Logos. So their metaphysics really had
elements of both pantheism and panentheism—not that it really matters for
my purposes here.
“Concerning the gods”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.12. For “where’er I move /

Thou seest me,” see Homer, Iliad, X.279.
“That which is true is mine”: Seneca, Epistles, I.12.11.
“To the gods I am indebted”: Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, I.17.
“Since it is possible”: Ibid., II.11.
“You have embarked”: Ibid., III.3.
“Either there is a fatal necessity”: Ibid., XII.14.
even before New Atheism: For my, shall we say, more mature take on the New
Atheism, see: “New Atheism and the Scientistic Turn in the Atheism
Movement,” Midwest Studies in Philosophy 37, no. 1 (2015): 142–153,
available at: http://philpapers.org/rec/PIGNAA.
When I was living in Tennessee: For a taste of my debates, if you are so
inclined, see “Dr. Massimo Pigliucci vs. Kent Hovind [a creationist],”

“There are many questions in philosophy”: Cicero, The Nature of the Gods,
in Complete Works of Cicero (Delphi Ancient Classics, 2014).

CHAPTER 7: IT’S ALL ABOUT CHARACTER (AND VIRTUE)
“When Vespasian sent to him”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.2.
the only human ability: A thorough discussion of Socrates’s take on wisdom
as the chief good is found in the Platonic dialogue known as the
Euthydemus. Plato, Euthydemus, translated by G. A. McBryer and M. P.
Nichols, introduction by D. Schaeffer (Focus Philosophical Library, 2010). I
published a commentary on it from a Stoic perspective, “Why Plato’s
Euthydemus Is Relevant to Stoics,” How to Be a Stoic, August 20, 2015,
available at: https://goo.gl/9K3t2a.
we must have wisdom: The ancients recognized two types of wisdom: sophia,
which refers to the ability to understand the nature of the world—the word
“philosophy” means “love” (philo) of “wisdom” (sophos)—and phron sis,
or practical wisdom, the ability to make good decisions in your life, and one
of the four Stoic virtues. Lack of sophia, as we will soon see, has its own
word, amathia, which leads to moral error regardless of your intelligence
and education. Being smart and cultured, in other words, is no assurance of
being wise.

an Athenian general and politician: Alcibiades is a wonderfully interesting
historical figure about whom—surprisingly—nobody seems to have written
a biography or made a movie. They ought to. He began the Peloponnesian
War on the side of Athens, his native city. He was eventually exiled and
defected to Sparta, for whom he engineered a number of defeats of Athens.
Then he became unpopular in Sparta as well, so he defected to Persia, the
sworn enemy of the Greek city-states. He was then recalled by Athens,
where he engineered what turned out to be the disastrous invasion of Sicily,
arguably a major reason why Athens eventually lost the war. But it could
have gone otherwise had Alcibiades actually been able to lead the expedition
as planned. Instead, his fellow citizens exiled him again and gave command
to the inept Nicias. Alcibiades then fled once more, this time to Phrygia,
where he sought help to fight Sparta. He was probably killed by Spartan
agents in the mountains of Phrygia.
“But if you are bewildered”: Alcibiades Major, 118a–c, in Plato in Twelve

modern cognitive science clearly shows: For a few examples of studies
showing that “consumer paralysis” results from having too many choices,
see Hazel Rose Markus and Barry Schwartz, “Does Choice Mean Freedom
and Well-being?” Journal of Consumer Research 37 (2010): 344–355; Tina
Harrison, Kathryn Waite, and Phil White, “Analysis by Paralysis: The
Pension Purchase Decision Process,” International Journal of Bank
Marketing 24 (2006): 5–23; and Graeme Drummond, “Consumer
Confusion: Reduction Strategies in Higher Education,” International
Journal of Educational Management 18 (2006): 317–323.

Depression,” Stoicism Today, September 19, 2015, http://goo.gl/sIGWuR.
what it is like to be another person: As it turns out, “what is it like to be [not
you]” is one of those impossible philosophical problems; see Thomas Nagel,
“What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” Philosophical Review 83, no. 4 (October
1974): 435–450, http://goo.gl/PjZSeM.

Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy (New York: Oxford University
Press, 2008), 254.
“Stand by a stone”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.25.
I don’t even know the name: See “Stoicism as a Means to Cope with Autism,”
Stoicism Today, April 26, 2015, http://goo.gl/YOQBfM. I do not have space
here to discuss several more modern Stoics I’m aware of whose approaches
to personal, nontrivial problems in life provide additional examples of the
power of this philosophy; see Leonidas Konstantakos, “On Epictetus and
Post-Traumatic Stress,” Stoicism Today, January 30, 2016,
http://goo.gl/0xXDrl; Chris Peden, “Autism and Stoicism I,” Stoicism
Today, April 25, 2015, http://goo.gl/0gXOyV (written from the point of view
of a parent of two autistic children); and the powerfully moving essay by
Marco Bronx, “In Praise of Chronic Pain: A Stoic Meditation,” Stoicism

“Our relations with one another”: Seneca, “On the Usefulness of Basic
Principles,” Letters to Lucilius, XCV.53.
“I do not know whether”: Seneca, “On Reformation,” Letters to Lucilius,
XXV.2.

CHAPTER 11: ON DEATH AND SUICIDE
They were aware of death: Similarly empowering notions of death are found in
other philosophies, such as Epicureanism (Stoicism’s direct rival) and
Buddhism (Stoicism’s Eastern cousin).
“Why does an as of wheat grow?”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.6.
“Will you realize once for all”: Ibid., III.26.
later figures influenced by Stoicism: The title of one of Michel de Montaigne’s
famous essays (collected in a book that gave the name to the entire modern
genre) was “That to Study Philosophy Is to Learn to Die” (1580); the full
text is available at:
https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Essays_of_Montaigne. Tellingly, it
begins: “Cicero says ‘that to study philosophy is nothing but to prepare
one’s self to die.’”
“Death, therefore”: Epicurus, “Letter to Menoeceus,”
http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html.
“You shall bear illness well”: Epictetus, Discourses, III.26.
“What do you mean”: Ibid., IV.7.
This is not the place to explain: Should you be curious, I’ve developed those
reasons in detail in Massimo Pigliucci, “Mind Uploading: A Philosophical
Counter-analysis,” in Intelligence Unbound: The Future of Uploaded and
Machine Minds, edited by Russell Blackford and Damien Broderick
(Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2014).
“Yes, those at the Mysteries”: Epictetus, Discourses, IV.1.
On the weekend of July 23 and 24, 2016: Julie Watson, “Terminally Ill Woman
Holds Party Before Ending Her Life,” Associated Press, August 11, 2016,
http://goo.gl/jqOr2A.
“If it is not to your profit”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.1.
The “open door”: Interpreting Epictetus’s “open door” as a reference to suicide
is widely accepted in ancient philosophy scholarship. See, for instance, W.
O. Stephens, “Epictetus on Fearing Death: Bugbear and Open Door Policy,”
Ancient Philosophy 34 (2014): 365–391.
“Suppose someone made the room smoke”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.25.
“For the foot (for instance)”: Ibid., II.5.

The last example is Seneca: Two recent biographies of Seneca have somewhat
different takes on his moral fiber and philosophical coherence: James
Romm, Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero (New York: Alfred
A. Knopf, 2014); and Emily Wilson, The Greatest Empire: A Life of Seneca
(New York: Oxford University Press, 2014).
“Let me describe another state”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.15.
“Stay where you are”: Ibid., I.9.

CHAPTER 12: HOW TO DEAL WITH ANGER, ANXIETY, AND
LONELINESS
Aristophanes made fun of Socrates: Plato did not appreciate Aristophanes’s
lampooning of his teacher and went so far as to partially blame the
playwright, in his dialogue Phaedo, for Socrates’s later execution by the
Athenian state. The claim is doubtful, but not entirely unjustified, according
to modern scholars.
“Yesterday I had an iron lamp”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.18 and I.29.
But our sage disagrees: Ironically, Lucian of Samosata tells us that when
Epictetus died, a friend of his got hold of a lamp that had belonged to the
philosopher and managed to sell it for the excellent price of 3,000 drachmas.
I’m pretty sure the philosopher would have disapproved.
modern psychological research: A useful article on recognizing and managing
anger from a modern psychological perspective is: American Psychological
Association, “Controlling Anger Before It Controls You,”
http://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control.aspx.
“‘What!’ you say”: Epictetus, Discourses, I.18.
approaches to reforming criminals: For three examples of prison systems that
a Stoic would endorse, see “Inside Norway’s Progressive Prison System,”
CNN, August 3, 2011,
http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/02/vbs.norwegian.prisons/;
“Progressive Prison Keeps Door Open,” This Is Finland,
http://finland.fi/life-society/progressive-prison-keeps-doors-open/; and
“Nicholas Turner and Jeremy Travis, “What We Learned from German
Prisons,” New York Times, August 6, 2015.
the early intuitions of the Stoics: APA, “Controlling Anger Before It Controls
You.”
“When I see a man”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.12.
Worse things happen at sea: I hope you know what I’m referring to. If not,
take a look at “Monty Python: Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,”
https://youtu.be/jHPOzQzk9Qo (around 2’30”) (uploaded July 28, 2006).
“We are anxious for our bit”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.13.
headlines that read: Here are the pertinent articles: Rebecca Harris, “The

Loneliness Epidemic: We’re More Connected Than Ever—But Are We
Feeling More Alone?” The Independent, March 30, 2015; Vanessa Barford,
“Is Modern Life Making Us Lonely?” BBC News Magazine, April 8, 2013;
and Janice Shaw Crouse, “The Loneliness of American Society,” The
American Spectator, May 18, 2014. A quick Google search will reveal many,
many more.
interesting discussion of loneliness: Colin Killeen, “Loneliness: An Epidemic
in Modern Society,” Journal of Advanced Nursing 28 (1998): 762–770.
“[Loneliness] is such an innate part”: Ibid., 762.
“The forlorn state is the condition”: Epictetus, Discourses, III.13.

CHAPTER 13: LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP
“I am so miserable”: This and the following quotes regarding Epictetus’s
encounter with the distraught father are from Discourses, I.11.
“But though we are capable”: Ibid., IV.5.
“We see that the carpenter”: Ibid., II.14 and I.29.
storgē, a far less frequently used word: This sense of the inevitability of storgē
explains why the word, counterintuitively, was also used to indicate some
things we have no choice but to put up with, like “loving” a tyrant.
“For where else is friendship”: Epictetus, Discourses, II.22.

CHAPTER 14: PRACTICAL SPIRITUAL EXERCISES
a number of other recent books: These very practical books on Stoicism
include William B. Irvine, A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of
Stoic Joy (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008); and Donald
Robertson, Stoicism and the Art of Happiness: Ancient Tips for Modern
Challenges (Teach Yourself, 2013).
I have gone through the Enchiridion: Many thanks to my friend, fellow Stoic,
and collaborator on many ventures, Greg Lopez, who has generously helped
me put together these exercises.
The first goal is to become mindful: Greg and I have put together a broader set
of exercises, twenty-four in total, by adding several more to this list from
Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations. For the full package, go to How to Be a
Stoic, “Collections,” https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/collections/.
In modern economic theory: As discussed in Chapter 5, lexicographic ordering
is at work when some philosophers argue that particular goods should not be
for sale; see Sandel, What Money Can’t Buy, and Satz, Why Some Things
Should Not Be for Sale.
“So make a practice”: Epictetus, Enchiridion, I.5.
“Agents are required”: Lawrence C. Becker, A New Stoicism (Princeton, NJ:
Princeton University Press, 1997), 42.
“In the case of particular things”: Epictetus, Enchiridion, III.
“Whenever planning an action”: Ibid., IV.
“For every challenge”: Ibid., X.
“bear and forbear”: Epictetus, Discourses, IV.8.
“Remember, it is not enough”: Epictetus, Enchiridion, XX.
“[The next time] you encounter”: Ibid., CI.
“We can familiarize ourselves”: Ibid., XXVI.
“Let silence be your goal”: Ibid., XXXIII.2.
“Avoid fraternizing”: Ibid., XXXIII.6.
“If you learn that someone”: Ibid., XXXIII.9.
an active set of social networks: On Twitter, https://twitter.com/mpigliucci.
two blogs: My blog on general philosophy can be found at platofootnote.org; the
one on Stoicism at howtobeastoic.org.

“In your conversation”: Epictetus, Enchiridion, XXXIII.14.
“Someone bathes in haste”: Ibid., XLV.
“Admit not sleep”: Epictetus, Aulus Gellius, Noctes Acticae, xii.19.
“The spirit ought to be brought up”: Seneca, On Anger, III.36.
APPENDIX: THE HELLENISTIC SCHOOLS OF PRACTICAL
PHILOSOPHY
a simplified genealogical tree: The diagram is adapted from John-Stewart
Gordon, “Modern Morality and Ancient Ethics,” Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/anci-mod/ (accessed May 27, 2016).
it all began with Socrates: There is a reason why the whole history of Western
philosophy is divided into pre-Socratics and whatever happened from
Socrates onward.

When I was thirteen years old, my father died. He’d developed lung cancer
in his fifties, which left him bedridden for a year before it finally killed him.
He was a humble and decent man, who encouraged me to think more
deeply about life.
I was totally unprepared for his death, and I coped with it badly. I
became angry and depressed. I’d stay out all night, playing cat and mouse
with the local cops, breaking into buildings and waiting for them to arrive
so I could run into gardens and dive over hedges and fences to lose them. I
was always in trouble, either for skipping lessons at school, arguing with
my teachers, or getting in fights with my classmates. As soon as my
sixteenth birthday came around, I was marched briskly down to the
headmaster’s office and given two choices: either leave voluntarily or be
expelled. So I left, and I was subsequently placed in a special program for
troubled kids. I felt that my life was spiraling rapidly out of control. I’d
been labeled a “write-off” by school and social services. I didn’t really see
any point trying to prove them wrong.
Each evening my father would come home from his work as a digger
driver on building sites and collapse exhausted in an armchair, hands
covered in grease and dirt. The job didn’t pay well, and he hadn’t two
pennies to rub together, but he never complained. When he was a young
man, his best friend had passed away, leaving my father a farm in his will,
to everyone’s surprise. He refused the bequest, returning the land to the
other man’s family. He used to say, “Money won’t bring you happiness,”
and he really believed that. He showed me that there are more important

things in life and that true wealth comes from being contented with
whatever you have rather than desiring to have more and more.
After my father’s funeral, my mother placed his old leather wallet on the
dining room table and told me to take it. I opened it slowly; I think my
hands were shaking but I’m not sure why. Inside there was nothing except a
badly worn scrap of paper. It turned out to be a passage he’d torn from the
Book of Exodus: “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he
said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto
you.” I was desperate to understand what on earth those words could
possibly have meant to him. My own philosophical journey began precisely
at that moment, as I stood there perplexed, with that piece of paper in my
hand.
When I learned many years later that Marcus Aurelius had lost his father
at an early age, I wondered if he’d been left searching in the same way I had
for a sense of direction. After my father’s death, I was left with religious
and philosophical questions that troubled me very deeply. I remember being
terrified of dying. I would lie in bed at night unable to sleep, trying to solve
the riddle of existence and find some consolation. It was as though I had an
itch at the back of my brain that I needed to scratch but couldn’t quite reach.
I didn’t know it at the time, but that sort of existential anxiety is a common
experience that drives people to the study of philosophy. The philosopher
Spinoza, for example, wrote:
I thus perceived that I was in a state of great peril, and I compelled myself to seek with all my
strength for a remedy, however uncertain it might be; as a sick man struggling with a deadly
disease, when he sees that death will surely be upon him unless a remedy be found, is
compelled to seek such a remedy with all his strength, inasmuch as his whole hope lies
therein.1

I took the phrase “I am that I am” to refer to the pure awareness of
existence itself, which at first seemed like something deeply mystical or
metaphysical to me: “I am the consciousness of my own existence.” It
reminded me of the famous inscription from the Delphic Oracle’s shrine:
Know Thyself. That became one of my maxims. I grew quite obsessed with
the pursuit of self-knowledge, through meditation and all forms of
contemplative exercises.

I found out later that the passage my father carried with him all those
years plays an important role in the rites of a Masonic chapter called the
“Royal Arch.” During initiation the candidate is asked, “Are you a Royal
Arch Mason?” to which he replies, “I—AM—THAT—I—AM.”
Freemasonry has a long history in Scotland, going back at least four
centuries, and it has deep roots in my hometown of Ayr. My father and
many of my friends’ fathers were members of the local lodge. Most
Freemasons are Christians, but they employ nondenominational language,
referring to God as “the Great Architect of the Universe.” According to the
legend presented in some of their texts, a set of spiritual teachings
originating with the builders of King Solomon’s temple was brought to the
West by the philosopher Pythagoras and further disseminated by Plato and
Euclid. This ancient wisdom was reputedly handed down through the
centuries by medieval Masonic lodges. They used esoteric rituals,
geometric symbols such as the square, and compasses to convey their
spiritual doctrines. Freemasonry also celebrates the four cardinal virtues of
Greek philosophy, which correspond symbolically with the four corners of
the lodge: Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance. (Wisdom, justice,
courage, and moderation, if you prefer more modern terms.) My father took
these ethical teachings seriously, and they shaped his character in a way that
left a lasting impression on me. Freemasonry, at least for sincere
practitioners like my father, didn’t represent the bookish sort of philosophy
taught in the ivory towers of universities, but rather something derived from
a much older conception of Western philosophy as a spiritual way of life.
As it happened, I wasn’t old enough to become a Freemason, and with
my reputation around town I wouldn’t have been invited to join anyway. So,
with negligible formal education behind me, I began reading everything I
could about philosophy and religion. I’m not sure I would have even been
able to articulate exactly what I was looking for at that time, except that it
would have to somehow combine my interests in philosophy, meditation,
and psychotherapy. I needed a more rational, philosophical guide to life, but
nothing seemed to fit the bill. Then I had the good fortune to encounter
Socrates.

I had been studying the collection of ancient Gnostic texts discovered at
Nag Hammadi in Egypt, which are inflected with Greek philosophy. This
led me to begin reading the Platonic dialogues, which portray Socrates, the
quintessential Greek philosopher, questioning his friends and other
interlocutors about their deepest values. He tended to focus on the cardinal
virtues of Greek philosophy, later adopted by Freemasons. Socrates didn’t
write any books on philosophy—we know about him only through the
works of others, mainly dialogues written by two of his most famous
students, Plato and Xenophon. According to legend, Socrates was the first
person to apply the philosophical method to ethical questions. He
particularly wanted to help others to live wisely, in accord with reason. For
Socrates, philosophy was not only a moral guide but also a kind of
psychological therapy. Doing philosophy, he said, can help us overcome
our fear of death, improve our character, and even find a genuine sense of
fulfillment.
The Socratic dialogues are often notoriously inconclusive. Indeed,
Socrates’s insistence that he knew that he knew nothing about certain
matters, referred to as “Socratic irony,” later inspired the tradition known as
Greek Skepticism. Nevertheless, he appears to have communicated positive
teachings to his students about the best way to live. The cornerstone of
these is captured in a famous passage from Plato’s Apology. Socrates faces
the trumped-up charges of impiety and corrupting the youth, which would
lead to his execution. Rather than apologize, though, or plead for mercy and
parade his weeping wife and children before the jury as others did, he just
carries on doing philosophy by questioning his accusers and lecturing the
jury on ethics. At one point, he explains in plain language what it means to
him to be a philosopher:
For I go around doing nothing but persuading both young and old among you not to care for
your body or your wealth in preference to or as strongly as for the best possible state of your
soul, as I say to you: “Wealth does not bring about virtue, but virtue makes wealth and
everything else good for men, both individually and collectively.”2

That’s how he lived his life, and his students sought to emulate that
example. We are to place more importance upon wisdom and virtue than

anything else. A “philosopher,” in Socrates’s sense, is therefore a person
who lives according to these values: someone who literally loves wisdom,
the original meaning of the word.
Looking back, I realize that I turned to Socrates and other ancient
philosophers to find a philosophy of life like the one my father had found in
Freemasonry. However, as mentioned earlier, the surviving dialogues
typically portray Socrates’s method of questioning rather than providing a
detailed practical account of the Socratic art of living wisely.
While the ancient philosophers didn’t provide me with the practical
answers I was looking for back then, they did inspire me to read further. My
newfound sense of purpose also helped me to get my life back on track: I
stopped getting in trouble and enrolled to study philosophy at university, in
Aberdeen. I noticed, though, that something wasn’t right—the way we
approached the subject was too academic and theoretical. The more time I
spent in the basement of the library poring over books, the further away I
seemed to be drifting from Socrates’s original conception of philosophy as a
way of life, something that could improve our character and help us
flourish. If ancient philosophers were veritable warriors of the mind, their
modern counterparts had become more like librarians of the mind, more
interested in collating and organizing ideas than putting philosophy to work
on a daily basis as a psychological practice.
Upon graduating, I began studying and training in psychotherapy
because learning to help others seemed to offer me a route to selfimprovement that I could relate to my studies in philosophy. It was a time
of transition for the therapy field: Freudian and Jungian psychoanalytic
approaches were slowly giving way to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT),
which has since become the dominant form of evidence-based practice in
psychotherapy. CBT was closer to the philosophical practice I was looking
for because it encourages us to apply reason to our emotions. However, it’s
something you typically do for a few months and then set aside. It certainly
doesn’t aim to provide us with a whole way of life.
Modern therapy is necessarily more modest in scope than the ancient
Socratic art of living—most of us these days are looking for a quick
solution to our mental health problems. Nevertheless, once I started

working as a psychotherapist, it became evident to me that most of my
clients who suffered from anxiety or depression benefited from the
realization that their distress was due to their underlying values. Everyone
knows that when we believe very strongly that something very bad has
happened, we typically become upset as a result. Likewise, if we believe
that something is very good and desirable, we become anxious when it’s
threatened or sad if it has already been lost. For example, in order to feel
social anxiety, you have to believe that other people’s negative opinions of
you are worth getting upset about, that it’s really bad if they dislike you and
really important to win their approval. Even people who suffer from severe
social anxiety disorder (social phobia) tend to feel “normal” when speaking
to children or to their close friends about trivial matters, with a few
exceptions. Nevertheless, they feel highly anxious when talking to people
they think are very important about subjects they think are very important.
If your fundamental worldview, by contrast, assumes that your status in the
eyes of others is of negligible importance, then it follows that you should be
beyond the reach of social anxiety.
Anyone, I reasoned, who could adopt a healthier and more rational set of
core values, with greater indifference toward the things most of us worry
about in life, should be able to become much more emotionally resilient. I
just couldn’t figure out how to combine the philosophy and values of
Socrates with something like the therapeutic tools of CBT. Around that
time, though, as I was training in counseling and psychotherapy, everything
changed for me because I suddenly discovered Stoicism.
The potential value of Stoicism struck me immediately when I stumbled
across the French scholar Pierre Hadot’s What Is Ancient Philosophy?
(1998) and Philosophy as a Way of Life (2004). As the latter title implies,
Hadot explored in depth the idea that ancient Western philosophers did in
fact approach philosophy as a way of life. My eyes were opened to a whole
treasure trove of spiritual practices, tucked away in the literature of Greek
and Roman philosophy, which were clearly designed to help people
overcome emotional suffering and develop strength of character. Hadot
discovered that contemplative practices became very common in the
philosophical schools of the Hellenistic period, a few generations after the

death of Socrates. The Stoic school in particular focused on the practical
side of Socratic philosophy, not only through the development of virtues
such as self-discipline and courage (what we might call emotional
resilience) but also through extensive use of psychological exercises.
Something puzzled me, though. Hadot compared these philosophical
practices to early Christian spiritual exercises. As a psychotherapist, I
spotted immediately that most of the philosophical or spiritual exercises he
identified could be compared to psychological exercises found in modern
psychotherapy. It very soon became evident to me that Stoicism was, in
fact, the school of ancient Western philosophy with the most explicitly
therapeutic orientation and the largest armamentarium, or toolbox, of
psychological techniques at its disposal. After scouring books on
philosophy for over a decade, I realized that I’d been looking everywhere
except in the right place. “The stone the builders rejected has become the
cornerstone” (118th Psalm).
As I began to devour the literature on Stoicism, I noticed that the form of
modern psychotherapy most akin to it was rational emotive behavior
therapy (REBT), the main precursor to CBT, first developed by Albert Ellis
in the 1950s. Ellis and Aaron T. Beck, the other main pioneer of CBT, had
both cited Stoic philosophy as the inspiration for their respective
approaches. For instance, Beck and his colleagues had written in The
Cognitive Therapy of Depression, “The philosophical origins of cognitive
therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers.”3 Indeed, CBT and
Stoicism have some fundamental psychological assumptions in common,
particularly the “cognitive theory of emotion,” which holds that our
emotions are mainly determined by our beliefs. Anxiety largely consists of
the belief, for example, that “something bad is going to happen,” according
to Beck. From shared premises, moreover, Stoicism and CBT were bound
to arrive at similar conclusions about what sort of psychological techniques
might be helpful to people suffering from anxiety, anger, depression, and
other problems.
One Stoic technique particularly caught my attention. Although it’s well
attested in the ancient sources, there’s very little mention of anything like
the “view from above”—as Hadot called it—in modern psychotherapy or

self-help literature. It involves picturing events as though seen from high
overhead, as they might be seen by the gods atop Mount Olympus, perhaps.
Broadening our perspective often induces a sense of emotional equanimity.
As I practiced it myself, I noticed, as Hadot did, that it brings together a
confluence of themes central to ancient philosophy in a single vision. I also
found that it was easy to turn it into a guided meditation script. As I was
now training psychotherapists myself and speaking at conferences, I was
able to guide rooms full of experienced therapists and trainees, up to a
hundred at a time, through my version of the exercise. I was pleasantly
surprised to discover that they took to it instantly, and it became one of their
favorite exercises. They would describe how they were able to remain
exceptionally calm while contemplating their situation in life from a
detached perspective. I began sharing my resources online via my personal
blog.
In America, the marketer and entrepreneur Ryan Holiday embraced
Stoicism in The Obstacle Is the Way (2014) and The Daily Stoic (2016,
coauthored with Stephen Hanselman). In the UK, the illusionist and
television celebrity Derren Brown later published a book called Happy
(2017), which drew inspiration from the Stoics. These authors were
reaching a whole new audience far beyond academia and introducing it to
Stoicism as a form of self-help and a philosophy of life. The scientific
skeptic and professor of philosophy Massimo Pigliucci published How to
Be a Stoic in 2017. In the same year, Republican politician Pat McGeehan
released Stoicism and the Statehouse. Stoicism was also being used in the
military, as part of Colonel Thomas Jarrett’s Warrior Resilience Training.
The NFL executive and former New England Patriots coach Michael
Lombardi embraced it, and the philosophy began to gain more and more
adherents from the world of sports. Stoicism was clearly experiencing a
resurgence in popularity, and this was just the tip of the iceberg. Online
communities for Stoics were flourishing, attracting hundreds of thousands
of members across the internet.
TELLING THE STORY OF STOICISM

A few years ago, when my daughter Poppy was four, she began asking me
to tell her stories. I didn’t know any children’s stories, so I told her what
came to mind: Greek myths, stories about heroes and philosophers. One of
her favorites was about the Greek general Xenophon. Late one night, as a
young man, he was walking through an alleyway between two buildings
near the Athenian marketplace. Suddenly a mysterious stranger, hidden in
the shadows, blocked his path with a wooden staff. A voice inquired from
the darkness, “Do you know where someone should go if he wants to buy
goods?” Xenophon replied that they were right beside the agora, the finest
marketplace in the world. There you could buy any goods your heart
desired: jewelry, food, clothing, and so on. The stranger paused for a
moment before asking another question: “Where, then, should one go in
order to learn how to become a good person?” Xenophon was dumbstruck.
He had no idea how to answer. The mysterious figure then lowered his staff,
stepped out of the shadows, and introduced himself as Socrates. Socrates
said that they should both try to discover how someone could become a
good person, because that’s surely more important than knowing where to
buy all sorts of goods. So Xenophon went with Socrates and became one of
his closest friends and followers.
I told Poppy that most people believe there are lots of good things—nice
food, clothes, houses, money, etc.—and lots of bad things in life, but
Socrates said perhaps they’re all wrong. He wondered if there was only one
good thing, and if it was inside of us rather than outside. Maybe it was
something like wisdom or bravery. Poppy thought for a minute, then, to my
surprise, she shook her head, saying, “That’s not true, Daddy!” which made
me smile. Then she said something else: “Tell me that story again,” because
she wanted to continue to think about it. She asked me how Socrates
became so wise, and I told her the secret of his wisdom: he asked lots of
questions about the most important things in life, and then he listened very
carefully to the answers. So I kept telling stories, and she kept asking lots of
questions. As I came to realize, these little anecdotes about Socrates did
much more than just teach her things. They encouraged her to think for
herself about what it means to live wisely.

One day, Poppy asked me to write down the stories I was telling her, so I
did. I made them longer and more detailed, then I read them back to her. I
shared some of them online, via my blog. Telling her these stories and
discussing them with her made me realize that this was, in many ways, a
better approach to teaching philosophy as a way of life. It allowed us to
consider the example set by famous philosophers and whether or not they
provide good role models. I began to think that a book that taught Stoic
principles through real stories about its ancient practitioners might prove
helpful not just to my little girl but to other people as well.
Next, I asked myself who was the best candidate to use as a Stoic role
model, about whom I could tell stories that would bring the philosophy to
life and put flesh on its bones. The obvious answer was Marcus Aurelius.
We know very little about the lives of most ancient philosophers, but
Marcus was a Roman emperor, so far more evidence survives about his life
and character. One of the few surviving Stoic texts consists of his personal
notes to himself about his contemplative practices, known today as The
Meditations. Marcus begins The Meditations with a chapter written in a
completely different style from the rest of the book: a catalogue of the
virtues, the traits he most admired in his family and teachers. He lists about
sixteen people in all. It seems he also believed the best way to begin
studying Stoic philosophy was to look at living examples of the virtues. I
think it makes sense to view Marcus’s life as an example of Stoicism in the
same way that he viewed the lives of his own Stoic teachers.
The following chapters are all based upon a careful reading of history.
Although I’ve drawn on a wide range of sources, we learn about Marcus’s
life and character mainly from the Roman historical accounts in Cassius
Dio, Herodian, and the Historia Augusta, as well as from Marcus’s own
words in The Meditations. Sometimes I’ve added minor details or pieces of
dialogue to flesh out the story, but this is how, based on the available
evidence, I imagine the events of Marcus’s life to have unfolded.
The final chapter of this book is written in a different style, resembling a
guided meditation. It’s closely based on ideas presented in The Meditations
of Marcus Aurelius, although I’ve paraphrased his words to turn them into a
longer account that’s deliberately intended to evoke mental imagery and a

more elaborate contemplative experience. I’ve also included a few sayings
and ideas derived from other Stoic authors. I gave it the form of an internal
monologue or fantasy because I felt that was a good way to present the
Stoic contemplation of death and the “view from above.”
This entire book is designed to help you follow Marcus in acquiring
Stoic strength of mind and eventually a more profound sense of fulfillment.
You’ll find that I’ve combined Stoicism with elements of CBT in many
places, which as we’ve seen is only natural because CBT was inspired by
Stoicism and they have some fundamental things in common. So you’ll
notice that I refer to modern therapeutic ideas like “cognitive distancing,”
which is the ability to distinguish our thoughts from external reality, and
“functional analysis,” which is evaluating the consequences of different
courses of action. CBT is a short-term therapy, a remedial approach to
mental health issues like anxiety and depression. Everyone knows that
prevention is better than cure. Techniques and concepts from CBT have
been adapted for use in resilience building, to reduce the risk of developing
serious emotional problems in the future. However, I believe that for many
people a combination of Stoic philosophy and CBT may be even more
suited for use as a long-term preventive approach. When we take it on as a
philosophy of life, with daily practice, we have the opportunity to learn
greater emotional resilience, strength of character, and moral integrity.
That’s what this book is really about.
The Stoics can teach you how to find a sense of purpose in life, how to
face adversity, how to conquer anger within yourself, moderate your
desires, experience healthy sources of joy, endure pain and illness patiently
and with dignity, exhibit courage in the face of your anxieties, cope with
loss, and perhaps even confront your own mortality while remaining as
unperturbed as Socrates. Marcus Aurelius faced colossal challenges during
his reign as emperor of Rome. The Meditations provides a window into his
soul, allowing us to see how he guided himself through it all. Indeed, I
would invite you, as a reader, to put effort into reading this book in a special
way, to try and place yourself in Marcus’s shoes and look at life through his
eyes, through the lens of his philosophy. Let’s see if we can accompany him
on the journey he made as he transformed himself, day by day, into a fully-

fledged Stoic. Fate permitting, more people may be able to apply the
wisdom of Stoicism to the real challenges and everyday problems of
modern living. However, that change won’t leap off the page. It only comes
by making a firm decision, here and now, to begin putting ideas like these
into practice. As Marcus wrote to himself,
Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be; just be one.4

1.
THE DEAD EMPEROR

The year is 180 AD. As another long and difficult winter draws to a close on
the northern frontier, the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius lies dying in bed
at his military camp in Vindobona (modern-day Vienna). Six days ago he
was stricken with a fever, and the symptoms have been worsening rapidly.
It’s clear to his physicians that he is finally about to succumb to the great
Antonine Plague (probably a strain of smallpox), which has been ravaging
the empire for the past fourteen years. Marcus is nearly sixty and physically
frail, and all the signs show he’s unlikely to recover. However, to the
physicians and courtiers present he seems strangely calm, almost
indifferent. He has been preparing for this moment most of his life. The
Stoic philosophy he follows has taught him to practice contemplating his
own mortality calmly and rationally. To learn how to die, according to the
Stoics, is to unlearn how to be a slave.
This philosophical attitude toward death didn’t come naturally to
Marcus. His father passed away when Marcus was only a few years old,
leaving him a solemn child. When he reached seventeen, he was adopted by
the Emperor Antoninus Pius as part of a long-term succession plan devised
by his predecessor, Hadrian, who had foreseen the potential for wisdom and
greatness in Marcus even as a small boy. Nevertheless, he had been most
reluctant to leave his mother’s home for the imperial palace. Antoninus
summoned the finest teachers of rhetoric and philosophy to train Marcus in
preparation for succeeding him as emperor. Among his tutors were experts

on Platonism and Aristotelianism, but his main philosophical education was
in Stoicism. These men became like family to him. When one of his most
beloved tutors died, it’s said that Marcus wept so violently that the palace
servants tried to restrain him. They were worried that people would find his
behavior unbecoming of a future ruler. However, Antoninus told them to
leave Marcus alone: “Let him be only a man for once; for neither
philosophy nor empire takes away natural feeling.” Years later, after having
lost several young children, Marcus was once again moved to tears in
public while presiding over a legal case, when he heard an advocate say in
the course of his argument: “Blessed are they who died in the plague.”1
Marcus was a naturally loving and affectionate man, deeply affected by
loss. Over the course of his life, he increasingly turned to the ancient
precepts of Stoicism as a way of coping when those closest to him were
taken. Now, as he lies dying, he reflects once again on those he has lost. A
few years earlier, the Empress Faustina, his wife of thirty-five years, passed
away. He’d lived long enough to see eight of their thirteen children die.
Four of his eight daughters survived, but only one of his five sons,
Commodus. Death was everywhere, though. During Marcus’s reign,
millions of Romans throughout the empire had been killed by war or
disease. The two went hand in hand, as the legionary camps were
particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of plague, especially during the long
winter months. The air around him is still thick with the sweet smell of
frankincense, which the Romans vainly hoped might help prevent the
spread of the disease. For over a decade now, the scent of smoke and
incense had been a reminder to Marcus that he was living under the shadow
of death and that survival from one day to the next should never be taken
for granted.
Infection with the plague wasn’t always fatal. However, Marcus’s
celebrated court physician, Galen, had observed that victims inevitably die
when their feces turn black, a sign of intestinal bleeding. Perhaps that’s how
Marcus’s doctors know he is dying, or maybe they just realize how frail
he’s become with age. Throughout his adult life he had been prone to
chronic chest and stomach pains and bouts of illness. His appetite had
always been poor. Now he voluntarily rejects food and drink to hasten his

own demise. Socrates used to say that death is like some prankster in a
scary mask, dressed as a bogeyman to frighten small children. The wise
man carefully removes the mask and, looking behind it, he finds nothing
worth fearing. Because of this lifelong preparation, now that his death
finally draws near, Marcus is no more afraid of it than when it seemed far
away. He therefore asks his physicians to describe patiently and in detail
what’s happening inside his body, so that he may contemplate his own
symptoms with the studied indifference of a natural philosopher. His voice
is weak and the sores in his mouth and throat make it difficult for him to
speak. Before long he grows tired and gestures for them to leave, wishing to
continue his meditations in private.
Alone in his room, as he listens to the sound of his own wheezing, he
doesn’t feel much like an emperor anymore—just a feeble old man, sick
and dying. He turns his head to one side and catches a glimpse of his
reflection on the polished surface of the goddess Fortuna’s golden statuette
by his bedside. His Stoic tutors advised him to practice a mental exercise
when he noticed his own image. It’s a way of building emotional resilience
by training yourself to come to terms with your own mortality. Focusing his
eyes weakly on his reflection, he tries to imagine one of the long-dead
Roman emperors who preceded him gazing back. First he pictures
Antoninus, his adoptive father, and then his adoptive grandfather, the
emperor Hadrian. He even imagines his reflection slowly assuming the
features depicted in paintings and sculptures of Augustus, who founded the
empire two centuries earlier. As he does so, Marcus silently asks himself,
“Where are they now?” and whispers the answer: “Nowhere … or at least
nowhere of which we can speak.”2
He continues to meditate patiently, albeit drowsily, on the mortality of
the emperors who preceded him. There’s nothing left of any of them now
but bones and dust. Their once illustrious lives have gradually become
insignificant to subsequent generations, who have already half-forgotten
them. Even their names sound old, evoking memories of another era. As a
boy, the Emperor Hadrian had befriended Marcus, and the two used to go
boar hunting together. Now there are young officers under Marcus’s
command for whom Hadrian is just a name in the history books, his real,

living body long ago replaced by lifeless portraits and statues. Antoninus,
Hadrian, Augustus—all equally dead and gone. Everyone from Alexander
the Great right down to his lowly mule driver ends up lying under the same
ground. King and pauper alike, the same fate ultimately awaits everyone …
This train of thought is rudely interrupted by a bout of coughing that
brings up blood and tissue from the ulceration at the back of his throat. The
pain and discomfort of his fever vie for his attention, but Marcus turns this
into another part of the meditation: he tells himself that he’s just another
one of these dead men. Soon he’ll be nothing more than a name alongside
theirs in the history books, and one day even his name will be forgotten.
This is how he contemplates his own mortality: using one of the many
centuries-old Stoic exercises learned in his youth. Once we truly accept our
own demise as an inescapable fact of life, it makes no more sense for us to
wish for immortality than to long for bodies as hard as diamonds or to be
able to soar on the wings of a bird. As long as we can grasp the truth firmly
enough that certain misfortunes are inevitable, we no longer feel the need to
worry about them. Nor do we yearn for things that we accept are
impossible, as long as we can see with crystal clarity that it is futile to do
so. As death is among the most certain things in life, to a man of wisdom it
should be among the least feared.
Although Marcus first began training in philosophy when he was just a
boy of about twelve, his practice intensified in his mid-twenties, when he
dedicated himself wholeheartedly to becoming a Stoic. Since then he has
rehearsed his Stoic exercises daily, trained his mind and body to obey
reason, and progressively transformed himself, both as a man and a ruler,
into something approaching the Stoic ideal. He has tried to develop his own
wisdom and resilience systematically, modeling himself after the
philosophers who shared their teachings with him and the other great men
who won his admiration, foremost among them Antoninus. He studied the
way they met different forms of adversity with calm dignity. He carefully
observed how they lived in accord with reason and exhibited the cardinal
virtues of wisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance. They felt the pain of
loss but did not succumb to it. Marcus has been bereaved so many times,
has practiced his response to it so often, that he no longer weeps

uncontrollably. He no longer cries “Why?” and “How could this happen?”
or even entertains such thoughts. He has firmly grasped the truth that death
is both a natural and inevitable part of life. Now that his time has come he
welcomes it with a philosophical attitude. You might even say that he has
learned to befriend death. He still sheds tears and mourns losses, but as a
wise man does. He no longer adds to his natural grief by complaining and
shaking his fist at the universe.
Since completing his journal of reflections on philosophy several years
earlier, Marcus has been passing through the final stage of a lifelong
spiritual journey. Now lying in pain and discomfort, nearing the end, he
gently reminds himself that he has already died many times along the way.
First of all, Marcus the child died as he entered the imperial palace as heir
to the throne, assuming the title Caesar after Hadrian passed away. After
Antoninus passed away, Marcus the young Caesar had to die when he took
his place as emperor of Rome. Leaving Rome behind to take command of
the northern legions during the Marcomannic Wars signaled another death:
a transition to a life of warfare and a sojourn in a foreign land. Now, as an
old man, he faces his death not for the first time but for the last. From the
moment we’re born we’re constantly dying, not only with each stage of life
but also one day at a time. Our bodies are no longer the ones to which our
mothers gave birth, as Marcus put it. Nobody is the same person he was
yesterday. Realizing this makes it easier to let go: we can no more hold on
to life than grasp the waters of a rushing stream.
Now Marcus is growing drowsy and on the verge of drifting off, but he
rouses himself with some effort and sits up in his bed. He has unfinished
business to attend to. He orders the guards to send in the members of his
family and his inner circle of courtiers, the “friends of the emperor,” who
have been summoned to his camp. Though he appears frail and has suffered
from illness throughout his life, Marcus is famously resilient. He has
seemed on the verge of dying before, but this time the physicians have
confirmed to him that he is unlikely to survive. Everyone senses that the
end is near. He bids farewell to his beloved friends, his sons-in-law, and his
four remaining daughters. He would have kissed each one of them, but the
plague forces them to keep their distance.

His son-in-law Pompeianus, his right-hand man and senior general
during the Marcomannic Wars, is there as always. His lifelong friend
Aufidius Victorinus, another one of his generals, is also present, as are
Bruttius Praesens, the father-in-law of Commodus, and another of his sonsin-law, Gnaeus Claudius Severus, a close friend and fellow philosopher.
They gather solemn-faced around his bed. Marcus stresses to them that they
must take good care of Commodus, his only surviving son, who has ruled
by his side as his junior co-emperor for the past three years. He has
appointed the best teachers available for him, but their influence is waning.
Commodus became emperor when he was only sixteen; Marcus had to wait
until he was forty. Young rulers, such as the Emperor Nero, tend to be easily
corrupted, and Marcus can see that his son is already falling in with bad
company. He asks his friends, especially Pompeianus, to do him the honor
of ensuring that Commodus’s moral education continues as if he were their
own son.
Marcus appointed Commodus his official heir, granting him the title
Caesar when he was just five years old. Commodus’s younger brother,
Marcus Annius Verus, was also named Caesar, but he died shortly
thereafter. Marcus had hoped that the two boys would rule jointly one day.
Any succession plans Marcus agreed with the Senate were always going to
be precarious. However, at the height of the plague, as the First
Marcomannic War broke out, it was necessary for Rome’s stability to have
a designated heir in case a usurper tried to seize the throne. During a
previous bout of illness five years earlier, rumors spread that Marcus had
already passed away. His most powerful general in the eastern provinces,
Avidius Cassius, was acclaimed emperor by the Egyptian legion, triggering
a short-lived civil war. Marcus immediately had Commodus rushed from
Rome to the northern frontier to assume the toga virilis, marking his official
passage to adulthood. After the rebellion was put down, Marcus continued
to accelerate the process of appointing Commodus emperor. If Marcus had
died without an heir, another civil war would probably have ensued.
Likewise, replacing Commodus with a substitute ruler at this stage
would leave the whole empire vulnerable. The northern tribes might seize
the opportunity to renew their attacks, and another invasion could mean the

end of Rome. Marcus’s best hope now would be that Commodus might
follow the guidance of his trusted teachers and advisors. He is being
swayed, however, by various hangers-on who constantly plead with him to
return to Rome. As long as he remains with the army, under the watchful
eye of his brother-in-law Pompeianus, there’s still hope that Commodus
may learn to rule with wisdom. Unlike his father, though, he shows no
interest in philosophy.
In the middle of their conversation, Marcus suddenly slumps forward
and loses consciousness. Some of his friends are alarmed and start to weep
uncontrollably because they assume he is slipping away. The physicians
manage to rouse him. When Marcus sees the faces of his grieving
companions, rather than fearing his own death his attention turns to theirs.
He watches them weeping for him just as he had wept for his wife and
children and so many lost friends and teachers over the years. Now that he
is the one dying, though, their tears seem unnecessary. It feels pointless to
lament over something inevitable and beyond anyone’s control. It’s more
important to him that they calmly and prudently arrange the transition to
Commodus’s reign. Though Marcus is barely conscious, things somehow
seem clearer than ever before. He wants those gathered to remember their
own mortality, to accept its implications, grasp its significance, and live
wisely, so he whispers, “Why do you weep for me instead of thinking about
the plague … and about death as the common lot of us all?”
The room falls silent as his gentle admonition sinks in. The sobbing
quiets down. Nobody knows what to say. Marcus smiles and gestures
weakly, giving them permission to leave. His parting words are, “If you
now grant me leave to go then I will bid you farewell and pass on ahead of
you.”3 As the news of his condition spreads through the camp, the soldiers
grieve loudly—because they love him much more than they care for his son
Commodus.
The following day, Marcus awakens early, feeling extremely frail and
weary. His fever is worse. Realizing that these are his last hours, he
summons Commodus. The series of wars against hostile Germanic and
Sarmatian tribes that Marcus has been fighting for over a decade now is
already in its final stages. He urges his son to bring them to a satisfactory

conclusion by assuming personal command of the army, pursuing the
remaining enemy tribes until they surrender, and overseeing the complex
peace negotiations currently underway. Marcus warns Commodus that if he
doesn’t remain at the front, the Senate may view it as a betrayal after so
much has been invested in the long wars and so many lives have been lost
in battle.
However, unlike his father, Commodus is scared witless of dying.
Gazing upon Marcus’s withered body, rather than being inspired to follow
his father’s virtuous example, he feels repulsed and afraid. He complains
that he risks contracting the plague by remaining among the legions in the
north and that he yearns more than anything to return to the safety of Rome.
Marcus assures him that soon enough, as sole emperor, he may do as he
wishes, but he orders Commodus to wait just a few days longer before
leaving. Then, sensing the hour of his death looming, Marcus commands
the soldiers to take Commodus into their protection so that the youth cannot
be accused of having murdered his father. Marcus can only hope now that
his generals will talk Commodus out of his reckless desire to abandon the
northern frontier.
Marcus wrote that nobody is so fortunate as not to have one or two
individuals standing by his deathbed who will welcome his demise.4 He
says that in his own case, as emperor, he can think of hundreds who hold
values at odds with his own and would be only too glad to see him gone.
They do not share his love of wisdom and virtue, and they sneer at his
vision of an empire that makes the freedom of its citizens its highest goal.
Nevertheless, philosophy has taught him to be grateful for life and yet
unafraid of dying—like a ripened olive falling from its branch, thanking
both the tree for giving it life and the earth below for receiving its seed as it
falls. For the Stoics, death is just such a natural transformation, returning
our body to the same source from which we came. At Marcus’s funeral,
therefore, the people will not say that he has been lost but that he has been
returned to the gods and to Nature. Perhaps his friends voiced this sentiment
in their eulogies because it sounds like a reference to the Stoic teachings
Marcus held dear. Never say that anything has been lost, they tell us. Only
that it has returned to Nature.

Commodus, unfortunately, surrounds himself with sycophants who
constantly plead with him to return home, where they can enjoy greater
luxury. “Why do you continue to drink this frigid mud, Lord Caesar, when
we could be back at Rome drinking pure waters running hot and cold?”
Only Pompeianus, the oldest among his advisors, confronts him, warning
him that to leave the war unfinished would be both disgraceful and
dangerous. Like Marcus, Pompeianus believes the enemy will view it as a
cowardly retreat and gain confidence for future uprisings; the Senate will
view it as incompetence. Commodus is persuaded for a short while, but
eventually the lure of Rome is too great. He gives Pompeianus the excuse
that he must return there in case a usurper suddenly appears, plotting an
uprising in his absence. After Marcus is gone, Commodus will hastily
conclude the war by paying huge bribes to the leaders of hostile Germanic
and Sarmatian tribes. Fleeing from the army camps will undermine, at one
fell swoop, whatever credibility he had with the troops who were so
steadfastly loyal to his father. Instead, he must turn to the populace of Rome
for support, resorting to expensive crowd-pleasing gestures to win
popularity and increasingly behaving like a celebrity rather than a wise and
benevolent ruler. The Stoics observed that often those who are most
desperate to flee death find themselves rushing into its arms, and that seems
eminently true of Commodus. Marcus lived to fifty-eight despite his frailty
and illness and the harsh conditions he endured in command of the northern
legions. By contrast, Commodus is destined to spiral into paranoia and
violence following repeated assassination attempts. His enemies in Rome
will eventually succeed in murdering him when he is still only thirty-one
years old. No number of bodyguards, as Marcus once said, is enough to
shield a ruler who does not possess the goodwill of his subjects.
The successor chosen by an emperor is an important part of his legacy.
However, the Stoics taught that we can’t control the actions of others and
that even supremely wise teachers, such as Socrates, have wayward
children and students. When Stilpo, a philosopher of the Megarian school,
one of the predecessors of Stoicism, was criticized over the disreputable
character of his daughter, he reputedly said that her actions no more brought
dishonor to him than his own brought honor to her. As things turned out,

Marcus’s real legacy would not be Commodus but the inspiration that his
own character and philosophy provided for generations to come. Like all
Stoics, Marcus firmly believed that virtue must be its own reward. He was
also content to accept that events in life, let alone after death, are never
entirely up to us.
Nevertheless, the Stoics taught that the wise man is naturally inclined to
write books that help other people. Sometime during his first campaign on
the northern frontier, Marcus, separated from his beloved Stoic friends and
teachers back in Rome, started writing down his personal reflections on
philosophy as a series of short notes and maxims. He probably began not
long after the death of his main Stoic tutor, Junius Rusticus. Perhaps he
wrote as a way to cope with this blow, becoming his own teacher as a
substitute for conversations with Rusticus. These collected reflections are
known today as The Meditations. How the text survived is a mystery: it
may have fallen into Commodus’s possession, unless Marcus bequeathed it
to someone else. Perhaps it changed hands at the final meeting with his
courtiers. Disappointed by the feckless character of his son, the dying
emperor would at least know that one of his trusted friends was already
safeguarding The Meditations—his true gift to subsequent generations.
As soon as Commodus has gone, Marcus beckons the young officer of
the night watch to lean in close and whispers something hoarsely in his ear.
Then he wearily covers his head with a sheet and lapses into sleep, passing
away quietly during the seventh night of his illness. In the morning, his
physicians pronounce the emperor dead, and the camp is thrown into a state
of anguished confusion. As news quickly reaches them, the soldiers and the
people fill the streets, weeping. According to Herodian, a Roman historian
who witnessed firsthand the reign of Commodus, the whole empire cried
out as if in a single chorus when word spread of Marcus’s death. They
grieved for the loss of him as their “Kind Father,” “Noble Emperor,” “Brave
General,” and “Wise, Moderate Ruler,” and, in Herodian’s opinion, “every
man spoke the truth.”
As the hubbub outside grows louder, the nervous guards ask their
tribune, “What did he say?” The officer looks like he’s about to speak but
then pauses for a moment. He furrows his brow in puzzlement as he relays

the dead emperor’s message: “Go to the rising sun,” he said, “for I am
already setting.”5
THE STORY OF STOICISM
Marcus Aurelius was the last famous Stoic of the ancient world. However,
the story of Stoicism began almost five hundred years prior to his death,
with a shipwreck. A wealthy young Phoenician merchant from the island of
Cyprus named Zeno of Citium was transporting his cargo of purple dye
across the Mediterranean. Many thousands of fermented shellfish had to be
painstakingly dissected by hand to extract just a few grams of this priceless
commodity, known as imperial or royal purple because it was used to dye
the robes of emperors and kings. The ship was caught in a violent storm.
Zeno narrowly escaped with his life and washed ashore at the Greek port of
Piraeus. He watched helplessly from the beach as his precious cargo sank
beneath the waves and dissolved back into the ocean from which it came.
According to one story, Zeno lost everything in this shipwreck.
Devastated, he found himself living as a beggar after making his way to
nearby Athens: a penniless immigrant in a foreign city. Searching for
guidance about the best way to live, he trudged for miles to the Oracle of
Delphi, where the god Apollo, speaking through his priestess, announced
that Zeno should take on the color not of dead shellfish but of dead men. He
must have been fairly bemused by this cryptic advice. Feeling completely at
a loss, Zeno made his way back to Athens and collapsed in a heap at a
bookseller’s stall. There he started reading what, by chance, turned out to be
a series of anecdotes about Socrates, written by Xenophon, one of his most
distinguished students. The words Zeno read struck him like a thunderbolt
and completely transformed his life.
Greek aristocrats traditionally believed that virtue was associated with
noble birth. Socrates, however, argued that classical virtues like justice,
courage, and temperance were all just forms of moral wisdom, which could
potentially be learned by anyone. He taught Xenophon that people should
train themselves to acquire wisdom and virtue through self-discipline. After
Socrates was executed, Xenophon faithfully wrote down many recollections

of Socrates’s conversations about philosophy. Perhaps it was at this moment
that Zeno suddenly realized what the Oracle meant: he was to “take on the
color of dead men” by thoroughly absorbing the teachings of wise men
from previous generations, teachings such as the very philosophical
doctrines he was now reading in Xenophon’s Memorabilia of Socrates.
Zeno dropped the book, jumped to his feet, and excitedly asked the
bookseller, “Where can I find a man like this today?” It so happened that a
famous Cynic philosopher called Crates of Thebes was passing by at that
very moment, and the bookseller pointed him out, saying, “Follow yonder
man.” Sure enough, Zeno became Crates’s follower, training in the Cynic
philosophy founded by Diogenes of Sinope. Stoicism therefore evolved out
of Cynicism, and the two traditions remained very closely associated right
down to the time of Marcus Aurelius.
When we speak of “cynicism” (lowercase c) today, we mean something
like an attitude of negativity and distrust, but that’s only very tenuously
related to the meaning of capital-C “Cynicism.” The ancient philosophy of
Cynicism focused on cultivating virtue and strength of character through
rigorous training that consisted of enduring various forms of “voluntary
hardship.” It was an austere and self-disciplined way of life. Zeno’s
followers would later call it a shortcut to virtue. Nevertheless, he wasn’t
completely satisfied with the Cynic philosophy and apparently found its
doctrines lacking in intellectual rigor. He therefore went on to study in the
Academic and Megarian schools of philosophy, founded by Plato and
Euclid of Megara, respectively, two of Socrates’s most famous students. All
of these schools focused on different aspects of philosophy: the Cynics on
virtue and self-discipline, the Megarians on logic, and the Academics on
metaphysical theories about the underlying nature of reality.
Zeno appears to have been trying to synthesize the best aspects of
different Athenian philosophical traditions. However, the Cynic and
Academic schools were often seen as representing fundamentally different
assumptions about what it means to be a philosopher. The Cynics sneered at
the pretentious and bookish nature of Plato’s Academy. The Academics, in
turn, thought the doctrines of the Cynics were crude and too extreme—
Plato reputedly called Diogenes “Socrates gone mad.” Zeno must have seen

his own position as a compromise. His followers believed that studying
philosophical theory, or subjects like logic and cosmology, can be good
insofar as it makes us more virtuous and improves our character. However,
it can also be a bad thing if it becomes so pedantic or overly “academic”
that it diverts us from the pursuit of virtue. Marcus learned the same attitude
from his Stoic teachers. He repeatedly warned himself not to become
distracted by reading too many books—thus wasting time on trifling issues
in logic and metaphysics—but instead to remain focused on the practical
goal of living wisely.
After studying philosophy in Athens for about two decades, Zeno
founded his own school in a public building overlooking the agora known
as the Stoa Poikile, or “Painted Porch,” where he used to vigorously pace
up and down as he discoursed on philosophy. The students who gathered
there were originally known as Zenonians but later called themselves
Stoics, after the stoa, or porch. It’s possible the name “Stoic” also hints at
the practical, down-to-earth nature of the philosophy. It arose on the streets
of Athens, out in public, near the marketplace where Socrates once spent
his time discussing wisdom and virtue. The name change from Zenonians to
Stoics is significant because unlike other philosophical sects, the founders
of Stoicism didn’t claim to be perfectly wise. Zeno’s attitude to his students
perhaps resembled the one later described by Seneca, who did not claim to
be an expert like a physician but saw his role more like that of a patient
describing the progress of his treatment to fellow patients in the hospital
beds beside him. This stood in marked contrast to the rival school of
Epicureanism, for example, which was named after its founder. Epicurus
did claim to be perfectly wise, and his students were required to memorize
his sayings, celebrate his birthday, and revere his image.
Zeno told his students that he had come to value wisdom more than
wealth or reputation. He used to say, “My most profitable journey began on
the day I was shipwrecked and lost my entire fortune.”6 Even today it’s not
unusual for a client in therapy to arrive at the paradoxical revelation that
losing their job may turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to
them. Zeno learned to embrace the Cynic teaching that wealth and other
external things are completely indifferent and that virtue is the true goal of

life. In plain English, what the Cynics meant was that our character is the
only thing that ultimately matters and that wisdom consists in learning to
view everything else in life as utterly worthless by comparison. They
believed that mastering this attitude required lifelong moral and
psychological training in the voluntary endurance of hardship and
renunciation of certain desires.
However, in contrast to the Cynics, other philosophers argued that
“external goods”—such as health, wealth, and reputation—were also
required for a good life, in addition to virtue. The problem is that these
external things are partly in the hands of Fate, which seems to make a good
life unattainable for many individuals. Socrates, for instance, was
notoriously ugly by Athenian standards, lived in relative poverty, and died
persecuted by powerful enemies. Would his life have been better, though, if
he’d been handsome, wealthy, and praised by everyone? Didn’t his
greatness consist precisely in the wisdom and strength of character with
which he handled these obstacles in life? As we’ll see, Zeno’s innovation
was to argue that external advantages do have some value but of a
completely different sort than virtue. They’re not always completely
indifferent. For Stoics, virtue is still the only true good—the Cynics were
right about that—but it’s also natural to prefer health to sickness, wealth to
poverty, friends to enemies, and so on, within reasonable bounds. External
advantages such as wealth may create more opportunities but in themselves
they simply don’t have the kind of value that can ever define a good life.
Zeno was profoundly inspired by his early training in Cynicism.
Nevertheless, he sought to moderate and broaden its teachings by
combining them with elements from the other schools of Athenian
philosophy. His wide-ranging studies had convinced him that intellectual
disciplines such as logic and metaphysics could potentially contribute to the
development of our moral character. Zeno therefore established a
curriculum for Stoicism divided into three broad topics: Ethics, Logic, and
Physics (which included metaphysics and theology). The Stoic school he
founded had a series of leaders, or “scholarchs,” and a set of characteristic
core doctrines, but students were also encouraged to think for themselves.
After Zeno died, Cleanthes, one of his students, who had formerly been a

boxer and watered gardens at night to earn a living, became head of the
Stoic school; he was followed by Chrysippus, one of the most acclaimed
intellectuals of the ancient world. Between them, these three developed the
original doctrines of the Stoic school.
The teachings of Zeno and Cleanthes were simple, practical, and
concise. True to his Cynic roots, Zeno focused on improving the character
of his young students while avoiding long-winded academic debates. When
someone complained that his philosophical arguments were very abrupt,
Zeno agreed and replied that if he could he’d abbreviate the syllables as
well. However, Chrysippus was a prolific writer and developed many
arguments—we’re told he wrote over seven hundred books. By his time, it
had become necessary to defend Stoicism against philosophical criticisms
leveled by other schools, especially the emerging Academic Skeptics, and
that required formulating increasingly sophisticated arguments. On the
other hand, Cleanthes, the teacher of Chrysippus, was not a great
intellectual. According to legend, Chrysippus often said that it would be
better if Cleanthes just cut to the chase and taught him the conclusions of
the Stoic school so he could figure out better supporting arguments himself.
Today many students of Stoicism adopt a similar attitude: they’re attracted
to the Stoic worldview but prefer to “update” it by drawing upon a wider
range of arguments from modern science and philosophy. Stoicism was
never intended to be doctrinaire. Chrysippus disagreed with Zeno and
Cleanthes in many regards, which allowed Stoicism to keep evolving.
The original Stoic school survived for a couple of centuries before
apparently fragmenting—into three different branches, according to one
author. We’re not sure why. Fortunately, by that time the Romans of the
Republic had started to embrace Greek philosophy and felt a particular
affinity for Stoicism. The celebrated Roman general who destroyed
Carthage, Scipio Africanus the Younger, became a student of the last
scholarch of the Stoic school at Athens, Panaetius of Rhodes. In the second
century BC, Scipio gathered around himself a group of intellectuals at Rome
known as the Scipionic Circle, which included his close friend Laelius the
Wise, another influential Roman Stoic.

The famous Roman statesman and orator Cicero, who lived a couple of
generations later, is one of our most important sources for understanding
Stoicism. Although he was a follower of the Platonic Academy, Cicero
nevertheless knew a great deal about Stoic philosophy and wrote
extensively on the subject. On the other hand, his friend and political rival
Cato of Utica was a “complete Stoic,” as Cicero puts it, a living example of
Stoicism, but didn’t leave any writings about philosophy. After his death,
making a stand against the tyrant Julius Caesar during the great Roman civil
war, Cato became a hero and an inspiration to later generations of Stoics.
Following Caesar’s assassination, his great-nephew Octavian became
Augustus, the founder of the Roman Empire. Augustus had a famous Stoic
tutor called Arius Didymus, which perhaps set a precedent for the Roman
emperors who followed, most notably Marcus, to associate themselves with
the philosophy. A few generations after Augustus, the Stoic philosopher
Seneca was appointed rhetoric tutor to the young Emperor Nero, later
becoming his speechwriter and political advisor—a position that clearly
placed a strain on Seneca’s Stoic moral values as Nero degenerated into a
cruel despot. At the same time, a political faction called the Stoic
Opposition, led by a senator called Thrasea, was attempting to take a
principled stand against Nero and those subsequent emperors whom they
considered tyrants. Marcus would later mention his admiration for Cato,
Thrasea, and others associated with them, which is intriguing because these
Stoics had been famous opponents, or at least critics, of imperial rule.
Emperor Nero, by contrast, was less tolerant of political dissent from
philosophers, and he executed both Thrasea and Seneca. However, Nero’s
secretary owned a slave called Epictetus, who became perhaps the most
famous philosophy teacher in Roman history after gaining his freedom.
Epictetus himself wrote nothing down, but his discussions with students
were recorded by one of them, Arrian, in several books of Discourses and a
short Handbook summarizing the practical aspect of his teachings. The
Stoics that Marcus knew personally were probably influenced by Epictetus,
and some had likely attended his lectures. Indeed, we’re told that Marcus
was given copies of notes from these lectures by his main Stoic tutor, Junius
Rusticus, so it’s no surprise to find that Epictetus is the most quoted author

in The Meditations. Marcus probably saw himself mainly as an adherent of
Epictetus’s version of Stoicism, although the two never met in person.
Nearly five centuries after Zeno the dye merchant founded the Stoic
school, Marcus Aurelius was still talking about dyeing things purple. He
warns himself to avoid dyeing his character with the royal purple and
turning into a Caesar, instead aspiring to remain true to his philosophical
principles. He (twice) reminds himself that his purple imperial robes are
mere sheep’s wool dyed in fermented shellfish mucus. He tells himself to
dye his mind with the wisdom of philosophical precepts handed down from
his Stoic teachers. Marcus Aurelius, indeed, viewed himself as a Stoic first
and an emperor second.
WHAT DID THE STOICS BELIEVE?
The Stoics were prolific writers, but probably less than 1 percent of their
writings survive today. The most influential texts we have today come from
the three famous Roman Stoics of the Imperial era: Seneca’s various letters
and essays, Epictetus’s Discourses and Handbook, and Marcus Aurelius’s
Meditations. We also have some earlier Roman writings on Stoicism by
Cicero and about a book’s worth of fragments from the early Greek Stoics,
as well as various other minor texts. That’s woefully incomplete, but it does
provide a consistent picture of the philosophy’s core doctrines.
The schools of Hellenistic philosophy that followed the death of Socrates
were often distinguished from one another in terms of their definition of the
goal of life. For Stoics, that goal is defined as “living in agreement with
Nature,” which we’re told was synonymous with living wisely and
virtuously. Stoics argued that humans are first and foremost thinking
creatures, capable of exercising reason. Although we share many instincts
with other animals, our ability to think rationally is what makes us human.
Reason governs our decisions, in a sense—the Stoics call it our “ruling
faculty.” It allows us to evaluate our thoughts, feelings, and urges and to
decide if they’re good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. We therefore have an
innate duty to protect our ability to reason and to use it properly. When we
reason well about life and live rationally, we exhibit the virtue of wisdom.

Living in agreement with Nature, in part, means fulfilling our natural
potential for wisdom; that’s what it means for us to flourish as human
beings.
The Stoics therefore took the name of philosophy, meaning “love of
wisdom,” quite literally. They loved wisdom, or loved virtue, above
everything else. If “virtue” sounds a bit pompous, the Greek word for it,
arete, is arguably better translated as “excellence of character.” Something
excels, in this sense, if it performs its function well. Humans excel when
they think clearly and reason well about their lives, which amounts to living
wisely. The Stoics adopted the Socratic division of cardinal virtues into
wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation. The other three virtues can be
understood as wisdom applied to our actions in different areas of life.
Justice is largely wisdom applied to the social sphere, our relationships with
other people. Displaying courage and moderation involves mastering our
fears and desires, respectively, overcoming what the Stoics called the
unhealthy “passions” that otherwise interfere with our ability to live in
accord with wisdom and justice.
Wisdom, in all these forms, mainly requires understanding the difference
between good, bad, and indifferent things. Virtue is good and vice is bad,
but everything else is indifferent. Indeed, as we’ve seen, the Stoics followed
the Cynics in maintaining the hard line that virtue is the only true good.
However, Zeno went on to distinguish between indifferent things that are
“preferred,” “dispreferred,” or completely indifferent. Put crudely, external
things do have some value, but they’re not worth getting upset over—it’s a
different kind of value. One way Stoics explained this was by saying that if
we could put virtue on one side of a set of scales, it wouldn’t matter how
many gold coins or other indifferent things piled up on the opposing side—
it should never tip the balance. Nevertheless, some external things are
preferable to others, and wisdom consists precisely in our ability to make
these sorts of value judgments. Life is preferable to death, wealth is
preferable to poverty, health is preferable to sickness, friends are preferable
to enemies, and so on.
As Socrates had put it earlier, such external advantages in life are good
only if we use them wisely. However, if something can be used for either

good or evil, it cannot truly be good in itself, so it should be classed as
“indifferent” or neutral. The Stoics would say that things like health,
wealth, and reputation are, at most, advantages or opportunities rather than
being good in themselves. Social, material, and physical advantages
actually give foolish individuals more opportunity to do harm to themselves
and others. Look at lottery winners. Those who squander their sudden
wealth often end up more miserable than they could have imagined. When
handled badly, external advantages like wealth do more harm than good.
The Stoics would go further: the wise and good man may flourish even
when faced with sickness, poverty, and enemies. The true goal of life for
Stoics isn’t to acquire as many external advantages as possible but to use
whatever befalls us wisely, whether it be sickness or health, wealth or
poverty, friends or enemies. The Stoic Sage, or wise man, needs nothing but
uses everything well; the fool believes himself to “need” countless things,
but he uses them all badly.
Most important of all, the pursuit of these preferred indifferent things
must never be done at the expense of virtue. For instance, wisdom may tell
us that wealth is generally preferable to debt, but valuing money more
highly than justice is a vice. In order to explain the supreme value placed on
wisdom and virtue, the Stoics compared reason, our “ruling faculty,” to a
king in relation to his court. Everyone in court is situated somewhere or
other on the hierarchy of importance. However, the king is uniquely
important because he’s the one who assigns everyone else at court a role in
the hierarchy. As mentioned earlier, the Stoics call reason, the king in this
metaphor, our “ruling faculty” (hegemonikon). It’s human nature to desire
certain things in life, such as sex and food. Reason allows us to step back
and question whether what we desire is actually going to be good for us or
not. Wisdom itself is uniquely valuable because it allows us to judge the
value of external things—it’s the source of everything else’s value. How
therefore does it profit a man, the Stoics might say, if he gains the whole
world but loses his wisdom and virtue?
In addition to believing that humans are essentially thinking creatures
capable of reason, the Stoics also believed that human nature is inherently
social. They started from the premise that under normal conditions we

typically have a bond of “natural affection” toward our children. (If we
didn’t, as we now know, our offspring would be less likely to survive and
pass on our genes.) This bond of natural affection also tends to extend to
other loved ones, such as spouses, parents, siblings, and close friends. The
Stoics believed that as we mature in wisdom we increasingly identify with
our own capacity for reason, but we also begin to identify with others
insofar as they’re capable of reason. In other words, the wise man extends
moral consideration to all rational creatures and views them, in a sense, as
his brothers and sisters. That’s why the Stoics described their ideal as
cosmopolitanism, or being “citizens of the universe”—a phrase attributed
both to Socrates and Diogenes the Cynic. Stoic ethics involves cultivating
this natural affection toward other people in accord with virtues like justice,
fairness, and kindness. Although this social dimension of Stoicism is often
overlooked today, it’s one of the main themes of The Meditations. Marcus
touches on topics such as the virtues of justice and kindness, natural
affection, the brotherhood of man, and ethical cosmopolitanism on virtually
every page.
Another popular misconception today is that Stoics are unemotional. The
ancient Stoics themselves consistently denied this, saying that their ideal
was not to be like a man of iron or to have a heart of stone. In fact, they
distinguished between three types of emotion: good, bad, and indifferent.
They had names for many different types of good passion (eupatheiai), a
term encompassing both desires and emotions, which they grouped under
three broad headings:
1. A profound sense of joy or gladness and peace of mind, which
comes from living with wisdom and virtue
2. A healthy feeling of aversion to vice, like a sense of conscience,
honor, dignity, or integrity
3. The desire to help both ourselves and others, through friendship,
kindness, and goodwill
They also believed that we have many irrational desires and emotions, like
fear, anger, craving, and certain forms of pleasure that are bad for us. Stoics
did not believe that unhealthy emotions should be suppressed; rather, they

should be replaced by healthy ones. However, these healthy emotions aren’t
entirely under our control, and we’re not always guaranteed to experience
them, so we shouldn’t confuse them with virtue, the goal of life. For Stoics,
they’re like an added bonus.
They also taught that our initial automatic feelings are to be viewed as
natural and indifferent. These include things like being startled or irritated,
blushing, turning pale, tensing up, shaking, sweating, or stammering. They
are natural reflex reactions, our first reactions before we escalate them into
full-blown passions. We share these primitive precursors to emotion with
some non-human animals, and so the Stoics view them with indifference, as
neither good nor bad. Indeed, Seneca, as we’ll see, noted the paradox that
before we can exhibit the virtues of courage and moderation, we need to
have at least some trace of fear and desire to overcome.
Even the Stoic wise man, therefore, may tremble in the face of danger.
What matters is what he does next. He exhibits courage and self-control
precisely by accepting these feelings, rising above them, and asserting his
capacity for reason. He’s not entranced by the siren song of pleasure or
afraid of the sting of pain. Some pains have the potential to make us
stronger, and some pleasures to harm us. What matters is the use we make
of these experiences, and for that we need wisdom. The wise man will
endure pain and discomfort, such as undergoing surgery or engaging in
strenuous physical exercise, if it’s healthy for his body and, more important,
if it’s healthy for his character. He’ll likewise forgo pleasures like eating
junk food, indulging in drugs or alcohol, or oversleeping if they are
unhealthy for his body or bad for his character. Everything comes back to
the exercise of reason and the goal of living wisely.
By now you’ll appreciate how much confusion is caused by people
mixing up “Stoicism” (capital S) with “stoicism” (lowercase s). Lowercase
stoicism is just a personality trait: it’s mental toughness or the ability to
endure pain and adversity without complaining. Uppercase Stoicism is a
whole school of Greek philosophy. Being emotionally tough or resilient is
just one small part of that philosophy, and lowercase stoicism neglects the
entire social dimension of Stoic virtue, which has to do with justice,
fairness, and kindness to others. Also, when people talk about being stoic or

having a stiff upper lip, they often mean just suppressing their feelings,
which is actually known to be quite unhealthy. So it’s important to be very
clear that’s not what Marcus Aurelius and other Stoics recommended. Stoic
philosophy teaches us instead to transform unhealthy emotions into healthy
ones. We do so by using reason to challenge the value judgments and other
beliefs on which they’re based, much as we do in modern rational emotive
behavior therapy (REBT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
In the following chapters you’ll learn about the different ways in which
Stoicism can be applied to life in order to overcome specific types of
psychological problems, including pain, worry, anger, and loss. Stories
about the life of Marcus Aurelius provide a human face for the philosophy
and will furnish us with practical examples of Stoic strategies and
techniques. We’ll start by looking at Marcus’s early life and education
because that gets right to the heart of the matter by introducing the Stoic use
of language.

2.
THE MOST TRUTHFUL CHILD IN ROME

Marcus was born on April 26, 121 AD, and was “reared under the eye of
Hadrian.”1 He took the name Aurelius later; throughout his childhood, he
was known as Marcus Annius Verus, after his father and his grandfathers.
The family lived in the small town of Ucubi in the Roman province of
Hispania Baetica (in modern-day Spain) before moving to Rome. When he
was about three years old, his father died—we don’t know the
circumstances. Marcus barely knew him but later wrote about his manliness
and humility, drawing from what he learned of his father by reputation and
what little he remembered.
Marcus was brought up by his mother and paternal grandfather, a highly
distinguished senator who had served three times as consul. He was a close
friend of the Emperor Hadrian and was the brother-in-law of Hadrian’s
wife, the Empress Sabina, Marcus’s great-aunt. As a member of a wealthy
patrician family with ties to the emperor, Marcus was naturally part of his
grandfather’s social circle, and though we’re told he was loved by all,
something about Marcus especially caught Hadrian’s eye. The emperor
heaped honors on him from an early age, enrolling him in the equestrian
order when he was six years old, making him what’s sometimes described
as a Roman knight. When Marcus was eight, Hadrian appointed him to the
College of the Salii, or leaping priests, whose main duty involved
performing elaborate ritual dances in honor of Mars, the god of war, while
dressed in ancient armor and bearing ceremonial swords and shields.

Hadrian nicknamed the boy Verissimus, meaning “truest” or “most
truthful,” a play on his family name of Verus, which means “true.” It’s as if
he found Marcus, a mere child, to be the most plainspoken individual at
court. Indeed, Marcus’s family, though wealthy and influential, was notable
for cherishing honesty and simplicity. Marcus’s tendency toward plain
speaking gave him a natural affinity for Stoic philosophy, which he would
discover later. However, it set him at odds with the intellectual culture
prevailing at Hadrian’s court during the height of the Second Sophistic, a
cultural movement celebrating formal rhetoric and oratory. By Hadrian’s
time, Greek art and literature had become highly fashionable. Greek
intellectuals, particularly orators, were highly esteemed and became tutors
to the Roman elite, allowing Greek culture to flourish in the heart of the
Roman Empire.
Teachers of rhetoric, the formal study of the language used in giving
speeches and part of any young aristocrat’s curriculum in those days, were
known as Sophists, reviving a Greek tradition that went back to the time of
Socrates. They often included moral lessons, bits of philosophy, and other
aspects of intellectual culture in their lessons. Hence our word
“sophistication,” which is loosely what they sought to impart. As Socrates
had long ago observed, although Sophists often sounded like they were
doing philosophy, their underlying goal was to win praise by displaying
verbal eloquence rather than attaining virtue for its own sake. Put simply,
while they spoke a lot about wisdom and virtue, they didn’t necessarily live
in accord with those values. They were usually more concerned with
competing against one another to win public applause for their knowledge
and eloquence. The appearance of wisdom therefore became more
important to many Romans than wisdom itself. Even the emperor himself
indulged in this. The Historia Augusta, one of our most important sources,
says that although Hadrian was a somewhat talented writer of prose and
verse in his own right, he often sought to ridicule and humiliate the teachers
of these and other arts in an attempt to show he was more cultured and
intelligent than them. He would get into pretentious arguments with certain
teachers and philosophers, with each side issuing pamphlets and poems

against the other—the ancient Roman equivalent of internet flaming or
trolling.
For instance, the Sophist Favorinus of Arelate was renowned throughout
the empire as one of its very finest intellectuals. He was well versed in the
Skeptical philosophy of the Academy and won widespread acclaim for his
rhetorical eloquence. He shamelessly buckled, though, in response to the
Emperor Hadrian’s dubious assertions about the correct usage of some
word. “You’re urging me down the wrong path,” Favorinus told his friends,
“if you don’t allow me to regard the most learned of men as being the one
who owns thirty legions.”2 Hadrian didn’t like being wrong. Worse, he
carried out merciless vendettas against intellectuals who disagreed with
him. Indeed, when Favorinus eventually incurred Hadrian’s disapproval, he
was exiled to the Greek island of Chios. Nevertheless, for some reason
Hadrian came to admire above all the integrity and plain speaking of a
rather grave young noble, his Verissimus, who loved real wisdom more
than the cultivated appearance of wisdom.
Hadrian was a talented, passionate, and mercurial man, the sort of person
you’d describe as very clever, but not necessarily wise. Perhaps
surprisingly, we’re told he was a friend of Epictetus, the most important
teacher of Stoicism in the Roman Empire. We might struggle to imagine the
famous Stoic putting up with Hadrian’s relentless one-upmanship.
However, the emperor was clearly on very good terms with Epictetus’s
most famous student, Arrian, who wrote down and edited The Discourses
and Handbook. As we’ll see, Arrian rose to prominence during Hadrian’s
reign. Hadrian was no philosopher, though—he viewed philosophy in the
same superficial manner as the Sophists did: a source for material to show
off one’s learning.
By contrast, Epictetus, in typical Stoic fashion, continually warned his
students not to confuse academic learning with wisdom and to avoid petty
arguments, hairsplitting, or wasting time on abstract, academic topics. He
emphasized the fundamental difference between a Sophist and a Stoic: the
former speaks to win praise from his audience, the latter to improve them
by helping them to achieve wisdom and virtue.3 Rhetoricians thrive on
praise, which is vanity; philosophers love truth and embrace humility.

Rhetoric is a form of entertainment, pleasant to hear; philosophy is a moral
and psychological therapy, often painful to hear because it forces us to
admit our own faults in order to remedy them—sometimes the truth hurts.
Epictetus’s own teacher, the Stoic Musonius Rufus, used to tell his students,
“If you have leisure to praise me, I am speaking to no purpose.” Hence, the
philosopher’s school, said Epictetus, is a doctor’s clinic: you should not go
there expecting pleasure but rather pain.
As the years passed, Marcus would grow increasingly aware of his
disillusionment with the values of the Sophists and his natural affinity with
those of the Stoics. We can probably thank his mother for this to some
extent. Domitia Lucilla was a remarkable woman who, like Marcus’s father,
came from a distinguished Roman patrician family. She was also
immensely wealthy, having inherited a vast fortune, including an important
brick-and-tile factory situated near Rome. However, Marcus would later say
that he was particularly influenced by the simplicity and unpretentiousness
of her way of life, “far removed from that of the rich.”4
This love of simple living and distaste for the ostentatious impressed her
son. Several decades later, Marcus revealed his distaste for the pretense and
corruption of court life in The Meditations. He promised himself, though,
that he would never again waste his time dwelling negatively on it. He
added that it was only through recourse to philosophy that life at court even
seemed bearable to him, and he bearable to those at court. He reminded
himself that wherever it is possible to live, it is possible to live well, to live
wisely, even at Rome, where he clearly felt it was a struggle to stay in tune
with Stoic virtue. He found the insincerity of life at court a constant
frustration, and he came to rely on Stoicism as a way of coping.5
Marcus also learned generosity from his mother. When his only sister
married, Marcus gave her the inheritance his father had left him.
Throughout his life, he received numerous other inheritances, and we’re
told he would typically give them to the deceased’s next of kin. Decades
later, during his reign as emperor at the outset of the First Marcomannic
War, Marcus found that the state treasury was exhausted. He responded by
holding a public auction, lasting two months, in which countless imperial
treasures were sold off to raise funds for the war effort. His indifference

toward wealth and the trappings of the imperial court turned out to be of
great value, therefore, in responding to a serious financial crisis.
Marcus’s mother was a lover of Greek culture, and she may have
introduced her son to some of the intellectuals who later became his friends
and teachers. Marcus mentions that his Stoic mentor, Junius Rusticus,
taught him to write letters in a very simple and unaffected style, like one in
particular that Rusticus sent Marcus’s mother from Sinuessa, on the Italian
coast.6 Perhaps Rusticus and Marcus’s mother had been friends for many
years. Along with his mother’s love of Greek culture, some of the oldfashioned Roman values instilled in Marcus during his upbringing doubtless
paved the way for his later interest in Stoic philosophy. Indeed, that may be
why he reminds himself of them in the opening passages of The
Meditations.
Marcus began to build on these values by training in philosophy from an
exceptionally young age. The Historia Augusta says that he was already
wholly dedicated to Stoic philosophy while Hadrian was alive. However, he
seems to have learned about philosophy first as a practical way of life when
he was still a young boy living in his mother’s house, long before he began
studying philosophical theory under several eminent tutors. He first taught
himself to endure physical discomfort and overcome unhealthy habits. He
learned to tolerate other people’s criticisms and to avoid being easily
swayed by fine words or flattery.
Mastering our passions in this way is the first stage of training in
Stoicism. Epictetus called it the “Discipline of Desire,” although it
encompasses both our desires and our fears or aversions. As we’ve seen, the
Stoics were very much influenced by the Cynic philosophers who preceded
them. Epictetus taught a form of Stoicism that held aspects of Cynicism in
particularly high regard. It’s said he was known for the slogan “endure and
renounce” (or “bear and forbear”). Marcus seems to recall this saying in
The Meditations when he tells himself that he must aim to bear with other
people’s flaws and forbear from any wrongdoing against them, while
calmly accepting things outside of his direct control.7
In book 1 of The Meditations, Marcus, after contemplating the good
qualities and lessons learned from his own family, next goes on to praise a

mysterious unnamed tutor, probably a slave or freedman in his mother’s
household.8 It’s truly remarkable that Marcus seems to credit a humble
slave with more influence upon his moral development than either the
Emperor Hadrian or any of his rhetoric tutors, who included some of the
most highly esteemed intellectuals in the empire. This unnamed man
showed young Marcus how to endure hardship and discomfort with
patience. He taught Marcus to be self-reliant and to have few needs in life.
Marcus also learned from him how to turn a deaf ear toward slander and
how to avoid sticking his nose into other people’s concerns. This is very
different from the example set by Hadrian or the famous Sophists
competing to win the emperor’s favor and the applause of crowds at Rome.
The same tutor also persuaded Marcus early on not to side with the Green
or Blue factions at the chariot races or with different gladiators in the
amphitheater. As we’ve seen, the Cynics were renowned for training
themselves to endure voluntary hardship (ponos) through their somewhat
austere lifestyle and use of various exercises. They were also famous for
cultivating indifference toward external things and disregarding both praise
and condemnation from others. Doing so allowed them to speak the truth
very plainly and simply. We’ll never know whether Marcus’s nameless tutor
was influenced by Cynicism or whether he just happened to share similar
values. He certainly provided the child with a solid foundation for his future
training in Stoicism, though.
So who first introduced Marcus to the formal study of philosophy?
Astoundingly, he tells us that it was his painting master, Diognetus. They
would have met when Marcus was aged around twelve, as he entered the
next stage of his education. There are some striking passages in The
Meditations in which Marcus appears to exhibit a painter’s eye for visual
details like the cracks on a loaf of bread, the lines on the face of an elderly
person, or foam dripping from the mouth of a wild boar. These observations
are used to illustrate Stoic metaphysical ideas: the beauty of something’s
apparent flaws and its worth become clearer when viewed as part of a larger
picture. So it’s tempting to wonder if they were inspired by philosophical
conversations that Marcus had as a child with his painting tutor.

In any case, Diognetus taught Marcus not to waste his time with trivial
matters and steered him away from popular amusements such as quail
fighting—the Ancient Roman equivalent of today’s video games, perhaps.
He warned Marcus not to be duped by charlatans who hawked miracles and
magic charms or by those (presumably early Christians) who professed to
exorcise demons. Disdain for the supernatural and caution against wasting
time and energy on diversions such as gambling are attitudes that Marcus
may have learned from a Cynic or Stoic philosopher. Diognetus also taught
him to tolerate plain speaking (parrhesia) and to sleep covered with a pelt
in a camp bed on the ground, almost certainly references to the Cynic
regime.9 Indeed, the Historia Augusta confirms that around the time
Diognetus would have become his tutor, Marcus adopted the dress of a
philosopher and began training himself to endure hardship. However, his
mother argued that sleeping on a mat like a legionary on campaign was
inappropriate. With some effort she persuaded him to use a couch instead,
albeit one still spread with animal pelts instead of normal bedding.
Marcus says that Diognetus taught him these and other aspects of “Greek
training” (agoge). Although we don’t know what all of these aspects were,
we can infer what some may have been. Cynic philosophers often ate a very
simple diet of cheap black bread and lentils, or lupin seeds, and drank
mainly water. According to Musonius Rufus, the teacher of Epictetus,
Stoics should likewise eat simple, healthy food that is easy to prepare, and
they should do so with mindfulness and in moderation, not greedily. Like
the Cynics, the Stoics would sometimes also train themselves to endure heat
and cold. According to legend, Diogenes the Cynic did this by stripping
naked and embracing frozen statues in winter or rolling in hot sand under
the summer sun. Seneca described taking cold baths and swimming in the
River Tiber at the beginning of the year—and cold showers are popular
with those influenced by Stoicism today. Although Marcus doesn’t mention
these details, he may have adopted similar practices as a youth as part of his
“Greek training” in enduring voluntary hardship. The French scholar Pierre
Hadot believed that this phrase alluded to the notorious Spartan training,
aspects of which may have influenced the austere lifestyle adopted by
Cynic philosophers and some Stoics.

Indeed, philosophy in the ancient world was first and foremost a way of
life. Today, “academic philosophy” as taught in universities has turned into
a much more bookish and theoretical pursuit. Ancient philosophers, by
contrast, were often recognizable because of their lifestyle and even the
way they dressed. The Stoics, like the Cynics before them, traditionally
wore a single garment called a tribon in Greek. This rudimentary cloak or
shawl, made from undyed wool usually of a grayish color, was worn
wrapped around the body, often with the shoulders exposed. Certain
philosophers, like Socrates and the Cynics, also walked barefoot. Some
Roman philosophers still dressed like this, although the style was perhaps
occasionally viewed as antiquated and an affectation. Marcus, at least in his
youth, wore the cloak of a philosopher, and as we can see from sculptures,
he had a longish, well-kempt beard, which was probably typical for Stoics
of that period.
Perhaps Diognetus dressed and lived as a philosopher himself and
Marcus was inspired to imitate his example. Once again, it’s striking that at
the height of the Second Sophistic, when oratory and poetry were all the
rage at the court of Hadrian, Marcus was drawn in an opposing direction.
He was wrenched away from the sophistication and ostentation of rhetoric
by the simplicity and honesty of Greek philosophy. In addition to
introducing him to this way of life, Diognetus started encouraging the boy
to write philosophical dialogues and attend the lectures of several
philosophers. (He names three men but nothing more is known about them.)
A few years later, aged around fifteen, Marcus briefly attended lectures at
the house of a famous Stoic teacher called Apollonius of Chalcedon, who
happened to be visiting Rome. Apollonius then departed for Greece, but, as
we shall see, he would soon be recalled.
By this time, Marcus was already an aspiring Stoic. Apollonius and
others must surely have introduced him to the teachings of Epictetus,
arguably the most influential of all Roman philosophers. Epictetus, whose
school had long since relocated from Rome to Greece, died when Marcus
was still a boy, so they almost certainly never met. However, as Marcus’s
education proceeded, he would enjoy the company of older men who had
most likely attended Epictetus’s lectures and were studying The Discourses

transcribed by Arrian. In The Meditations, Marcus names Epictetus as an
exemplary philosopher alongside Socrates and Chrysippus,10 and quotes
him more than any other author. Indeed, Marcus clearly came to view
himself as a follower of Epictetus. However, his family probably assumed
that his education would focus on learning rhetoric from eminent Sophists,
especially once he was designated a future emperor.
Hadrian’s marriage was childless, so in his later years, when his health
began to deteriorate, he adopted a successor. To everyone’s surprise, he
chose a relatively undistinguished man called Lucius Ceionius Commodus,
who then became known as Lucius Aelius Caesar, starting a tradition that
the official heir to the empire would assume the title Caesar. However,
Lucius was in such poor health that he dropped dead little over a year later.
Hadrian reputedly wanted Marcus, now sixteen, to become his successor,
but he felt the boy was still too young. Instead, he chose an older man
called Titus Aurelius Antoninus, who was already in his early fifties and
had two daughters but no surviving sons. He was married to Marcus’s aunt,
Faustina. So, as part of a long-term succession arrangement, Hadrian
adopted Antoninus on condition that he would in turn adopt Marcus,
placing him in direct line to the throne. Hadrian thereby adopted Marcus as
his grandson.
In early 138 AD, on the day of his adoption, young Marcus Annius Verus
assumed Antoninus’s family name, becoming forever known as Marcus
Aurelius Antoninus. However, complicating matters, Lucius Aelius, the
man Hadrian originally appointed as his successor and Caesar, had left
behind a young son of his own, also called Lucius. Antoninus therefore
adopted the child Lucius, who thereby became Marcus Aurelius’s new
brother. Later, immediately following his own acclamation, Marcus would
appoint his adopted brother co-emperor, at which point he became known
as the Emperor Lucius Verus. It was the first time two emperors had ruled
jointly in this way. Marcus presumably made the decision to share power
with his brother at least in part to avoid the risk of unrest caused by having
a rival dynasty with a claim on the throne. (We’ll come back to the
relationship between Marcus and his brother Lucius later.)

At first, Marcus was deeply dismayed that Hadrian had adopted him into
the imperial household. He was reluctant to move from his mother’s villa to
the emperor’s private home. When his friends and family members asked
him why he was so perturbed, he rattled off a whole list of his concerns
about life at court. Based on his later comments, we know he struggled with
the insincerity and corruption of Roman politics. That night, though, after
learning he was to become emperor, Marcus dreamt that he had arms and
shoulders of ivory. Asked in the dream if he could still use them, he picked
up a heavy load and discovered he had become much stronger. Exposed
shoulders were the mark of a Cynic or Stoic philosopher’s endurance
against the cold, so he may have foreseen in this dream that his training in
Stoic philosophy would grant him the strength and resilience required to
fulfill his future role as emperor.
Marcus was now second in line to the throne and destined to succeed
Antoninus. He was introduced to the circle of intellectuals at court, some of
the finest rhetoricians and philosophers in the empire. He must also have
observed the way the emperor bullied them. This was completely at odds
with Marcus’s values, as were Hadrian’s growing suspicion, intolerance,
and persecution of his supposed enemies. Later, during his own reign as
emperor, Marcus made a point of allowing his political opponents to go
unpunished when they publicly ridiculed or criticized him. The most he
ever did in response to outspoken critics was to address their remarks
politely in speeches or pamphlets, whereas Hadrian would have had them
banished or beheaded. Marcus famously pledged that not a single senator
would be executed during his reign, and, as we will see, he maintained this
promise even when several of them betrayed him during a civil war in the
east. He believed that true strength consisted of one’s ability to show
kindness, not violence or aggression.
In his final years, Hadrian became something of a tyrant. He grew
increasingly paranoid, paid agents to spy on his friends, and ordered a
swath of executions. The Senate ended up hating him so bitterly that after
his death they wanted to annul his acts and withhold the traditional honor of
deification. However, the new emperor Antoninus reasoned with them that
it would be better to act in a more conciliatory manner, for which he earned

the cognomen Pius. Hadrian would doubtless have been infuriated by the
fact that despite being mentioned several times elsewhere in the text, he is
conspicuously absent from the first book of The Meditations, in which
Marcus individually praises his family members and teachers. On the other
hand, Marcus listed the virtues of Antoninus at great length more than once
and made it clear that he represented his ideal role model as emperor.
Roman historians portray Antoninus, in many ways, as the opposite of
his predecessor. Indeed, some of the traits Marcus praises in his adoptive
father can be read as implicit criticisms of Hadrian. Antoninus was
completely unpretentious. We’re told that upon being acclaimed emperor,
despite some resistance from the palace staff, he earned great respect from
the people by minimizing the pomp of the imperial court. He often dressed
as an ordinary citizen, without wearing the robes of state, to receive visitors,
and he tried to continue living as he had previously done. Whereas his
subjects came to humor Hadrian, wary of his changeable moods and quick
temper, Antoninus was famous for his calm demeanor and for welcoming
plain speaking at court and elsewhere. Unlike Hadrian, Antoninus would
simply ignore any barbed remarks made at his expense.
The Stoics were happy to admit that some individuals naturally
embodied virtues they sought to acquire through years of effort, by means
of study and training in philosophy. Antoninus was such a man, according
to Marcus. The traits he’s described as possessing paint a vivid picture of
the sort of character that Marcus wanted to develop through his training in
Stoic philosophy. Once Antoninus had considered something and arrived at
a decision, for example, he implemented it with unwavering
determination.11 In The Meditations Marcus contemplates how his
predecessor never sought out empty praise or approval from others; instead,
he was always willing to listen to other people’s views and consider them
carefully. He was meticulous in examining matters that required careful
deliberation. He never rushed making a decision and was always willing to
question his first impressions. He would patiently think over the issue until
he was completely satisfied with his reasoning. He honored genuine
philosophers, though he didn’t necessarily agree with all of their doctrines.
He didn’t attack charlatans, but he wasn’t taken in by them either. In other

words, he was a very calm and rational man. His natural freedom from
vanity helped him to follow reason more consistently and see things more
clearly—unlike Hadrian, he didn’t always have to be right.
Under Antoninus and later Marcus, the culture at Rome would
noticeably shift from favoring Sophists toward philosophers, particularly
the Stoics. Marcus wanted to engage with Greek learning but in a totally
different way than Hadrian. He genuinely sought to transform himself into a
better person instead of merely scoring points against intellectual rivals.
The seeds of that transformation were planted by his family, perhaps
especially by his mother, but they were then nurtured by a series of
exceptional tutors.
Nevertheless, young Roman noblemen were expected to undergo formal
training in rhetoric. This began when they officially reached adulthood,
symbolized by taking the toga virilis around the age of fifteen. Studying
rhetoric in order to communicate more eloquently and persuasively would
become Marcus’s main obligation as a student, although it clashed with his
growing interest in Stoic philosophy. Herodes Atticus and others trained
him extensively in Greek, the language he would use to write The
Meditations. However, once Emperor Antoninus adopted Marcus, his main
tutor became Marcus Cornelius Fronto, the leading Latin rhetorician of the
day.
Fronto was embraced as a close family friend, and he remained so until
his death around 166 or 167 AD, possibly a victim of the plague during its
initial outbreak in Rome. Fronto later wrote down his glowing impression
of Marcus as a youth: he was innately predisposed to all the virtues before
being trained in them, we’re told, “being a good man before puberty, and a
skilled speaker before donning the robes of manhood.”12 Fronto was
important enough to Marcus to be one of the tutors cited in book 1 of The
Meditations. However, Marcus mentions little about Fronto’s influence on
his character and reserves greater praise for Alexander of Cotiaeum, his
Greek grammarian, a lower-grade teacher. Despite the importance of their
relationship, therefore, Fronto didn’t much inspire Marcus as a role model.
He also tried to actively discourage his young student from becoming a
Stoic.

We know Fronto worried that philosophers sometimes lacked the
eloquence required by statesmen and emperors and risked making bad
decisions under the influence of their peculiar doctrines. He wrote to
Marcus saying that even if he achieved the wisdom of Zeno and Cleanthes,
the founders of Stoicism, he would still be obliged, whether he liked it or
not, to wear the purple imperial cloak “and not that of the philosophers,
made of coarse wool.”13 Fronto meant that Marcus was required not only to
dress like an emperor but also to speak like one, draping himself in purple
and winning praise for his formal eloquence. In reality, though, Marcus
preferred to dress down and talk plainly like a philosopher or, failing that,
an ordinary citizen. Fronto’s job was to imbue the boy with the cultural
sophistication befitting his station in life and train him to become an
effective political speechwriter and orator. This was a very difficult time for
the young Caesar, as he felt torn between rhetoric and philosophy. Yet
Fronto’s influence gradually waned. Eloquence is one thing, wisdom
another. We’re told that Plato’s saying was always on Marcus’s lips: those
states prospered where the philosophers were kings or the kings
philosophers.
The contest between Sophists and Stoics over young Marcus had started
shortly after Hadrian’s death, when Antoninus summoned the philosopher
Apollonius of Chalcedon back to Rome. The Historia Augusta claims that
Antoninus instructed Apollonius to move into the imperial palace, the
House of Tiberius, so that he could become Marcus’s full-time personal
tutor. However, Apollonius replied in laconic fashion: “The master ought
not come to the pupil, but the pupil to the master.”14 Antoninus was initially
unimpressed by this response and quipped that it was apparently easier for
Apollonius to make the trip all the way from Greece to Rome than for him
to get up and walk from his house to the palace. He probably assumed it
was just arrogance for a tutor to insist that the emperor’s son should come
to his home for tuition like everyone else. Apollonius was the main
philosopher whose lectures Marcus attended in his youth, which suggests
that Antoninus eventually relented and allowed his son to mingle with other
students outside the palace. As we’ll see, many decades later, toward the

end of his life, Marcus was still causing a stir by attending the public
lectures of philosophers, as if he were a common citizen.
Marcus was impressed with Apollonius’s skill and fluency as a teacher
of Stoic doctrines. However, what he admired most was the man’s
character. The Sophists talked at length about wisdom and virtue, but it was
all just words with them. Apollonius, on the other hand, was completely
unpretentious about his intellectual prowess, and he never became the
slightest bit frustrated when debating a philosophical text with students. He
showed Marcus what it meant in practice for a Stoic to “live in agreement
with Nature”—that is, how to consistently rely on reason as our guide in
life. Indeed, Apollonius was no mere professor but exhibited the true
constancy and equanimity of a Stoic even in the face of severe pain, long
illness, and the loss of a child. Marcus also saw in him a clear example of
what it meant for Stoics to engage in a course of action with great vigor and
determination while simultaneously remaining relaxed and unperturbed
about the outcome. (They referred to this as taking action with a “reserve
clause,” a strategy we’ll examine in more detail later.) Marcus adds that
Apollonius would accept favors graciously from friends, while neither
demeaning himself by doing so nor showing any hint of ingratitude.15 This
man was an inspiration to the future emperor, in other words, and the sort of
person that Stoicism promised to help him become.
Apollonius taught Marcus the doctrines of Stoic philosophy while
showing him how to apply them in daily life. Marcus would have learned
that the Stoics believed there was a relationship between the sincere love of
wisdom and greater emotional resilience. Their philosophy contained within
itself a moral and psychological therapy (therapeia) for minds troubled by
anger, fear, sadness, and unhealthy desires. They called the goal of this
therapy apatheia, meaning not apathy but rather freedom from harmful
desires and emotions (passions). To say that Apollonius taught Marcus
Stoic philosophy is therefore also to say that he trained Marcus to develop
mental resilience through an ancient form of psychological therapy and
self-improvement sometimes described as the Stoic “therapy of the
passions.” An important aspect of this training would have involved

Apollonius showing Marcus how to maintain his equanimity by deliberately
using language in the special therapeutic manner described by the Stoics.
However, before we turn to the Stoic use of language, we first have to
understand a little more about the Stoic theory of emotions. The curious tale
of an unnamed Stoic teacher provides our best introduction to this topic. We
find it in The Attic Nights, a book of anecdotes written by Aulus Gellius, a
grammarian who was a contemporary of Marcus Aurelius. Gellius was
sailing across the Ionian Sea from Cassiopa, a town on Corfu, to
Brundisium, in southern Italy, possibly en route to Rome. He describes one
of his fellow passengers as an important and highly regarded Stoic teacher
who had been lecturing in Athens. We can’t identify the teacher with
certainty; it’s not impossible, though, that Gellius could have been referring
to Apollonius of Chalcedon.
Out on open water their boat was caught in a ferocious storm, which
lasted almost the whole night. The passengers feared for their lives as they
struggled to man the pumps and keep themselves from drowning in a
shipwreck. Gellius noticed that the great Stoic teacher had turned as white
as a sheet and shared the same anxious expression as the rest of the
passengers. However, the philosopher alone remained silent instead of
crying out in terror and lamenting his predicament. Once the sea and sky
calmed, as they were approaching their destination, Gellius gently inquired
of the Stoic why he looked almost as fearful as the others did during the
storm. He could see that Gellius was sincere and courteously answered that
the founders of Stoicism taught how people facing such dangers naturally
and inevitably experience a short-lived stage of fear. He then reached into
his satchel and produced the fifth book of Epictetus’s Discourses for Gellius
to peruse. Today, only the first four books of the Discourses survive,
although Marcus appears to have read the lost discourses of Epictetus and
quotes from them in The Meditations. In any case, Gellius describes
Epictetus’s remarks, which he confidently asserts were true to the original
teachings of Zeno and Chrysippus.
Epictetus reputedly told his students that the founders of Stoicism
distinguished between two stages of our response to any event, including
threatening situations. First come the initial impressions (phantasiai) that

are imposed involuntarily on our minds from outside, when we’re initially
exposed to an event such as the storm at sea. These impressions can be
triggered, says Epictetus, by a terrifying sound such as a peal of thunder, a
building collapsing, or a sudden cry of danger. Even the mind of a perfect
Stoic Sage will initially be shaken by abrupt shocks of this kind, and he will
shrink back from them instinctively in alarm. This reaction doesn’t come
from faulty value judgments about the dangers faced but from an emotional
reflex arising in his body, which temporarily bypasses reason. Epictetus
might have added that these emotional reactions are comparable to those
experienced by non-human animals. Seneca, for instance, notes that when
animals are alarmed by the appearance of danger, they take flight, but after
they have escaped, their anxiety soon abates and they return to grazing in
peace once again.16 By contrast, the human capacity for thought allows us to
perpetuate our worries beyond these natural bounds. Reason, our greatest
blessing, is also our greatest curse.
In the second stage of our response, the Stoics say, we typically add
voluntary judgments of “assent” (sunkatatheseis) to these automatic
impressions. Here the Stoic wise man’s response differs from that of the
majority of people. He does not go along with the initial emotional
reactions to a situation that have invaded his mind. Epictetus says the Stoic
should neither assent to nor confirm these emerging impressions, such as
anxiety in the face of danger. Rather, he rejects them as misleading, views
them with studied indifference, and lets go of them. By contrast, the unwise
are carried away by their initial impression of external events—including
those that are terrible and to be feared—and continue to worry, ruminate,
and even complain aloud about a perceived threat. Seneca gives a more
detailed account of the Stoic model of emotion in On Anger,17 which
divides the process of experiencing a passion into three “movements,” or
stages:
FIRST STAGE: Initial impressions automatically impose themselves on

your mind, including thoughts and emerging feelings called
propatheiai, or “proto-passions,” by the Stoics. For example, the

impression “The boat is sinking” would quite naturally evoke some
initial anxiety.
SECOND STAGE: The majority of people, like those on the boat, would
agree with the original impression, go along with it, and add more
value judgments, indulging in catastrophic thinking: “I might die a
terrible death!” They would worry about it and continue to dwell
on it long afterward. By contrast, Stoics, like the unnamed
philosopher in the story, have learned to take a step back from their
initial thoughts and feelings and withhold their assent from them.
They might do this by saying to themselves, “You are just an
impression and not at all the things you claim to represent,” or “It
is not things that upset us but our judgments about them.” The boat
is sinking, but you might make it ashore; even if you don’t,
panicking won’t help. Responding calmly and with courage is
more important. That’s what you’d praise other people for doing if
faced with the same situation.
THIRD STAGE: On the other hand, if you have assented to the
impression that something is intrinsically bad or catastrophic, then
a full-blown “passion” develops, which can quickly spiral out of
control. This actually happened to Seneca during a storm when he
grew seasick and panicked so much that he foolishly clambered
overboard and tried to wade ashore through the waves and rocks
when he would have been much safer remaining on the boat.18
In other words, a certain amount of anxiety is natural. Indeed, the hearts
of even the most experienced sailors might leap into their mouths when
their ship looks like it’s about to be overturned. Bravery would consist in
carrying on regardless and dealing with the situation rationally. The Stoic
likewise tells himself that although the situation may appear frightening, the
truly important thing in life is how he chooses to respond. So he reminds
himself to view the storm with Stoic indifference and to respond with
wisdom and courage while accepting his initial nervous reaction as
harmless and inevitable. What he does not do, though, is make things worse
for himself by continuing to worry.

For this reason, once the pallor and anxious expression have left his face,
the wise man’s anxiety tends to abate naturally, and he regains his
composure before long. He reevaluates his initial anxious impressions,
confidently asserting that they are both false and unhelpful. On the other
hand, the unwise and fearful perpetuate their own distress for much longer.
Gellius read about this in the lost Discourse of Epictetus and learned that
there is nothing un-Stoic about someone turning pale with anxiety for a
while during a perilous situation like the one he’d just survived. It’s natural
and inevitable to experience feelings like these, as long as we don’t escalate
our distress by going along with the impressions accompanying them and
telling ourselves that some awful catastrophe is about to happen.
Seneca likewise noted that certain misfortunes strike the wise man
without incapacitating him, such as physical pain, illness, the loss of friends
or children, or the catastrophes inflicted by defeat in war.19 They graze him
but do not wound him. Indeed, Seneca also points out that there is no virtue
in enduring things we do not feel. This is important to note: for a Stoic to
exhibit the virtue of temperance, he must have at least some trace of desire
to renounce, and to exhibit courage he must have at least these first
sensations of fear to endure. As the Stoics like to put it, the wise man is not
made of stone or iron but of flesh and blood.
In The Meditations, Marcus himself writes that although he tells
troubling impressions to go away, he is not angry with them because they
have come according to their “ancient manner”; in other words, they arise
in the way basic feelings also arise in animals.20 That implies that, like the
anonymous Stoic teacher on Gellius’s storm-tossed boat, Marcus views
them with indifference rather than judging them as inherently bad.
Elsewhere he says that pleasant and unpleasant sensations in the body
inevitably impinge on the mind because they’re part of the same organism.21
We shouldn’t try to resist them, but rather we should accept their occurrence
as natural, as long as we don’t allow our mind to add the judgment that the
things we’re experiencing are good or bad. This is important, because
people who confuse “Stoicism” with “stoicism” (i.e., having a stiff upper
lip) often think that it’s about suppressing feelings like anxiety, which they
view as bad, harmful, or shameful. That’s not only bad psychology, it’s also

totally in conflict with Stoic philosophy, which teaches us to accept our
involuntary emotional reactions, our flashes of anxiety, as indifferent:
neither good nor bad. What matters, in other words, isn’t what we feel but
how we respond to those feelings.
Although Marcus was reputedly introduced to philosophy at an
unusually early age, it’s believed that he didn’t wholeheartedly commit his
life to Stoicism until Junius Rusticus supplanted Fronto as his main tutor,
when Marcus was in his early twenties. Looking back on this time, Marcus
was grateful that when he first began to dabble in philosophy he didn’t
completely fall under the spell of a Sophist, like Fronto, or end up
obsessively poring over books, working out logical puzzles, or speculating
about physics and cosmology. Rather, he focused on Stoic ethics and its
practical application in daily life. Whereas Fronto counseled Marcus to
dress and speak more like an emperor, Rusticus did the opposite. He was
among those who encouraged Marcus to set aside the vanity of status and
dress down whenever possible rather than walking around in the formal
attire of a Caesar (and later an emperor). This was exceptional behavior for
a Roman of his status, incidentally, but the British Museum has a statuette
in its collection that seems to confirm it really happened. It shows Marcus
dressed not like an emperor but as a common citizen, apparently while
visiting Egypt late in his life.
Rusticus also persuaded Marcus that he shouldn’t be led astray by his
initial enthusiasm for formal rhetoric; neither should he waste his time
writing theoretical essays or trying to win praise by merely playing the role
of the virtuous man. Indeed, Marcus says Rusticus convinced him to abstain
from oratory, poetry, and fine language in general and to adopt the more
down-to-earth and unaffected manner of speaking associated with Stoicism.
In other words, Marcus went through a sort of conversion from rhetoric to
philosophy, and this appears to have been a pivotal event in his life. Why
was it such an upheaval, though? Whereas Sophistry is all about creating an
appearance, philosophy is about grasping reality. Marcus’s transformation
into a fully-fledged Stoic therefore entailed a change in his fundamental
values. It turns out that Stoic “plain speaking” isn’t quite as easy as it
sounds. It requires courage, self-discipline, and a sincere commitment to

philosophical truth. As we’ll see, this change in orientation and worldview
went hand in hand not only with a more Stoic way of speaking but also with
a whole new way of thinking about events.
HOW TO SPEAK WISELY
We’ve seen that Marcus grew up at time when rhetoric was highly
fashionable, particularly at the imperial court of Hadrian. He underwent a
thorough training in speechwriting and oratory from a group of tutors,
including Herodes Atticus and Fronto, the leading Greek and Latin
rhetoricians of his day, respectively. However, from his early youth, Marcus
had earned a reputation for speaking plainly and honestly. In stark contrast
to Hadrian, who loved to make a show of his learning, Marcus tells himself
that true philosophy is both simple and modest, and we should never be
seduced into vanity or ostentation in this regard. Always take the shortest
route, he says.22 The short way is the way of Nature, which leads to the
soundest words and actions. Simplicity frees us from affectation and the
trouble it brings. For Stoics, this honesty and simplicity of language
requires two main things: conciseness and objectivity. It would be an
oversimplification to say that this just means to stop complaining, but in
many cases the Stoics did advise along those lines. The point at which our
language starts evoking strong emotions is precisely when we start saying
things that involve strong value judgments, whether to others or ourselves.
According to Stoic philosophy, when we assign intrinsic values like “good”
or “bad” to external events, we’re behaving irrationally and even exhibiting
a form of self-deception. When we call something a “catastrophe,” for
instance, we go beyond the bare facts and start distorting events and
deceiving ourselves. Moreover, the Stoics consider lying a form of impiety
—when a man lies, he alienates himself from Nature.23
So how did the Stoics recommend we use language? Zeno, who wrote a
Handbook of Rhetoric, didn’t consider verbal eloquence an end in itself but
rather a means for sharing wisdom by articulating the truth clearly and
concisely in a manner adapted to the needs of the hearer. According to
Diogenes Laertius, Stoic rhetoric identified five “virtues” of speech:

1. Correct grammar and good vocabulary
2. Clarity of expression, making the ideas easily understood
3. Conciseness, employing no more words than necessary
4. Appropriateness of style, suited to the subject matter and
apparently also to the audience
5. Distinction, or artistic excellence, and the avoidance of vulgarity
Traditional rhetoric shared most of these values, with the notable exception
of conciseness. However, the Stoic use of language was normally seen as
being completely at odds with established forms of rhetoric.
The Sophists, as we’ve seen, sought to persuade others by appealing to
their emotions, typically in order to win praise. The Stoics, by contrast,
placed supreme value on grasping and communicating the truth by
appealing to reason. This meant avoiding the use of emotive rhetoric or
strong value judgments. We usually think of rhetoric as something used to
manipulate other people. We tend to forget we’re doing it to ourselves as
well, not only when we speak but also when we use language to think. The
Stoics were certainly interested in how our words affect others. However,
their priority was to change the way we affect ourselves, our own thoughts
and feelings, through our choice of language. We exaggerate,
overgeneralize, omit information, and use strong language and colorful
metaphors: “She’s always being a bitch!” “That bastard shot me down in
flames!” “This job is complete bullshit!” People tend to think that
exclamations like these are a natural consequence of strong emotions like
anger. But what if they’re also causing or perpetuating our emotions? If you
think about it, rhetoric like this is designed to evoke strong feelings. By
contrast, undoing the effects of emotional rhetoric by describing the same
events more objectively forms the basis of the ancient Stoic therapy of the
passions.
Indeed, one way of understanding the contrast between Stoic philosophy
and Sophistic rhetoric is to view Stoicism as the practice of a kind of
antirhetoric or counterrhetoric. Whereas orators traditionally sought to
exploit the emotions of their audience, the Stoics made a point of
consciously describing events in plain and simple terms. Cutting through

misleading language and value judgments and stripping away any
embellishments or emotive language, they tried to articulate the facts more
calmly and soberly. Marcus likewise told himself to speak plainly rather
than dressing up his thoughts in fancy language. Indeed, nothing is so
conducive to greatness of mind, he said, as the ability to examine events
rationally and view them realistically by stripping them down to their
essential characteristics in this way.24 In the Discourses we’re told that a
philosopher, presumably not a Stoic, once grew so frustrated with his
friends questioning his character that he screamed, “I can’t bear it, you’re
killing me—you’ll turn me into him!,”25 pointing at Epictetus. That was a
sudden display of histrionics: a blast of emotional rhetoric. Ironically,
though, if he’d been more like Epictetus, he would have just stuck to the
facts without getting worked up and said something like, “You criticized
me; so be it.” In truth, nobody was killing this man and he could bear it.
The way we talk and think about events involves making value
judgments, which shape our feelings. Shakespeare’s Hamlet exclaims,
“There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.” The Stoics
would agree that there’s nothing good or bad in the external world. Only
what is up to us can be truly “good” or “bad,” which makes these terms
synonymous with virtue and vice. Wisdom therefore consists in grasping
external things objectively, as indifferent in this regard. Sometimes the
Stoics describe this as staying with our initial impression of things before
we impose value judgments. Epictetus gives many examples, such as when
someone’s ship is lost at sea, we should say only “the ship is lost” and not
add value judgments or complaints like “Why me? This is awful!”26 When
someone bathes rather hastily, we should not react with disgust or even
imply that he washed himself badly, but say only that he bathed quickly.
When someone drinks a lot of wine, we should not say that he has done
something terrible, only that he drank a lot of wine.27 Marcus follows
Epictetus’s guidance when he says, for instance, that he should tell himself
someone has insulted him in a matter-of-fact way, but not add the value
judgment that it has done him any harm.28 If you stick with the facts and
don’t unnecessarily extrapolate from them, you will put paid to many
anxieties in life.

Zeno coined the Stoic technical term phantasia kataleptike to refer to
this Stoic way of viewing events objectively, separating value judgments
from facts. Pierre Hadot translates it as “objective representation,” which is
the term we’ll use.29 However, it literally means an impression that gets a
grip on reality and thereby prevents us from being swept along by our
passions. It anchors our thoughts in reality. Zeno even symbolized this
concept by the physical gesture of clenching his fist—we still talk today of
someone who looks at events in a matter-of-fact way as “having a firm grip
on reality.” Epictetus explained that a Stoic might say someone “has been
sent to prison,” but they should not allow themselves to go on about how
awful it is and complain that Zeus has punished that person unjustly.30 As an
aspiring Stoic, you should begin by practicing deliberately describing
events more objectively and in less emotional terms. Epictetus tells his
students that if they can avoid being swept along with false and upsetting
impressions, they will remain grounded in the objective representations
they initially perceived.31
Sticking to the facts can, by itself, often reduce your anxiety. Cognitive
therapists use the neologism “catastrophizing,” or dwelling on the worstcase scenario, to help explain to clients how we project our values onto
external events. They turn the noun “catastrophe” into a verb to help clients
remember that viewing events in this way is actually an activity they’re
engaged in. Catastrophizing is also a form of rhetorical hyperbole, or
exaggeration. An event like losing your job is not inherently catastrophic;
we don’t just passively perceive how bad it is. Rather, we actively
catastrophize it, turning it into a catastrophe by imposing a value judgment
upon it that blows things out of proportion.
In cognitive therapy, we learn to take greater ownership of or
responsibility for the catastrophic value judgments that distress us. Modern
cognitive therapists advise their clients to describe events in more down-toearth language, like the Stoics before them. They call it “decatastrophizing”
when they help clients downgrade their perception of a situation from
provoking anxiety to something more mundane and less frightening. For
instance, Aaron T. Beck, the founder of cognitive therapy, advised that
clients suffering from anxiety should write “decatastrophizing scripts” in

which they describe distressing events factually, without strong value
judgments or emotive language: “I lost my job and now I’m looking for a
new one” rather than “I lost my job and there’s nothing I can do about it—
it’s just a total disaster!” Think about it: when you’re distressed, don’t you
tend to exaggerate and use vivid, emotional language to describe things,
both to yourself and other people? Decatastrophizing involves reevaluating
the probability and severity of something bad happening and framing it in
more realistic terms. Beck asks his clients, “Would it really be as terrible as
you think?” Catastrophizing often seems to involve thinking, “What if?”
What if the worst-case scenario happens? That would be unbearable.
Decatastrophizing, on the other hand, has been described as going from
“What if?” to “So what?”: So what if such-and-such happens? It’s not the
end of the world; I can deal with it.
Another common method of decatastrophizing is for cognitive therapists
to ask clients repeatedly, “What next?” Mental images of feared events
often rapidly escalate to the worst, most anxiety-provoking part and then
remain glued there as if the upsetting experience were somehow timeless.
In reality, though, everything has a before, during, and after phase.
Everything changes with time, and experiences come and go. Anxiety can
often be reduced simply by moving the image past the worst point and
imagining, in a realistic and noncatastrophic way, what’s most likely to
happen in the hours, days, weeks, or months that follow. Reminding himself
of the transience of events is one of Marcus’s favorite strategies, as we’ll
see in later chapters. One way of doing that is to ask yourself, “What,
realistically, will most likely happen next? And then what? And then
what?” And so on.
Beck’s original cognitive therapy approach for anxiety was derived from
something known as the “transactional” model of stress, developed by
Richard Lazarus.32 Imagine a seesaw, with your appraisal of the severity of
a situation—how threatening or dangerous it is—on one side. On the other
side is your appraisal of your own ability to cope, your self-confidence if
you like. If you believe that the threat outweighs your ability to cope and
the seesaw tips toward danger, then you’ll probably feel extremely stressed
or anxious. On the other hand, if you reckon that the severity of the threat is

low and your ability to cope is high, then the seesaw will tip toward you,
and you should feel calm and self-confident. The Stoics, like modern
therapists, tried to modify both sides of this equation.
Normally, therefore, once you’ve arrived at a more realistic description
of a feared situation, you will consider ways that you could potentially cope
and get through it. Sometimes this involves creative problem-solving—
brainstorming alternative solutions and weighing the consequences. The
Stoics liked to ask themselves, “What virtues has Nature given me that
might help me deal with the situation better?” You might also consider how
other people cope so that you can try to model their attitudes and behavior.
What would a role model like Socrates, Diogenes, or Zeno do? We can also
ask “What would Marcus do?” if faced with the same situation. In modern
therapy, clients model the behavior of others and develop “coping plans,”
which describe how they would deal with the feared situation if it actually
happened. Considering what another person would do or what they would
advise you to do can help you formulate better coping plans, and that will
typically lead you to decatastrophize the situation and downgrade your
appraisal of its severity. That means going from thinking of events as
“totally unbearable” to picturing realistic ways you can bear them and deal
with them. The more clearly formulated your coping plan is and the more
confident you are about putting it into practice, the less anxious you will
tend to feel.
When their friends were struggling emotionally, Stoics sometimes wrote
them letters of consolation, helping them to view events in a less
catastrophic, more constructive way. Six consolation letters written by
Seneca exist today. For instance, he wrote to a woman called Marcia who
had recently lost her son. Seneca’s consolations to her include the argument
that death is a release from all the pain of life, a barrier beyond which our
suffering cannot extend, which returns us to the same restful state we were
in before we were born. Moreover, Epictetus told his students that one of
the Stoics he held in particularly high regard, Paconius Agrippinus, used to
write similar letters to console himself whenever any hardship befell him.33
When faced with fever, slander, or exile, he would compose Stoic
“eulogies” praising these events as occasions to exercise strength of

character. Agrippinus was truly a master decatastrophizer. He would
reframe every hardship as an opportunity to cope by exercising wisdom and
strength of character. Epictetus says that one day, as Agrippinus was
preparing to dine with his friends, a messenger arrived announcing that the
Emperor Nero had banished him from Rome as part of a political purge.
“Very well,” said Agrippinus, shrugging, “we shall take our lunch in
Aricia,” the first stop on the road he would have to travel into exile.34
You can start training yourself in this Stoic practice of objective
representation right now by writing down a description of an upsetting or
problematic event in plain language. Phrase things as accurately as possible
and view them from a more philosophical perspective, with studied
indifference. Once you’ve mastered this art, take it a step further by
following the example of Paconius Agrippinus and look for positive
opportunities. Write how you could exercise strength of character and cope
wisely with the situation. Ask yourself how someone you admire might
cope with the same situation or what that person might advise you to do.
Treat the event like a sparring partner in the gym, giving you an opportunity
to strengthen your emotional resilience and coping skills. You might want
to read your script aloud and review it several times or compose several
versions until you’re satisfied it’s helped you change how you feel about
events.
Marcus tends to refer to this way of viewing events as entailing the
separation of our value judgments from external events. Cognitive
therapists have likewise, for many decades, taught their clients the famous
quotation from Epictetus: “It’s not things that upset us but our judgments
about things,” which became an integral part of the initial orientation
(“socialization”) of the client to the treatment approach. This sort of
technique is referred to as “cognitive distancing” in CBT, because it
requires sensing the separation or distance between our thoughts and
external reality. Beck defined it as a “metacognitive” process, meaning a
shift to a level of awareness involving “thinking about thinking.”
“Distancing” refers to the ability to view one’s own thoughts (or beliefs) as constructions of
“reality” rather than as reality itself.35

He recommended explaining this to clients using the analogy of colored
glasses. We could look at the world through positive rose-tinted glasses or
sad blue ones and just assume that what we see is how things are. However,
we can also look at the glasses themselves and realize that they color our
vision. Noticing how our thoughts and beliefs tinge our perception of the
world is a prerequisite for changing them in cognitive therapy. Later
generations of clinicians and researchers discovered that rigorous training in
cognitive distancing, by itself, was sufficient in many cases to bring about
therapeutic improvement. Greater emphasis on this cognitive skill is an
integral part of what became known as the mindfulness and acceptance
approach to CBT.
Sometimes merely remembering the saying of Epictetus, that “it’s not
things that upset us,” can help us gain cognitive distance from our thoughts,
allowing us to view them as hypotheses rather than facts about the world.
However, there are also many other cognitive distancing techniques used in
modern CBT, such as these:
• Writing down your thoughts concisely when they occur and
viewing them on paper
• Writing them on a whiteboard and looking at them “over there”—
literally from a distance
• Prefixing them with a phrase like “Right now, I notice that I am
thinking…”
• Referring to them in the third person, for example, “Donald is
thinking…,” as if you’re studying the thoughts and beliefs of
someone else
• Evaluating in a detached manner the pros and cons of holding a
certain opinion
• Using a counter or a tally to monitor with detached curiosity the
frequency of certain thoughts
• Shifting perspective and imagining a range of alternative ways of
looking at the same situation so that your initial viewpoint
becomes less fixed and rigid. For example, “How might I feel
about crashing my car if I were like Marcus Aurelius?” “If this

happened to my daughter, how would I advise her to cope?” “How
will I think about this, looking back on events, ten or twenty years
from now?”
There are several distancing methods found in the ancient Stoic
literature. For instance, you can help yourself gain cognitive distance just
by speaking to (“apostrophizing”) your thoughts and feelings, saying
something like, “You are just a feeling and not really the thing you claim to
represent,” as Epictetus in the Handbook advised his students to do.
The Handbook actually opens with a technique to remind ourselves that
some things are “up to us,” or directly under our control, and other things
are not. Modern Stoics sometimes call this the “Dichotomy of Control” or
the “Stoic Fork.” Just recalling this distinction can help you recover a sense
of indifference toward external things. Think of it this way. When you
strongly judge something to be good or bad, you also commit yourself to
saying that you want to obtain or avoid it. But if something is outside your
control, then it’s simply irrational to demand that you should obtain or
avoid it. It’s a contradiction to believe both that you must do something and
also that it’s not within your power to do so. The Stoics viewed this
confusion as the root cause of most emotional suffering. They pointed out
that only our own acts of volition, our own intentions and judgments if you
like, are directly under our control. Sure, I can open the door, but that’s
always a consequence of my actions. Only my own voluntary actions
themselves are truly under my control. When we judge external things to be
good or bad, it’s as though we forget what’s under our control and try to
overextend our sphere of responsibility. The Stoics view only their own
actions as good or bad, virtuous or vicious, and therefore classify all
external things as indifferent, because they’re not entirely “up to us” in this
sense.
As we’ve seen, of course, the Stoics still believe it’s reasonable to prefer
health to disease, wealth to poverty, and so on. They argue, however, that
we deceive ourselves when we invest too much value in external things.
They also trained themselves to gain cognitive distance by understanding
that events don’t seem the same to everyone: our own perspective is just

one of many. For instance, the majority of people are terrified of dying, but,
as Epictetus points out, Socrates wasn’t afraid of death. Although he may
have preferred to live, he was relatively indifferent to dying as long as he
met his death with wisdom and virtue. This used to be known as the ideal of
a “good death,” from which our word “euthanasia” derives. However, for
Socrates and the Stoics, a good death didn’t so much mean a pleasant or
peaceful death as one faced with wisdom and virtue. Knowing that not
everyone sees a certain situation as catastrophic should make us more aware
that the “awfulness” of it derives from our own thinking, our value
judgments, and our way of responding rather than the thing itself.
Awfulness (badness) is not a physical property. As Aristotle said, fire burns
just the same in Greece as in Persia, but men’s judgments about what’s
good or bad vary from one place to another. Marcus therefore compares our
opinions to beams of sunlight shining on external objects, not unlike Beck’s
analogy of looking at the world through tinted glasses. By realizing that our
value judgments are projections, Marcus says, we separate them from
external events. He refers to this cognitive process as the “purification”
(katharsis) of the mind.
In this chapter we saw how the values Marcus learned from his birth
family, such as simplicity and plain speech, clashed with those of the
Second Sophistic and the rhetoricians at Hadrian’s court. This led him to
embrace the Stoics’ radical use of language as a counterrhetoric, through
techniques such as redescribing events in more objective language, free
from value judgments—an ancient precursor to decatastrophizing in
modern cognitive therapy.
Accepting this approach to describing our situation, whatever it may be,
is a foundational step in learning the other Stoic practices. It leads to the
next step: considering what resources or virtues you have that would allow
you to cope better, or how a wise person might deal with the same situation.
Whether we call it cognitive distancing or katharsis, we separate strong
value judgments from external events by letting go of excessive attachment
to things. You might find this a tricky concept at first, but coming back to
Epictetus’s famous saying—“It’s not things that upset us but our judgments
about things”—will serve you well as a guide.

We’ve seen that Marcus’s disillusionment with court life and formal
rhetoric gradually led him to embrace philosophy more deeply. His personal
mentor Junius Rusticus would persuade Marcus to undergo a more thorough
conversion to Stoic philosophy and embrace it wholeheartedly as a way of
life.

3.
CONTEMPLATING THE SAGE

As a young man, Marcus Aurelius frequently became very angry, often
struggling to avoid losing his temper. Later in life he would thank the gods
that he had been able to restrain himself from doing something in those
moments that he might otherwise have regretted. He’d seen the damage
caused by Hadrian’s temper. During one infamous tantrum, the emperor had
poked out the eye of some poor slave with the point of an iron stylus,
presumably to the horror of onlookers. Once he’d come back to his senses,
Hadrian apologetically asked the man if there was anything he could do to
make it up to him. “All I want is my eye back,” came the reply.1
His successor, Antoninus, was famously gentle and even-tempered, quite
the opposite of Hadrian. In the first book of The Meditations, Marcus
contemplates his adoptive father’s virtues several times, even referring to
himself as Antoninus’s disciple, but Marcus makes no mention of any
virtues possessed by Hadrian. Marcus clearly viewed Antoninus as the
model of an ideal ruler, everything he aspired to become himself. Indeed,
over a decade after Antoninus’s death, Marcus was still carefully meditating
on his example.
The Stoics taught Marcus that anger is nothing but temporary madness
and that its consequences are often irreparable, as in the case of the slave’s
eye. They also provided him with the psychological concepts and set of
tools he needed to master his own feelings of aggression. Marcus clearly
wanted to be more like the humble, peaceful Antoninus than the arrogant

and volatile Hadrian. He needed help achieving this, though. Ironically, he
credits the man who most frequently provoked his anger with teaching him
how to control it. Marcus’s Stoic mentor Junius Rusticus often infuriated
him, but also showed him how to recover his normal frame of mind. As
we’ll see, the Stoics had many specific techniques for anger management.
One of them is to wait until our feelings have naturally abated and then
calmly consider what someone wise would do in a similar situation. Marcus
also learned from Rusticus how to be reconciled with others as soon as they
were willing to make amends. Perhaps that was how Rusticus conducted
himself when he detected that Marcus was becoming angry, providing an
example of gracious behavior that Marcus studied and emulated.
Whereas Apollonius was a professional philosophy lecturer, Rusticus,
also an expert on Stoicism, probably acted more as a mentor or private
tutor. A Roman statesman of consular rank, Rusticus was roughly twenty
years Marcus’s senior. He appears to have been the grandson of a famous
Stoic called Arulenus Rusticus, a friend and follower of Thrasea, the leader
of the Stoic Opposition—a political hero to Epictetus and his students.
Rusticus himself was a highly esteemed man, both in private and public
life. He was also intensely loyal to Marcus. Fronto, with typical hyperbole,
says in his private letters that Rusticus “would gladly surrender and
sacrifice his life” to preserve Marcus’s little finger. Marcus clearly revered
Rusticus, soon came to view himself as the Stoic’s disciple, and remained
devoted to him for decades, even after becoming emperor. For example, it
was the custom in the imperial court for the emperor to greet his praetorian
prefect with a kiss on the lips, but Marcus broke with this convention by
always kissing Rusticus first when they met, as if he were greeting his own
brother. This gesture made it clear to everyone that the philosopher
occupied a special position at court. If Antoninus was Marcus’s role model
as an emperor, Rusticus undoubtedly provided the main example he sought
to follow as a Stoic. As Marcus said elsewhere, philosophy was his mother,
the court merely his stepmother.2
There’s no doubt that Rusticus was the central figure in Marcus’s
development as a philosopher. However, Marcus makes it clear that one of
the most important events in their relationship was when his tutor presented

him with a set of notes on the lectures of Epictetus from his own personal
library. Marcus probably meant the Discourses recorded by Arrian, which
he quotes several times in The Meditations. As we’ve seen, Arrian was a
student of Epictetus who transcribed eight volumes of his philosophical
discussions, only four of which survive. We also have his shorter summary
of Epictetus’s sayings, the Handbook, or Enchiridion. Arrian was a prolific
author in his own right and a highly accomplished Roman general and
statesman. Hadrian made him a senator and later appointed him suffect
consul for 131 AD, and he then served for six years as governor of
Cappadocia, one of the most important military posts in the empire. During
the reign of Antoninus, he retired to Athens, where he later served as
archon, ruler and chief magistrate, before dying around the start of
Marcus’s reign. It’s possible that Arrian is the missing link that connects
Marcus and Rusticus to Epictetus.
Arrian was about a decade older than Rusticus, and they likely knew
each other. Indeed, Themistius, a Roman philosopher of the fourth century,
speaks of them together. Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus, he says, “pulled
Arrian and Rusticus away from their books, refusing to let them be mere
pen-and-ink philosophers.”3 The emperors didn’t let Arrian and Rusticus
write about courage while remaining safely at home, composing legal
treatises while avoiding public life, or pondering the best form of
administration while abstaining from participation in the government of
Rome, we’re told. Instead, they were escorted from the study of Stoic
philosophy “to the general’s tent and to the speaker’s platform.” Themistius
adds that while serving as Roman generals, Arrian and Rusticus “passed
through the Caspian Gates, drove the Alani out of Armenia, and established
boundaries for the Iberians and the Albani.” In reward for these military
achievements, the two were appointed consuls, and they governed the great
city of Rome and presided over the Senate. The examples of men like these
who went before Marcus—statesmen and military commanders inspired by
Stoicism—encouraged him to believe he could be both an emperor and a
philosopher.
We know that Rusticus was appointed consul for the second time the
year after Marcus was acclaimed emperor. He also served as urban prefect

from 162 to 168 AD, effectively making him Marcus’s right-hand man at
Rome during the first phase of his reign. Rusticus died shortly after this
period, perhaps another victim of the plague, and Marcus asked the Senate
to erect several statues in his honor. As with his other tutors, Marcus kept a
statuette of Rusticus in his personal shrine and offered sacrifices to his
memory. So that leaves us with an odd question: What exactly did Rusticus
do to irritate the future emperor so badly?
The answer may lie in the nature of their relationship. Marcus tells
himself in The Meditations that when learning to read and write you cannot
be a teacher without having first been a student, and that this is even truer
for the art of living.4 Students of Stoicism benefited from the wisdom of
their teachers by treating them both as models, whose behavior they sought
to emulate, and mentors, to whose advice they could listen. Rusticus
certainly provided a living example of wisdom and virtue to Marcus. In The
Meditations he mentions that Rusticus was one of three tutors, along with
Apollonius of Chalcedon and Sextus of Chaeronea, who exemplified
Stoicism for him as a way of life. He was also there to counsel him, though,
offering guidance and moral correction. Indeed, Marcus said that it was
Rusticus who showed him that he was in need of moral training and Stoic
psychological therapy (therapeia). This may explain the tension in their
relationship. Marcus clearly loved Rusticus dearly as a friend and looked up
to him as a teacher, but he also found him exasperating at times, presumably
because he frequently drew the young Caesar’s attention to flaws in his
character.
We can perhaps infer which aspects of Marcus’s character Rusticus
challenged based upon comments in The Meditations. For example,
Rusticus taught him not to be pretentious, encouraging him to dress like a
normal citizen when possible. He also taught Marcus to be a careful and
patient student of philosophy, to read attentively rather than just skimming
things, and not to be swayed too easily by speakers who have a silver
tongue. Epictetus likewise told his students repeatedly that they should not
speak about philosophy lightly, like the Sophists, but rather show its fruits
in their very character and actions. In typically blunt fashion he told them
that sheep don’t vomit up grass to show the shepherds how much they’ve

eaten but rather digest their food inwardly and produce good wool and milk
outwardly.5
The most important change Rusticus brought about, however, was that
he persuaded Marcus to sideline the formal study of Latin rhetoric,
expected of a Roman noble, in favor of a greater commitment to Stoic
philosophy as a way of life. Rusticus the philosopher and Fronto the
rhetorician, Marcus’s two most important tutors, appear to have vied for his
attention for nearly a decade, but Rusticus finally won. Scholars date this
“conversion” to around 146 AD, when Marcus was twenty-five. He
confesses in a letter to Fronto that he has been unable to concentrate on his
studies in Latin rhetoric. He is overcome with a mixture of joy and anguish
after reading some books by a philosopher named Aristo. Most scholars
believe this must have been Aristo of Chios, a student of Zeno’s who had
rebelled against his teachings and adopted a simpler and more austere
version of Stoicism resembling Cynicism. Perhaps Rusticus or one of his
other Stoic tutors shared these writings with Marcus. Aristo rejected the
study of logic and metaphysics, arguing that the primary concern of
philosophers should be the study of ethics, an attitude we can find echoed in
The Meditations.
Marcus told Fronto that Aristo’s writings tormented him, making him
conscious of how far his own character fell short of virtue. “Your pupil
blushes over and over again and grows angry with himself because, at the
age of twenty-five, I have not yet absorbed any of these excellent teachings
and purer principles into my soul.”6 The young Caesar was genuinely in
turmoil. He felt depressed and angry and lost his appetite. He also mentions
feeling envious of others, perhaps meaning that he yearned to dedicate
himself to Stoicism and become like the philosophers he admired. It was
around this time that Marcus began to distance himself from Sophists like
Fronto and Herodes Atticus.
What was the process of being mentored by a Stoic philosopher actually
like, though? Why did it have such a profound and lasting impact on
Marcus? The Stoics wrote several books describing their psychotherapy of
the passions, including one by Chrysippus, the third head of the school,
titled The Therapeutics. Unfortunately, these are all lost to us today.

However, a treatise titled On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soul’s Passions
survives, written by Marcus’s celebrated physician, Galen. A polymath with
an eclectic taste in philosophy, Galen had initially studied under a Stoic
called Philopater, and he drew upon early Stoic philosophy, quoting Zeno,
in his own account of diagnosing and curing unhealthy passions. This may
give us some clues about the nature of the Stoic “therapy” Marcus went
through with Rusticus.
As a young man, Galen wondered why the Delphic Oracle’s maxim to
“know thyself” should be held in such high regard. Doesn’t everyone
already know himself? He gradually came to realize, though, that only the
very wisest among us ever truly know ourselves. The rest of us, as Galen
observed, tend to fall into the trap of supposing either that we are
completely without fault or that our flaws are few, mild, and infrequent.
Indeed, those who assume that they have the fewest flaws are often the ones
most deeply flawed in the eyes of others. This is illustrated by one of
Aesop’s fables, which says that each of us is born with two sacks suspended
from our neck: one filled with the faults of others that hangs within our
view and one hidden behind our back filled with our own faults. We see the
flaws of others quite clearly, in other words, but we have a blind spot for
our own. The New Testament likewise asks why we look at the tiny splinter
of wood in our brother’s eye yet pay no attention to the great plank of wood
obscuring our own view (Matthew 7:3–5). Galen says that Plato explained
this well when he said that lovers are typically blind regarding the one they
love. As we, in a sense, loves ourselves most of all, we are also most blind
with regard to our own faults. The majority of us therefore struggle to attain
the self-awareness required to improve our lives.
Galen’s solution to this problem is for us to find a suitable mentor in
whose wisdom and experience we can genuinely trust. Anyone can tell
when a singer is truly dreadful, but it takes an expert to notice very subtle
flaws in a performance. Likewise, it takes a person of moral wisdom to
discern slight defects in another person’s character. We all know that
someone is angry when their face turns red and they start yelling, but a true
expert on human nature would be able to tell when someone is just on the
verge of getting angry, perhaps before they even realize it themselves. We

should therefore make the effort to acquire an older and wiser friend: one
renowned for honesty and plain speaking, who has mastered the same
passions with which we need help, who can properly identify our vices and
tell us frankly where we’re going astray in life. What Galen is describing
sounds somewhat like the relationship between a modern-day counselor or
psychotherapist and their client. However, a better comparison would
probably be with the mentoring or “sponsorship” provided by recovering
drug or alcohol addicts to those who are in recovery and struggling with
similar habits—the help of a more experienced fellow patient, as Seneca
puts it. Of course, finding an appropriate mentor is still easier said than
done.
Marcus wrote that anyone who truly wants to achieve wisdom through
Stoicism will make it his priority in life to cultivate his own character and
seek help from others who share similar values.7 That seems like the role
Junius Rusticus played for him. We should ask that person if they notice
any unhealthy passions in us, says Galen, assuring them that we’re not
going to be offended if they speak frankly. Galen also explains that the
novice is bound to feel that some of his mentor’s observations are unfair,
but he must learn to listen patiently and take criticism on the chin without
becoming irritated. From what Marcus says, that was probably quite
challenging for him at first, although Rusticus was good at smoothing
things over.
Marcus had another Stoic tutor, called Cinna Catulus, about whom we
know very little. Marcus observed that Catulus was a man who paid
attention to his friends when they found fault in his character; even if they
did so unjustly, he would always try to address matters and restore their
friendship.8 Through their own behavior, therefore, Rusticus and Catulus
both showed Marcus that a wise man should welcome criticism from his
friends.
The Stoics clearly inherited their love of plain speaking from their
predecessors the Cynics, who were renowned for speaking very bluntly and
criticizing even powerful rulers. In a sense, it was the duty, and privilege, of
a true philosopher to speak truth to power. One of the most famous legends
about Diogenes the Cynic tells how Alexander the Great sought out the

philosopher. It’s a juxtaposition of opposites: Diogenes lived like a beggar,
and Alexander was the most powerful man in the known world. However,
when Alexander asked Diogenes if there was anything he could do for him,
the Cynic is supposed to have replied that he could step aside, as he was
blocking the sun. Diogenes could speak to Alexander as if they were equals
because he was indifferent to wealth and power. Alexander is said to have
walked off and returned to his conquests, apparently without having gained
much wisdom.
As was often the case, the Stoics adopted a more moderate approach,
and they were concerned that their speech should not only be honest and
simple but also appropriate to the needs of the hearer. There’s no point in
speaking plainly to people if it doesn’t benefit them. Throughout The
Meditations, Marcus makes many references to the value he places on
speaking the truth, but he also consistently recognizes the importance of
communicating it appropriately. For instance, Alexander of Cotiaeum, his
childhood grammarian, made a lifelong impression on Marcus by the tactful
way he would correct those making a verbal error.9 If someone used a word
incorrectly, Alexander would not overtly criticize the speaker. He never
interrupted them or challenged them on the spot. Instead, the grammarian
had a more artful and indirect way of steering them in the right direction.
Marcus noticed that Alexander would subtly drop in the correct expression
while replying or discussing some other topic. If the real goal for Stoics is
wisdom, then sometimes just blurting out the truth isn’t enough. We have to
put more effort into communicating with others effectively.
Diplomacy was, of course, particularly important to Marcus. His duties
as Caesar and later as emperor involved handling highly sensitive
discussions, such as negotiations over peace treaties with foreign enemies.
We can clearly see from his personal correspondence that he was a
charming and tactful man with an impressive ability to resolve conflicts
between his friends. Indeed, Fronto waxes lyrical about this, extolling his
young student’s ability to unite all his friends together in harmony,
something the rhetorician compares to the mythic power of Orpheus to tame
savage beasts through the music of his lyre. Throughout Marcus’s reign, he
doubtlessly averted many serious problems through his patient diplomacy

and sensitive use of language. Indeed, he even reminds himself that he
should always be tactful and honest with whoever he’s speaking to,
especially in the Senate.10
In addition to having this innate talent, Marcus learned a great deal from
the Stoics about how a wise man should try to communicate with others.
Apollonius of Chalcedon, for instance, was not a man to hold back his
words, yet he balanced his self-confidence with open-mindedness. Marcus
describes how another of his most beloved teachers, Sextus of Chaeronea,
came across as both very serious and plainspoken, yet he was exceptionally
patient with the unlearned, and even the opinionated. Correcting someone
else’s vices, Marcus says, is like pointing out that they have bad breath—it
requires considerable tact. However, he noticed that Sextus won the respect
of all sorts of people by skillfully adapting his conversation so that it
seemed more charming than any flattery, even while he was speaking
frankly or disagreeing with them. Clearly, Stoics like Marcus placed a lot
more value on manners and civility than the Cynics did. The Stoics realized
that to communicate wisely, we must phrase things appropriately. Indeed,
according to Epictetus, the most striking characteristic of Socrates was that
he never became irritated during an argument. He was always polite and
refrained from speaking harshly even when others insulted him. He
patiently endured much abuse and yet was able to put an end to most
quarrels in a calm and rational manner.11
We can imagine that when Rusticus challenged Marcus over his
behavior, his remarks, though sometimes provocative and close to the bone,
were probably judicious enough that his young student benefited from them
without feeling humiliated. How can we find mentors with such tact,
though? Galen admits that you’re not likely to meet many people like
Diogenes the Cynic, who was brave enough even to speak plainly to
Alexander the Great. What’s required first is a more general openness to
criticism: we should give everyone we meet permission to tell us what our
faults are, according to Galen, and resolve not to be angry with any of them.
Indeed, Marcus tells himself both to enter into every man’s mind, to study
their judgments and values, and to let every man enter into his.12 If anyone
gives him a valid reason to believe that he’s going astray in terms of either

thought or action, he says he will gladly change his ways. Marcus sought to
make it his priority in life to get to the truth of matters, reminding himself
that nobody has ever really been harmed in this way but that those who
cling to error and ignorance harm themselves.13 We’re told this advice goes
back to Zeno. Most men are eager to point out their neighbors’ flaws, he
said, whether we ask them to or not. So instead of resenting it, we should
welcome criticism from others as one of life’s inevitabilities and turn it to
our advantage by making all men into our teachers. Galen therefore says
that if we desire to learn wisdom, we must be ready to listen to anyone we
encounter and show gratitude “not to those who flatter us but to those who
rebuke us.”14
This doesn’t mean we should trust all opinions equally, of course.
Marcus makes it clear that we must train ourselves to discriminate good
advice from bad and learn not to preoccupy ourselves with the opinions of
foolish people. It’s prudent to listen carefully to most of the people we meet
in life but not to give equal weight to all opinions. Rather, by welcoming
criticism and accepting it dispassionately, we can gradually learn to sort
through it rationally and discern good advice from bad. Sometimes, indeed,
we learn most from the mistakes of others. However, as Galen observes, we
should place more trust in the counsel of individuals who provide us with
consistent evidence of their wisdom and virtue. Nevertheless, if we exercise
caution we can learn from all people while we look for someone like
Rusticus, a friend whose wisdom we can trust implicitly.
For a relationship of this kind to work, though, the student must be
scrupulously honest with their mentor. In one passage, Marcus imagines a
wise teacher instructing someone to think of nothing he would be unwilling
to say aloud, uncensored, as soon as it comes into his mind. Marcus doubts
that the majority of us could really endure this for even a single day because
we foolishly put more value on other people’s opinions than on our own.
And yet he aspired to this level of transparency. He says that we should
imagine someone asking “What’s going on right now in your mind?”
without warning and that we should be able to answer truthfully without
feeling the need to blush. Marcus says he wants his soul to be naked and
simple, more visible even than the body that surrounds it. Elsewhere he

goes even further and, like a Cynic, says we should never crave anything in
life that requires walls or curtains. On one hand, these are expressions of
Marcus’s desire to work toward a lofty moral ideal: being so pure of heart
that he has nothing to hide from anyone. However, he’s also alluding to a
very powerful therapeutic strategy. Being observed can help us develop
greater self-awareness and correct our behavior, especially if we’re in the
presence of someone we admire, such as a trusted mentor. Even in the
absence of your own Rusticus, however, just imagining that you’re being
observed by someone wise and benevolent can potentially have similar
benefits, especially if you pretend that your innermost thoughts and feelings
are somehow visible to them.15
If we wish to improve ourselves, Galen says that we must never relax
our vigilance, not even for a single hour. How on earth do we do that? He
explains that Zeno of Citium taught that “we should act carefully in all
things—just as if we were going to answer for it to our teachers shortly
thereafter.”16 That’s a rather clever mind trick that turns Stoic mentoring
into a kind of mindfulness practice. Imagining that we’re being observed
helps us to pay more attention to our own character and behavior. A Stoicin-training, like the young Marcus, would have been advised always to
exercise self-awareness by monitoring his own thoughts, actions, and
feelings, perhaps as if his mentor, Rusticus, were continually observing
him. Epictetus told his students that, just as someone who walks barefoot is
cautious not to step on a nail or twist his ankle, they should be careful
throughout the day not to harm their own character by lapsing into errors of
moral judgment.17 In modern therapy, it’s common for clients who are
making progress to wonder between sessions what their therapist might say
about the thoughts they have. For example, they might be worrying about
something and suddenly imagine the voice of their therapist challenging
them with questions like “Where’s the evidence for those fears being true?”
or “How’s worrying like this actually working out for you?” The very
notion of someone else observing your thoughts and feelings can be enough
to make you pause and consider them. Of course, if you occasionally talk to
a mentor or therapist about your experiences, it’s much easier to imagine
their presence when they’re not around. Even if you don’t have someone

like this in your life, you can still envision that you’re being observed by a
wise and supportive friend. If you read about Marcus Aurelius enough, for
instance, you may experiment by imagining that he’s your companion as
you perform some challenging task or face a difficult situation. How would
you behave differently just knowing he was by your side? What do you
think he might say about your behavior? If he could read your mind, how
would he comment on your thoughts and feelings? You can pick your own
mentor, of course, but you get the idea.
I think it’s possible that this is, in part, what Marcus was doing by
writing The Meditations. Rusticus probably died around 170 AD, while
Marcus was away commanding the legions on the northern frontier during
the First Marcomannic War. There is some evidence to suggest he may have
started work on The Meditations around the same time. It’s tempting then to
wonder if he did so in response to the loss of his friend and tutor. As we’ve
seen, Marcus described being surrounded by people who opposed his views
and even wished him gone. It sounds as though he really felt the absence at
this time of a friend like Rusticus who shared his philosophical beliefs and
most cherished values.
If Marcus did start creating these notes for himself shortly after the loss
of his Stoic mentor, his purpose may have been to assume responsibility for
mentoring himself. Even today, writing exercises such as keeping a therapy
journal are a popular form of self-help. However, in addition to aphorisms
crafted by Marcus and sayings he quoted from famous poets and
philosophers, The Meditations contains little snippets of dialogue. These
could be quotations from lecture notes, such as the copy of Epictetus’s
Discourses that Rusticus gave him. Or they could be fictional dialogues
invented by Marcus, using his imagination to conjure up an inner mentor.
Perhaps they were even fragments of remembered conversations Marcus
may have had with his tutors many years earlier. For example, one of them
can be paraphrased as follows:
TEACHER: Piece by piece, one action after another, you must build up your life and be content if
each individual act, as far as Fate permits, achieves its goal.
STUDENT: But what if there is some external obstacle that prevents me from achieving my goal?
TEACHER: There can be no obstacle to a man’s efforts to approach things wisely, justly, and
with self-awareness.

STUDENT: But what if some outward aspect of my behavior is hindered?
TEACHER: Well, then a cheerful acceptance of that hindrance is required, along with a tactful
shift to doing what circumstances allow. This will enable you to substitute another course of
action, one in keeping with the overall scheme of life that we’re talking about.18

Galen suggested that imitating a role model is more appropriate in our
youth. Later in life, as we take more responsibility for our own character, it
becomes important to follow specific philosophical principles and practice
living by them. Over the years, with more experience, we should develop
more self-awareness and become able to spot our own errors without
needing the help of a mentor. Moreover, we gradually learn to weaken
passions such as anger through disciplined practice and checking their
expression at an early stage. Doing this frequently will eventually make us
less prone to experiencing such feelings in the first place. Marcus had
trained in philosophy for over three decades by the time Rusticus passed
away. So as he began writing The Meditations, he was probably well
prepared to enter the next phase in his psychological development as a
Stoic.
HOW TO FOLLOW YOUR VALUES
The term “mentor” comes from Homer’s Odyssey. Athena, the goddess of
wisdom and virtue, disguises herself as a friend of Odysseus named Mentor
so that she can counsel his son Telemachus, who is in grave danger. She
remains by their side during the ultimate battle against Odysseus’s enemies,
encouraging the hero toward victory. Marcus said that even aspiring Stoics
should not be ashamed to seek the help of others, just as an injured soldier
besieging a fortress does not blush to accept a leg up from his comrades in
mounting the battlements.19 Not everyone has a Rusticus to get them over
the ramparts, however. If you can find someone in whom you can trust, like
Galen describes, that’s great. In truth, though, most people will probably
have to rely on other modeling strategies, as Marcus perhaps did after the
death of Rusticus. These fall into two main categories: writing and
imagining.

Even if you don’t have a real-life mentor following you around, you can
still benefit from the concept by using your imagination. Marcus, like other
ancient philosophers, conjured the images of various advisors and role
models in his mind. He also believed it was important to consider the
character and actions of famous historical philosophers. At one point he
says that the writings of “the Ephesians,” possibly meaning the followers of
Heraclitus, contained the advice to think constantly of individuals from
previous generations who demonstrated exemplary virtue. As we’ve seen,
the story of Zeno begins with him being given the cryptic advice to “take on
the color of dead men” by studying the wisdom of previous generations.
Marcus tells himself to focus his attention on the minds of wise men,
particularly their underlying principles, and carefully consider what these
men avoid and what they pursue in life. In The Meditations, he names the
philosophers he most admires: Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Socrates, Diogenes
the Cynic, Chrysippus, and Epictetus. Of course, you might even choose
Marcus himself as a role model if you’re studying his life and philosophy.20
Your first step is to write down the virtues exhibited by someone you
respect. Listing the qualities you most admire in another person, just as
Marcus does in the first book of The Meditations, is a simple and powerful
exercise. He explains in a later chapter that he contemplates the virtues of
those who lived with him in order to raise his spirits: the energy of one, the
modesty of another, the generosity of a third, and so on.21 Nothing cheers
our soul, he says, like the people close to us exhibiting virtue in their lives,
and for that very reason we should treasure these examples and keep the
memory of them fresh. Writing things down will often make the image
more vivid and memorable. Stoics considered this a healthy source of joy.
Writing down your ideas about what makes another person admirable,
mulling them over, and revising them gives you an opportunity to process
them. With practice, you will be able to visualize the character traits you’re
describing more easily.
Over a decade after Antoninus’s death, for example, Marcus was still
reminding himself to remain a faithful disciple to him in all areas of life.22
Although not a philosopher himself, Antoninus seems to have naturally
possessed many of the virtues praised by the Stoics. In The Meditations,

Marcus said that it was Antoninus who showed him that an emperor could
win the respect of his subjects without bodyguards, expensive robes,
precious ornaments, statues, and all other such trappings of his station in
life. His adoptive father taught Marcus that it was possible for him, despite
his status as Caesar, to live in a manner close to that of a private citizen,
without losing status or neglecting his responsibilities. Following the
example of Antoninus, he therefore reminds himself not to be “stained
purple” and turned into a Caesar.23 Rather Marcus sought to dye his mind
deeply with the same virtues he observed in others, striving, as he put it, to
remain the person philosophy sought to make him.
Marcus contemplates Antoninus’s vigorous commitment to reason, his
simple piety, his unshakable inner peace and calm demeanor. Marcus even
says that his father was like Socrates in his ability to abstain from things
that the majority are too weak to do without and to enjoy things in
moderation that most people cannot enjoy without going to excess. He tells
himself that if he can emulate all of these virtues, then he will be able to
meet his own final hour with the same equanimity and clear conscience that
Antoninus showed on his deathbed.
In addition to the virtues of real people, the Stoics were also known for
contemplating the hypothetical character of an ideal Sage, or wise person.
There are several passages where Marcus appears to be doing this. These
descriptions inevitably seem a bit more abstract and grandiose. For
example, he says that the perfect wise man is like a true priest of the gods,
at one with the divine element of reason within himself. He is neither
corrupted by pleasure nor injured by pain, and he remains untouched by
insults. The true Sage is like a fighter in the noblest of fights, dyed deep
with justice. With his whole being, he accepts everything that befalls him,
as assigned to him by Fate. He seldom concerns himself with what others
say or do unless it’s for the common good. He naturally cares for all rational
beings, as though they were his brothers and sisters. He is not swayed by
the opinions of just anyone, but he gives special heed to the wise who live
in agreement with Nature.24 Marcus is trying here to describe human
perfection to himself and to envisage an ideal Sage who completely
embodies the Stoic goals of life.

In addition to asking ourselves what qualities the ideal wise person
might have, we can ask what qualities we might hope to possess in the
distant future. For instance, what sort of person would you hope to be after
having trained in Stoicism for ten or twenty years? At one point, Marcus
seems to be describing the long-term goals of the Stoic therapy process he
went through with Rusticus. He says that in the mind of one who has been
chastened and thoroughly purified there is no festering sore beneath the
surface, and nothing that would not bear examination or would hide from
the light. There is no longer anything servile or phony about someone who
has achieved this, he adds, and they are neither dependent on others nor
alienated from them.25 Those are both therapy goals for Stoics and the goals
of life.
Writing down the virtues possessed by a hypothetical wise man or
woman, or those we aspire to ourselves, is usually a very beneficial
exercise. It may also be useful for you to formulate descriptions of two or
three specific individuals and compare these to a more general description
of an ideal. These could be real acquaintances from your life, historical
figures, or even fictional characters. The important thing is to process the
information by reflecting on it and revising it where necessary. Allow some
time to pass and then come back to review and improve your descriptions.
Consider how specific virtues, such as wisdom, justice, courage, and
moderation, might be exhibited by role models you’ve chosen. In general,
thinking things over and looking at these ideas from different perspectives
—however you choose to do it—can be helpful in terms of selfimprovement. Having spent some time on writing exercises, you will more
easily be able to picture things in your mind’s eye. The best way to do this
is to imagine a role model whose strengths you’ve identified coping with a
challenging situation. The Stoics asked themselves, “What would Socrates
or Zeno do?” Marcus likely asked himself how Rusticus and his other
teachers would cope with the difficult situations he faced in life. He
undoubtedly asked himself what Antoninus would do. Psychologists call
this “modeling” someone’s behavior. We’ve already touched upon it briefly
in our discussion of decatastrophizing in cognitive therapy. You might want
to ask yourself, for example, “What would Marcus do?”

In addition to visualizing people to model their behavior, we can also
model their attitudes. Stoics might ask themselves, “What would Socrates
or Zeno say about this?” You can imagine your personal role model—or
even a whole panel of Stoic Sages—giving you advice. What would they
tell you to do? What advice would they give? What would they have to say
about how you’re currently handling a problem? Pose these types of
questions to yourself as you picture them in your imagination and try to
formulate what the response would be. Turn it into a longer discussion if
that helps. Again, if you’re modeling Marcus Aurelius, ask “What would
Marcus say?”
Modeling is typically followed by the “mental rehearsal” of behavior
change: picturing yourself acting more like your role models or imagining
yourself following their advice. This often takes several attempts. Think of
it as trial-and-error learning. Imagine yourself coping with the challenges
you expect to face and exhibiting the virtues you want to learn. You’ll
probably find it more helpful to picture yourself improving in small
increments rather than immediately mastering the whole situation. That’s
known as the benefit of “coping imagery” over “mastery imagery.” Don’t
try to run before you can walk by setting unrealistic goals. Just rehearse a
few simple changes in your behavior to get started. Small changes can often
have big consequences anyway.
When teaching people to employ Stoic practices, I’ve found it helpful to
have a simple framework for daily Stoic practices. It involves a “learning
cycle” with a beginning, middle, and end, which then repeats each day. In
the morning you prepare for the day ahead; throughout the day you try to
live consistently in accord with your values; and in the evening you review
your progress and prepare to repeat the cycle again the next day. I’ll refer to
the Stoic exercises used at the beginning and end of each day as the
morning and evening meditations. Having a daily routine like this makes it
much easier to be consistent in your practice.
This framework also fits in neatly with our discussion of modeling and
mentoring. During your morning meditation, consider what tasks you have
to complete and what challenges you must overcome. Ask yourself, “What
would my role model do?” and try to imagine them dealing with the same

situations you’re about to face. Mentally rehearse the virtues you want to
exhibit. Throughout the day, try continually to be self-aware, as if a wise
mentor or teacher is observing you. We call this “Stoic mindfulness” today,
but the Stoics meant something similar by prosoche, or paying attention to
yourself. Keep an eye on how you use your mind and body, particularly the
value judgments you make in different situations, and watch out for subtle
feelings of anger, fear, sadness, or unhealthy desires, as well as bad habits.
During your evening meditation, review how things actually went,
perhaps going over the key events of the day two or three times in your
mind’s eye. What would your imaginary mentors say? What advice might
they give you about doing things differently next time? This is your
opportunity to learn from experience and prepare for the morning, when
you’ll plan your behavior and rehearse things again in an ongoing cycle of
self-improvement. You might ask yourself, for example, “What would
Marcus Aurelius say about how I fared today?”
The ancients did something similar. Galen said that his own daily routine
involved contemplating a famous poem about philosophy called “The
Golden Verses of Pythagoras.” Seneca and Epictetus mention it as well, and
it may have influenced other Stoics. Galen recommends reading its verses
twice, first silently and then aloud. He suggests that we call to mind each
day the areas for improvement that our mentor has helped us identify. We
should do this as frequently as possible but at the very least, he says, “at
dawn, before we begin our daily tasks, and toward evening, before we are
about to rest.”
Regarding the morning meditation, Galen says that as soon as you rise
from bed and begin considering each of the tasks ahead, you should ask
yourself two questions:
1. What would the consequences be if you acted as a slave to your
passions?
2. How would your day differ if you acted more rationally,
exhibiting wisdom and self-discipline?
Marcus discusses how to prepare for the day ahead at least four times in
The Meditations. He mentions that the Pythagoreans used to contemplate

the stars each morning, thinking of their consistency, purity, and nakedness
as symbolic of man living with wisdom, virtue, and simplicity. He likewise
tells himself on awakening that he is rising to fulfill his potential for
wisdom and not just to be a puppet of bodily sensations, swayed by pleasant
feelings or turned aside by discomfort. He tells himself to love his nature
and his capacity for reason, and to do his best to live accordingly. As we’ll
see later, he also gives himself very specific advice about how to deal with
difficult people without becoming frustrated or resentful.26
This famous passage from “The Golden Verses,” which Epictetus quoted
to his students, describes the evening meditation:
Allow not sleep to close your wearied eyes,
Until you have reckoned up each daytime deed:
“Where did I go wrong? What did I do? And what duty’s left
undone?”
From first to last review your acts and then
Reprove yourself for wretched acts, but rejoice in those done well.27
You can ask yourself these three very simple questions:
1. What did you do badly? Did you allow yourself to be ruled by
irrational fears or unhealthy desires? Did you act badly or allow
yourself to indulge in irrational thoughts?
2. What did you do well? Did you make progress by acting wisely?
Praise yourself and reinforce what you want to repeat.
3. What could you do differently? Did you omit any opportunities to
exercise virtue or strength of character? How could you have
handled things better?
As we’ve seen, young Stoics being observed or questioned by a trusted
mentor became deeply mindful of their thoughts and actions. To some
extent, knowing that you are going to cross-examine yourself at the end of
the day can have a similar effect. It forces you to pay more attention to your
conduct throughout the day. Marcus reminded himself of a pithy saying
from Heraclitus: “We ought not to act and speak as if we were asleep.”28 We

need to make an effort to awaken our self-awareness, in other words.
Following this daily routine, in a sense, helps us to do that by acting like a
mentor to ourselves.
This regimen will make you more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and
actions. You can also foster self-awareness by questioning yourself
regularly throughout the day in the way the Stoics describe. For example,
Marcus frequently examines his own character and actions, perhaps posing
the sort of questions a Stoic mentor might have asked. He asks himself, in
different situations, “What use am I now making of my soul?”29 He probed
his own mind, scrutinizing the fundamental values he was taking for
granted. “Whose soul do I now have?” he would ask. “Am I behaving like a
child, a tyrant, a sheep, a wolf, or am I fulfilling my true potential as a
rational being? For what purpose am I currently using my mind? Am I
being foolish? Am I alienated from other people? Am I letting myself be
dragged off course by fear and desire? What passions are there right now in
my mind?” You might also ask yourself, “How’s this actually working
out?” Sometimes it’s necessary to interrupt the things you’re doing out of
habit so that you can ask yourself whether they’re actually healthy or
unhealthy for you in the long run.
The Stoics employed the Socratic method of questioning, the elenchus,
which exposes contradictions in the beliefs of the person being questioned
—a bit like the cross-examination of a witness in a court of law. They
believed above all that the wise man is consistent in both his thoughts and
actions. Foolish people, by contrast, vacillate, driven by contradictory
passions, which flutter from one thing to another like butterflies. That’s why
we often hear the Stoics praising the wise man for remaining “the same” no
matter what he faces—even his facial expression and demeanor remain
consistent come rain or shine. Marcus quite probably underwent this sort of
questioning from Rusticus and his other Stoic tutors as part of the Stoic
therapy. One of the main things it tends to highlight is any contradiction
between the values we use to guide our own lives, or the things we desire,
and the values we use to judge other people, or what we find praiseworthy
and blameworthy. Therapists today would call this a “double standard.”

This sort of Socratic questioning forms part of an approach called
“values clarification,” which has been around since the 1970s but has
recently gone through a resurgence of popularity among therapists and
researchers.30 By deeply reflecting on our values each day and attempting to
describe them concisely, we can develop a clearer sense of direction in life.
You might do this by posing questions to yourself such as:
• What’s ultimately the most important thing in life to you?
• What do you really want your life to stand for or represent?
• What do you want to be remembered for after you’re dead?
• What sort of person do you most want to be in life?
• What sort of character do you want to have?
• What would you want written on your tombstone?
These questions are similar to the well-known therapy technique of
imagining the eulogies at your own funeral and asking yourself what,
ideally, you would want people to remember you for. Think of Ebenezer
Scrooge in Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, who has a sort of moral epiphany
after the Ghost of Christmas Future confronts him with a troubling vision of
people reacting to his death and tombstone.
Another useful values clarification technique for students of Stoicism
involves making two short lists in side-by-side columns headed “Desired”
and “Admired”:
1. Desired. The things you most desire for yourself in life
2. Admired. The qualities you find most praiseworthy and
admirable in other people
These two lists are, at first, virtually never identical. Why are they
different, and how would your life change if you desired for yourself the
qualities you find admirable in other people? As the Stoics might put it,
what would happen if you were to make virtue your number one priority in
life? The most important aspect of this values clarification exercise for
Stoics would be to grasp the true nature of man’s highest good, to elucidate
our most fundamental goal, and to live accordingly. Everything in Stoicism

ultimately refers back to the goal of grasping the true nature of the good and
living accordingly.
Once you clarify your core values, you can compare them to the Stoic
cardinal virtues of wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation. People find it
surprisingly helpful to set aside even a few minutes per day to reflect deeply
upon their values. Indeed, values clarification has become an integral part
of modern evidence-based treatments for clinical depression. Clarifying our
values and trying to live more consistently in accord with them can help us
gain a greater sense of direction and meaning in life, leading to greater
satisfaction and fulfillment. Try brainstorming small ways in which you can
do things that satisfy your core values each day. Don’t be too ambitious;
just begin with small changes. Then during your evening meditation, you
might literally give yourself “marks out of ten for virtue,” or rather for
living up to your core values. This will encourage you to think more deeply
about ways you can progress toward embodying your values. Remember:
the fundamental goal of life for Stoics, the highest good, is to act
consistently in accord with reason and virtue.
In this chapter we’ve looked at the role Junius Rusticus played in
Marcus’s life as a Stoic tutor and mentor: he persuaded Marcus, as a young
Caesar, that he would benefit from moral training and Stoic therapy of the
passions. We’ve reconstructed an account of Stoic therapy (therapeia)
based on the description given by Marcus’s personal physician, Galen,
which draws on Chrysippus’s lost Therapeutics, and combined this account
with relevant passages from The Meditations.
We’ve also described how to benefit from similar practices today,
whether or not you have a real mentor you can turn to. The mentor’s role
can be seen in terms of modeling both behaviors and attitudes. You can use
different writing and visualization exercises to simulate the Stoic process of
mentoring. We’ve also seen how “The Golden Verses of Pythagoras”
provided Galen, Seneca, and Epictetus with a framework for Stoic therapy
by dividing the day into three stages: morning meditation, mindfulness
during the day, and evening meditation.
We introduced the concept of values clarification from modern therapy.
Reflecting upon and clarifying your core values can help combat depression

and other emotional problems, especially once you make a consistent effort
to live more in accord with your truest values each day. You can compare
these values to the Stoic virtues and explore them from different
perspectives by following the daily routine. Keep coming back to the
question “What’s the most important thing in life?” Or, as the Stoics would
say, “What is the true nature of the good?” Even setting aside a few minutes
each day to clarify your values and do things that are consistent with them
can be very beneficial. Remember: small changes of this kind can often
have surprisingly large effects.
The ideas in this chapter will help you apply the many other Stoic
concepts and techniques that you’re about to learn by providing you with a
framework for your daily practice. This simple “learning cycle” alone,
when used properly, will be enough for many people to see improvements
in their character and emotional resilience, especially combined with their
own reading and study of the Stoic texts. Self-scrutiny of this kind appears
to have been an important aspect of training in ancient Stoicism. As
Socrates said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”

4.
THE CHOICE OF HERCULES

Marcus put his head in his hands and groaned. It wasn’t the devastation
caused by the Antonine Plague or the growing threat of barbarian invasion
from the North that made him despair for the future of Rome. Rather, it was a
party thrown by his brother, Lucius Verus. Lucius and Marcus had always
been quite different characters even though they ruled together, but as the
years passed, their lives grew further apart. Whereas Marcus increasingly
turned to philosophy as his guide, Lucius became notorious for being a
hedonist and something of a hell-raiser.
The family ties of Roman nobles could be convoluted. Lucius was not only
Marcus’s adoptive brother but also his son-in-law, having married Marcus’s
daughter Lucilla. It was therefore said that Marcus looked on him more like a
son than a brother. Upon being acclaimed emperor, Marcus’s first act had
been to have Lucius appointed co-emperor to rule jointly with him, the first
arrangement of its kind in Roman history. Lucius was given Marcus’s family
name, Verus; formerly he had been known as Lucius Aelius Aurelius
Commodus. Lucius was a handsome and charismatic young man who
probably looked more comfortable than Marcus in the purple robes of an
emperor.
[Lucius] Verus was well-proportioned in person and genial of expression. His beard was allowed
to grow long, almost in the style of the barbarians; he was tall, and stately in appearance, for his
forehead projected somewhat over his eyebrows. He took such pride in his yellow hair, it is said,
that he used to sift gold-dust on his head in order that his hair, thus brightened, might seem even
yellower.1

However, although Marcus and Lucius both held the title of emperor,
Lucius was clearly subordinate to Marcus and obeyed him in a manner
comparable to that of a provincial governor or an army lieutenant.
One reason Marcus had appointed a co-emperor was that Lucius arguably
had a claim on the throne: as we’ve seen, Lucius’s natural father died before
he could succeed Hadrian. So it was wise of Marcus to persuade the Senate
that he should share power with his brother in order to avoid the rise of
opposing factions. The Senate feared nothing more than civil war tearing the
empire apart, and this measure helped ensure political stability. The histories
also imply that Marcus’s poor health influenced the decision. As Lucius was
younger by nine years and in much better physical condition, he was primed
to outlive Marcus and become his successor. Joint rule meant, of course, that
if one emperor died suddenly the other would remain in power, reducing the
risk of conflict over the succession.
Moreover, the historian Cassius Dio described Lucius as a younger and
more vigorous man “better suited for military enterprises.” As far as we’re
aware, Lucius never saw any military service as a young man, but at first he
was perhaps more popular with the legions than Marcus. His father had at
least served briefly as governor and military commander of Pannonia. As
soon as Marcus and Lucius were acclaimed as co-emperors, Marcus sent
Lucius to address the legions on his behalf and effectively began treating him
as his representative with the military. Marcus and his advisors obviously had
the impression that Lucius could be a general in the making. He turned out to
be completely useless in this role because he lacked the sense of duty and
self-discipline necessary for military life, preferring instead to spend his time
drinking and entertaining his friends.
Indeed, Lucius was known for his love of extravagant parties, in marked
contrast to his brother. The party that caused Marcus so much concern cost
roughly the equivalent of an entire legion’s annual pay. The main expense
seems to have been the extravagant gifts the Emperor Lucius showered on his
guests. They first received exquisite carving knives and platters and live
animals of the same type as they were eating during each course, a menagerie
of birds and four-legged creatures. Then they were given fine goblets made
from semiprecious stones and Alexandrine crystal. Next, silver, gold, and
jeweled cups, garlands entwined with gold ribbons and out-of-season flowers,

and golden vases containing rare ointments were handed out. The guests were
entertained by private gladiatorial bouts and they drank and played dice until
dawn. Finally, carriages with mules dressed in silver trappings carried them
home; the carriages were theirs to keep, along with the handsome young slave
boys who had been serving them. You can’t buy good friends, though, and the
extravagance attracted a retinue of greedy and dissolute hangers-on who
encouraged the worst aspects of Lucius’s character.
The Historia Augusta paints Lucius in a very negative light overall, as a
vain and self-indulgent buffoon. The picture painted of Lucius contrasts
dramatically with that of Marcus as a bona fide Stoic. Even if the stories
exaggerate Lucius’s vices, there’s probably at least a grain of truth in them.
For instance, despite ruling as Marcus’s co-emperor for nearly a decade,
Lucius is virtually relegated to a footnote in The Meditations. Marcus says
only that he’s grateful for having had a brother “who by his character was able
to stimulate me to cultivate my own nature, and yet at the same time
heartened me by his respect and affection,” perhaps damning Lucius with
faint praise.2 Marcus speaks with artful vagueness here but perhaps meant that
he became more determined to strengthen his own character after observing
his brother’s vices spiraling out of control. However, Marcus was relieved
that Lucius remained loyal to him, showing “respect and affection” rather
than dividing the empire by siding with those who opposed his rule. We can
tell that this was a very real danger from the civil war instigated against
Marcus six years after Lucius’s death by his most celebrated general, Avidius
Cassius.
In their youth, Marcus and Lucius both shared a love of hunting, wrestling,
and other active pursuits, and both trained in Stoic philosophy. However,
whereas Marcus increasingly dedicated himself to the study of rhetoric and
philosophy and diligently worked his way up through ascending roles in
public office, Lucius seems to have done very little except enjoy a life of
leisure. While the younger brother was at the chariot races, gladiatorial
games, or banquets with his friends, Marcus was poring over books, gaining
crucial knowledge of Roman law and the bureaucracy of government. You
could say Lucius chose pleasure before work; Marcus, work before pleasure.
My interpretation is that Lucius organized his whole life around the pursuit
of empty pleasures as a form of emotional avoidance. Psychologists now

know that people often engage in habits they consider pleasurable—from
social media to crack cocaine—as a way of distracting themselves from or
suppressing unpleasant feelings. In Lucius’s case, alcohol and other
diversions perhaps offered him a way to escape worry about his
responsibilities as emperor. As we’ll see, there’s nothing wrong with pleasure
unless we begin craving it so much that we neglect our responsibilities in life
or it replaces healthy and fulfilling activities with ones that are not.
Chasing empty, transient pleasures can never lead to true happiness in the
long run. However, pleasure can be tricky—it can lure us in by posing as
something it’s not. What we’re all really seeking in life is the sense of
authentic happiness or fulfillment the Stoics called eudaimonia. Lucius,
though, was looking for it in entirely the wrong places: cheering on the
carnage of the arena, heaping lavish gifts on dubious friends, and drinking
himself into oblivion. Of course, the banqueting habits of a decadent Roman
emperor might seem an extreme example of someone allowing their
hedonistic urges free rein. However, the basic psychology of desire isn’t much
different today. People still confuse pleasure with happiness and often find it
difficult to imagine another perspective on life. By contrast, the Stoics taught
Marcus that we all seek a deeper and more lasting sense of fulfillment. They
taught him that this could only be obtained by realizing our inner potential
and living in accord with our core values, not being led astray by superficial
feelings. Marcus’s and Lucius’s lives diverged in this regard until they were
heading in quite opposite directions.
There’s something strangely familiar about this tale: the opposing paths
our two young Caesars found themselves on as co-emperors could have been
lifted from a moral fable. Indeed, while attending the lectures of Apollonius
and other Stoics, Marcus must surely have thought of his brother as he
listened attentively to their many exhortations to embrace philosophy as a
way of life. One of the most famous of these was known as “The Choice of
Hercules.” This ancient allegory about choosing our path in life plays a
special role in the history of Stoicism. The story goes that by chance, shortly
after his shipwreck, Zeno had picked up and read the second book of
Xenophon’s Memorabilia. It portrays Socrates arguing that the virtue of selfcontrol makes men noble and good, whereas pursuing a life of pleasure does
not. Socrates begins by quoting a well-known verse from Hesiod:

Wickedness can be had in abundance easily: smooth is the road and very nigh she dwells. But in
front of virtue the gods immortal have put sweat: long and steep is the path to her and rough at
first; but when you reach the top, then at length the road is easy, hard though it was.

Socrates then goes on to recount “The Choice of Hercules,” which he had
learned from Prodicus of Ceos, one of the most highly regarded Greek
Sophists.
One day, as a young man, Hercules was walking along an unfamiliar path
when he came upon a fork in the road, at which he sat down and began to
contemplate his future. Unsure which path to take, he found himself suddenly
confronted by two mysterious goddesses. The first appeared as a beautiful and
alluring woman dressed in fine clothing. She was called Kakia, although she
(falsely) claimed that her friends called her Eudaimonia, meaning happiness
and fulfillment. She barged in front of her companion and pleaded very
insistently with Hercules to follow her path. It led, she promised, to by far the
easiest and most pleasant way of life, a shortcut to true happiness. She told
him that he could live like a king, avoiding hardship and enjoying luxury
beyond most men’s wildest dreams, all delivered to him through the labor of
others.
After listening to her for a while, Hercules was approached by the second
goddess, Arete, a less boastful and more modest woman, who nonetheless
shone with natural beauty. To his surprise, she wore a grave expression. She
warned him that her path led in a very different direction: it would be long
and difficult, and would require a great deal of hard work. Speaking plainly,
she told Hercules that he would suffer. He would be doomed to walk the earth
in rags, reviled and persecuted by his enemies. “Nothing that is really good
and admirable,” cautioned Arete, “is granted by the gods to men without some
effort and application.” Hercules would be called upon to exercise wisdom
and justice and to face mounting adversity with bravery and self-discipline.
Overcoming great obstacles through courageous and honorable deeds, the
goddess said, was the only true path to fulfillment in life.
Hercules famously chose the heroic path of Arete, or “Virtue,” and was not
seduced by Kakia, or “Vice.” Armed with a wooden club and dressed in the
pelt of the Nemean lion, symbolic of a more primitive and natural way of life,
he wandered from one place to another, as if the whole world were his home.
The gods forced him to undertake the legendary Twelve Labors, including

slaying the Hydra and ultimately entering Hades, the Underworld itself, to
capture Cerberus with his bare hands. He died in extreme agony, betrayed by
his jealous wife, who tricked him into wearing a robe soaked in blood
contaminated with the Hydra’s poison. However, Zeus was so impressed by
his mortal son’s greatness of soul that he granted him an apotheosis, elevating
him to the status of a god in his own right.
Not surprisingly, Hercules was the mythic hero most admired by Cynic and
Stoic philosophers. His labors embodied their belief that it’s more rewarding
to face hardship voluntarily and cultivate strength of character than to take the
easy option by embracing comfortable living and idleness. Hence, the satirist
Lucian, a contemporary of Marcus, portrayed the legendary sale of Diogenes
the Cynic at a slave auction as follows:
BUYER: Is there anyone whom you strive to emulate?
DIOGENES: Yes, Hercules.
BUYER: Then why aren’t you wearing a lion-skin? Though I’ll admit that your club looks like his.
DIOGENES: Why, this old cloak is my lion-skin, and like him I’m fighting a campaign against
pleasure, not at anyone else’s bidding, but of my own free will, since I’ve made it my purpose
to clean up human life.3

Like the Cynics before them, the Stoics saw the myth of Hercules as an
allegory about the virtues of courage and self-discipline. “What do you think
Hercules would have amounted to,” Epictetus asks his students, “if there had
not been monsters such as the Nemean lion, the Hydra, the stag of Artemis,
the Erymanthian boar, and all those unjust and bestial men for him to contend
with? Why, if he had sat at home, wrapped up asleep in bedsheets, living in
luxury and ease, he would have been no Hercules at all!”4 Epictetus tells his
students that just as Hercules cleansed the earth of monsters—without
complaining—they should set about conquering themselves by purging the
base desires and emotions from their hearts.
For Stoics, in other words, the tale of Hercules symbolizes the epic
challenge of deciding who we really want to be in life, the promise of
philosophy, and the temptation of giving in to pleasure and vice. The moral is
that it often requires a Herculean effort to keep to the right path. But wasn’t
Hercules’s life unpleasant? As we’ll see, from the Stoic perspective Hercules
remained cheerful, despite the terrible things he endured. He enjoyed a
profound sense of inner satisfaction knowing that he was fulfilling his destiny

and expressing his true nature. His life had something far more satisfying than
pleasure: it had purpose.
All of this must have been familiar to Marcus and Lucius from the
education they received in Stoicism. Lucius gradually lost interest, though,
and turned his back on philosophy. Indeed, while Marcus was busy studying
and tirelessly engaged in public office, Lucius was gaining notoriety for his
debauchery and his growing infatuation with popular Roman spectator sports.
He got himself in hot water by siding with the Greens at the races and thereby
offending fans of rival teams, particularly the Blues. He took a golden statue
of the Greens’ most prized horse, Volucer, everywhere he went. He also had
an enormous crystal wine goblet made that he named in its honor, which
“surpassed the capacity of any human draught,” another testament to his
notoriety for binge drinking.
By contrast, Marcus, like Hercules in the fable, chose to avoid these sorts
of distractions, or at least keep them to a minimum. The unnamed slave from
whom he learned so much as a child had wisely counseled him not to take the
side of the Greens or the Blues in the chariot races or back different factions
in the gladiatorial lists. These were the main forms of public entertainment in
imperial Rome, and it seems the “masses” were just as addicted to them as
many of us are to spectator sports and reality television today.
Marcus came to loathe all such public events, but he was obliged to attend
them at the insistence of his friends and advisors. He seems to have found
unnecessary bloodshed vicious and barbaric. Indeed, as emperor, Marcus
began to impose many restrictions on the cruelty of the games. He insisted
that the gladiators before him use blunted weapons so that they would be
fighting like athletes, without any risk to their lives. The thrill of the chariot
races was likewise about bloodlust, as horses and charioteers were frequently
maimed or killed in this dangerous sport. Marcus tried to see beyond the
excitement of the crowd. He adopted a more philosophical attitude to the
events unfolding before his eyes, asking himself, Is this really what people
consider fun?
For Stoics, feelings of pleasure in themselves are neither good nor bad.
Rather, whether our state of mind is good or bad, healthy or unhealthy,
depends on the things we take enjoyment in. Marcus compares Roman society
to the idle pageantry of a procession, where people seem distracted by

trivialities, but he reminds himself that he must take his place in it with good
grace. Nevertheless, a man’s worth can be measured by the things upon which
he sets his heart.5 Enjoying the suffering of others is bad. Taking pleasure in
watching men risk death or serious injury would therefore be considered a
vice by the Stoics. In contrast, enjoying seeing people flourish is good. You
might think that’s obvious; however, we can be blinded by pleasure to its
consequences for both others and ourselves. Marcus had been taught by his
Stoic tutors to examine the sources and consequences of pleasure very closely.
He was therefore able, to some extent, to see beyond the prejudices of his own
culture. We should likewise learn to enjoy things that are good for us and
others, not things that are bad for us. Indeed, there’s a type of inner
gratification that comes from living consistently in accord with our deepest
values, which can make ordinary pleasures feel superficial by comparison.
Marcus has that in mind when he repeatedly tells himself that the goal of his
life is not pleasure but action.
At first the people ridiculed Marcus as a snob and a bore because at the
games they could see that he was reading legal documents and discussing
them with his advisors. He’d been told that he had to show his face at these
events to keep the crowds happy, but he wanted to use the time to address the
serious business of running the state. Even his tutor and close friend, Fronto,
denounced him for being too serious:
On occasion, in your absence, I have criticized you in quite severe terms in front of a small circle
of my most intimate friends. There was a time when I would do so, for instance, when you entered
public gatherings with a more gloomy expression than was fitting, or pored over a book at the
theatre or during a banquet (I am speaking of a time when I myself did not yet keep away from
theatres and banquets). On such occasions, then, I would call you an insensitive man who failed to
act as circumstances demanded, or sometimes even, in an impulse of anger, a disagreeable
person.6

Fronto came around to Marcus’s way of thinking in the end. He gradually
realized that there was more to life than socializing among the Roman
patrician class, whom they both came to view as lacking any genuine warmth
or friendliness. Marcus also faced criticism from the old guard for promoting
men such as his future son-in-law Pompeianus based on merit rather than
nobility of birth. He picked his friends carefully, based on the character traits
he most admired rather than what seemed congenial to those of his social

class. His friends’ company wasn’t always fun—sometimes they spoke
plainly and criticized him—but he embraced them because they shared his
values and helped to improve him as a person. He clearly preferred the
company of his family and most trusted friends over socializing with the
Roman elite. He admits in The Meditations that he craves the simpler but
idyllic family life at his peaceful villas in the Italian countryside. Although
this was undoubtedly a healthier and more modest way to spend his leisure
time compared with Lucius’s riotous banqueting, it was nevertheless a
yearning Marcus would soon have to set aside, when the Marcomannic Wars
required him to leave Rome for the northern frontier.
Though Marcus shrewdly put away his papers at the amphitheater, he still
insisted on working. While he discussed political decisions with his advisors,
onlookers assumed he was chatting with them about the games like everyone
else. He even found ways to glean life lessons from the games. In wild beast
fights he observed gladiators, half eaten and covered with wounds, begging to
be patched up so they could throw themselves back into the fight. This
reminded Marcus of the way we continue to give in to unhealthy desires
despite knowing the harm they do us. Perhaps it also reminded him of his
brother, who had abandoned philosophy and embraced a life of debauchery
that was clearly destroying him.
Marcus kept Lucius somewhat in check as long as they were together.
However, shortly after the two brothers were acclaimed as co-emperors, the
Parthian king Vologases IV invaded the Roman client-state of Armenia. The
governor of nearby Cappadocia (in modern-day Turkey) rushed to engage the
enemy, but his legion was surrounded and annihilated. He was forced to take
his own life. This was a humiliating defeat for the Romans, and the conflict
rapidly escalated into a major military crisis.
Marcus’s presence was still required at Rome, so he sent Lucius to Syria to
take command of the troops massed in the East. However, a journey that
should have taken a few weeks ended up taking nine months. The histories
allege that Lucius wasted his time hunting and partying along the way.
Marcus accompanied him as far as Capua, in southern Italy, before he had to
turn back to Rome. As soon as his older brother was gone, Lucius “gorged
himself in everyone’s villa” until he became so ill that Marcus had to rush to
attend to him at nearby Canusium. Pleasures, as we’ve seen, can blind us to

their consequences if we’re not careful. Lucius’s overindulgence would
increasingly lead him to neglect both his own welfare and that of the empire.
The Historia Augusta deals harshly with the Emperor Lucius, complaining
that when he finally reached Syria, and throughout the course of the Parthian
War, away from Marcus’s supervision, the weaker and more degenerate
features of his character prevailed.
For while a legate [a Roman general] was being slain, while legions were being slaughtered, while
Syria meditated revolt, and the East was being devastated, [Lucius] Verus was hunting in Apulia,
travelling about through Athens and Corinth accompanied by orchestras and singers, and dallying
through all the cities of Asia that bordered on the sea, and those cities of Pamphylia and Cilicia
that were particularly notorious for their pleasure-resorts.

When Lucius eventually reached Antioch, the capital of Syria, far from
Marcus’s gaze, he gave himself over entirely to riotous living. He also shaved
off his beard to humor his mistress, Panthea. This confirmed that he was
turning his back on philosophy once and for all in order to pursue a more selfindulgent lifestyle. The philosopher’s beard had become a surprisingly
politicized symbol after years of persecution under previous regimes; for
some, at least, shaving it off implied abandoning one’s most cherished beliefs
and values. A few generations earlier, presumably speaking of Emperor
Domitian’s persecution of philosophers, Epictetus had defiantly exclaimed
that if the authorities wanted to cut off his beard, they’d have to cut off his
head first.
Marcus had already sent the Roman general Avidius Cassius, a notoriously
strict disciplinarian, to take command of the troops in Syria, dragging the
dissolute eastern legionaries out of the brothels and drinking houses and
knocking the flowers from their hair. No sooner had Lucius arrived to take
command, though, than his personal entourage took the place of soldiers in
the fleshpots and resorts of the East. The gossip was that Lucius indulged in
numerous adulterous love affairs with women and young men in Syria, even
though he was married to Marcus’s young daughter, Lucilla. It was there that
he picked up the habit of playing dice until dawn. He wandered through
taverns and brothels late at night disguised as a commoner, it’s said, getting
drunk, ending up in fights, and coming home black and blue. When he was
out drinking he liked to smash the cups in the cookshops by throwing coins at

them, which presumably started a few brawls. He’d get so inebriated after
feasting through the night that he’d typically fall asleep at the banqueting
table and have to be carried to his bedroom by the servants.
Indeed, Lucius was notorious for being a heavy drinker. Based on the
available information, it seems possible he suffered from alcoholism,
accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and depression. During the Parthian
War, for example, he wrote to Fronto complaining in desperation of “the
anxieties that have rendered me very miserable day and night, and almost
made me think that everything was ruined.” He’s probably referring to
problems negotiating with the hostile Parthians, but he was clearly
overwhelmed by emotional distress. Binge drinking, casual sex, gambling,
and partying became his way of coping, albeit badly, with the pressures of his
role. The Stoics believed that entertainment, sex, food, and even alcohol have
their place in life—they’re neither good nor bad in themselves. However,
when pursued excessively, they can become unhealthy. So the wise man sets
reasonable limits on his desires, and he exercises the virtue of moderation:
“Nothing in excess.” When doing what feels pleasurable becomes more
important than doing what’s actually good for us or our loved ones, though,
that’s a recipe for disaster. There’s a world of difference between healthy
pleasures and unhealthy ones. Lucius had definitely crossed that line.
After the Romans secured victory over the Parthians following six years of
war, Lucius finally returned from Syria to celebrate his triumph with Marcus.
However, once back at Rome, he paid even less regard to his older brother,
and his behavior continued to degenerate. People scoffed that he must have
been taking actors prisoner rather than Parthian soldiers because he proudly
brought back so many from the East. Nevertheless, Lucius shamelessly
invited Fronto, a great rhetorician, to write a history of the war giving Lucius
credit for all Rome’s achievements. The truth was that Lucius had left Avidius
Cassius and his other generals in command and stayed as far away from the
action as possible, touring the region like a celebrity with his entourage of
hangers-on. As we’ll see, this negligence was no small matter. Avidius
Cassius was able to step into his shoes and gradually became almost as
powerful as an emperor himself throughout the eastern provinces.
Lucius hadn’t been home long, though, before the First Marcomannic War
broke out along the northern frontier. This time both emperors rode out from

Rome together in their military attire. Marcus evidently didn’t think it was a
good idea for his brother to go alone, and he didn’t feel comfortable leaving
him back at Rome unsupervised. Lucius wanted to remain at Aquileia, in
northern Italy, where he could hunt and banquet, but Marcus insisted they
needed to cross the Alps to Pannonia, which had been overrun by the
Marcomanni and their allies. After the Romans repulsed the initial barbarian
incursion, the co-emperors returned to Aquileia at Lucius’s insistence because
he yearned to be near Rome. However, in early 169 AD, Lucius was struck
with a sudden fainting spell, and he died three days later after being bled by
his physicians. We can’t be sure what killed him. There were even rumors
Marcus had him poisoned. However, his loss of consciousness, inability to
speak, and sudden death are signs of the plague, which was prevalent in
nearby cities and legionary camps around this time. Ironically, despite
Lucius’s reputation as the younger and hardier of the two co-emperors, he
only made it to age thirty-nine, while Marcus, with his notorious frailty,
reached nearly sixty.
We might think Marcus was relieved to be rid of his wayward brother, but
he probably felt his loss greatly. It came at a time of mounting crises, as
disease spread throughout the empire and Marcus was forced to leave Rome
for the first time to take up his command on the northern frontier. He must
have felt increasingly isolated, in great personal danger, and under a
tremendous amount of political pressure. As we’ll see, though, it was within
this crucible that The Meditations took shape.
HOW TO CONQUER DESIRE
We mentioned Prodicus’s “Choice of Hercules” earlier, but Marcus cites
another famous allegory about desire in his notes. It’s one of Aesop’s fables,
called “The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse.” A town mouse once
visited his cousin in the countryside, where he was welcomed with a simple
meal of rustic food: a crust of bread and some dry oats. However, the town
mouse laughed at his cousin’s unsophisticated tastes and peasant fare.
Boasting of the luxury and abundance to be found in the town, he insists that
the country mouse come back to the city with him for a taste of the good life.
The country mouse agrees, and they return to the house where the town

mouse lives hidden to feast like kings upon the finest scraps from the owner’s
table. However, two dogs hear them scratching around and come hurtling into
the room barking, which sends the mice scurrying for cover in fear for their
lives.
Once they’ve reached the safety of a mouse hole and caught their breath,
the shaken country mouse thanks his cousin for his hospitality but says he’ll
be returning to his humble rural dwelling right away. Although the country
fare is modest, he prefers the peace and quiet of his own home and a simple
life to the dangers of the city. The town mouse’s perilous habits aren’t really
the good life at all. They come at too high a cost. The country mouse says he
would rather dine like a peasant than risk being eaten alive by ravenous dogs.
Reflecting on the moral of this story, Marcus calls to mind “the alarm and
trepidation” with which the town mouse perpetually lives because of his
greed.7 I can’t help but think that Marcus Aurelius saw himself as the country
mouse and his brother Lucius as the town mouse.
Just because Marcus saw the “pleasures” that ensnared Lucius as empty
and superficial doesn’t mean there was no joy in his own life. We shouldn’t be
fooled by the gravity of The Meditations, which consists of semiformal
exercises, into thinking that the author had a gloomy personality. His private
letters prove that Marcus was a good-humored and surprisingly affectionate
man who spent his youth enjoying a wide variety of sports and hobbies. He
liked painting, boxing, wrestling, running, fowling, and boar hunting, and the
Historia Augusta adds that he was very skilled at playing various ball games.
Of course, as the years passed and his responsibilities increased, he dedicated
his life to handling the affairs of state and to his training in Stoic philosophy,
which helped guide his actions. However, we’re told he was loved by those
close to him and seemed pleasant and approachable to others. He was
described as austere but not excessively so, humble but not passive, and
serious but never gloomy. He clearly took great pleasure in the company of
his friends and family.
Marcus was probably a much happier man than his hedonistic brother
Lucius was. True, he didn’t experience the highs of all the wild parties Lucius
threw, but neither did he suffer the lows, the painful consequences of
overindulgence. What he gained instead was the more profound and lasting
happiness that the Stoics claimed was the result of living in accord with

wisdom and virtue, or at least some glimmer of that ideal state. Indeed, he
made it clear that his goal was to achieve the utmost joy in his heart and
maintain a “cheerful serenity” throughout the whole of his life. Having
glimpsed this inner peace, Marcus was convinced that it was possible to live
consistently in that state of mind, even if he was criticized by those around
him or was gored by wild beasts.8 Socrates himself had remained cheerful
while in prison awaiting his execution, and even as he raised the hemlock cup
to his lips. At least that was the story. However, Marcus also saw this healthy
attitude of cheerfulness in the face of adversity with his own eyes, as
exhibited by his beloved Stoic tutors. They had taught the young Marcus that
inner calm and happiness are the natural consequences of a life lived well, in
accord with genuine wisdom and self-discipline. More importantly, though, he
had witnessed evidence of this being their actual way of life, embodied in the
actions of these great men even in the face of terrible adversity.
Modern English isn’t well equipped to capture some of the distinctions
made in ancient Greek philosophy, especially when it comes to describing
emotions and sensations. We use the word “pleasure” very broadly to
encompass almost any positive feeling. However, the Stoics distinguished
between the sort of pleasure (hedone) we get from “external” things like food
or sex or flattery and the deeper sense of inner joy (chara) that Marcus is
talking about. Stoic joy is profound. It comes from achieving your
fundamental goal in life and experiencing genuine fulfillment, which make
ordinary pleasures seem trivial by comparison. Ordinary pleasures often ruffle
our minds, especially when indulged in too much. Stoic joy never does this—
it’s synonymous with inner peace and knows no excess.9 The Stoics refer to it
as the pure form of “joy” that someone experiences who is living a truly great
life and has attained genuine personal fulfillment (eudaimonia). Of course,
none of us are there yet, but all of us may, potentially, glimpse the goal as
long as we’re heading in the right direction.
There are two more key points about Stoic joy worth emphasizing:
1. The Stoics tended to view joy not as the goal of life, which is
wisdom, but as a by-product of it, so they believed that trying to
pursue it directly might lead us down the wrong path if it’s sought at
the expense of wisdom.

2. Joy in the Stoic sense is fundamentally active rather than passive; it
comes from perceiving the virtuous quality of our own deeds, the
things we do, whereas bodily pleasures arise from experiences that
happen to us, even if they’re a consequence of actions like eating,
drinking, or having sex.
Marcus therefore says that it’s not in feelings but in actions that your
supreme good resides.10
The wise man’s sense of delight comes from one thing alone: acting
consistently in accord with virtue.11 Nevertheless, Marcus does elsewhere
mention two additional sources of joy. Together these correspond with the
three core relationships that Stoic ethics encompassed: our self, other people,
and the world as a whole.
1. Contemplating virtue in yourself. As we’ve just seen, Marcus says
that the most important source of both “serenity” and “joy” for a
Stoic comes from letting go of attachment to external things and
focusing on living wisely, particularly by exercising virtue (justice)
in our relations with others.
2. Contemplating virtue in others. Marcus also tells himself that
when he wants to gladden his heart, he should meditate on the good
qualities of those close to him, such as energy, modesty, or
generosity. That’s essentially what he’s doing in book 1 of The
Meditations when he lists the virtues of his family members and
teachers at length, and it helps to explain the important role of these
friendships in his life.
3. Welcoming your fate. Marcus also tells himself that rather than
desiring things that are absent, as many do, he should reflect on the
pleasant aspects of things he already has before him and
contemplate how he would miss them if they were not there.12
The Greek word for joy (chara) is closely related to that for gratitude
(charis). Indeed, the Stoics encourage you to appreciate the external things
Fortune has given you. Marcus cautions, however, that you must exercise
moderation in this regard. You should not fall into the habit of overvaluing
external things and becoming overly attached to them. You can check this, he

says, by asking yourself whether you would be upset if the things you value
were ever taken away. The Stoics wanted to develop a healthy sense of
gratitude in life, unspoiled by attachment. So they practiced calmly imagining
change and loss, like a river gently flowing past, carrying things away. The
wise man loves life and is grateful for the opportunities it gives him, but he
accepts that everything changes and nothing lasts forever. Marcus therefore
wrote that it is a characteristic of the Stoic Sage “to love and welcome all that
happens to him and is spun for him as his fate.”13 People today often feel that
this is similar to a famous Latin phrase coined by the nineteenth-century
German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: amor fati, or love of one’s fate.
The Stoics emphasize gratitude, but they also accept that there’s nothing
wrong with taking pleasure in healthy experiences, as long as it’s not carried
to excess. As mentioned earlier, they certainly didn’t think that pleasurable
experiences were a bad thing. Rather, pleasure, and its sources, is morally
“indifferent,” neither good nor bad.
In other words, the Stoics weren’t killjoys. Marcus was convinced he could
obtain as much healthy enjoyment from the simple things that befell him in
life as pleasure-seekers like his brother did from ravenously indulging their
unhealthy desires.14 Socrates had likewise claimed, paradoxically, that those
who practice self-control actually obtain more pleasure from things like food
and drink than those who indulge in them to excess. Hunger is the best relish,
he said, whereas if we overeat we spoil our appetites. Hedonists might accuse
Stoics of missing out on life’s pleasures, but Stoics would respond with this
paradox: the life of someone like Marcus, who exercises moderation, is surely
more pleasant and involves less self-inflicted suffering than the life of
someone like Lucius, who lacks self-control and indulges himself far too
much.
However, an even deeper paradox lies in the notion that, ultimately, the
virtue of self-discipline itself might become a greater source of “pleasure”
than food or other external objects of our desire. More accurately, exercising
moderation may become a source of personal satisfaction and inner
fulfillment that outweighs the ordinary pleasures it seeks to overcome. It’s
important to remember, though, that we’re talking about self-discipline that’s
exercised wisely, not any sort of self-denial that might actually be foolish or
unhealthy. For Stoics the intrinsic value of wisdom, as an end in itself, always

surpasses everything else, including the pleasure and other external benefits
that may accrue as the result of living wisely. Those are more like an added
bonus than the real goal of life.
STEPS FOR CHANGING DESIRES
So how do you get rid of unhealthy desires and learn to experience greater
fulfillment in life, like the Stoics describe? Most of us find ourselves seeking
hedonistic pleasures and indulging in bad habits that can seem difficult to
break. Of course, in cases of genuine addiction to drugs or alcohol, you
should seek professional advice. However, psychologists working in the
1970s developed reliable ways of changing ordinary habits and cravings.
These methods are still being applied by therapists today to issues like
snacking on unhealthy foods or fingernail biting. Some of our most persistent
habits may be ways of avoiding unpleasant feelings, which leave deeper
problems unresolved. However, spending too much time chasing empty
pleasures can also prevent us from pursuing activities that we may find
genuinely rewarding, such as living more fully in alignment with our core
values. Arguably, that’s the most serious problem of all.
For example, people today often complain that they feel “addicted” to
social media. They spend many hours online checking messages out of a kind
of habit or compulsion, feeling agitated, bored, or uneasy if they try to abstain
for any length of time. They obsess about social networks, computer games,
television programs, etc., in the same way Lucius did about chariot races and
gladiatorial bouts. On reflection, though, few would conclude that this is the
most fulfilling way to spend their lives. Nobody has ever had the words “I
wish I’d watched more television” or “I wish I’d spent more time on
Facebook” engraved on their tombstone. If these empty and passive pleasures
provide no lasting sense of fulfillment or satisfaction, the Stoics would
caution us against spending too much time on them.
In particular, people suffering from clinical depression may find that
unsatisfying pleasures have come to replace the more fulfilling activities that
once gave their lives meaning. They can easily end up becoming forms of
distraction or sources of emotional numbing.

So you should carefully evaluate your habits and desires in terms of the
bigger picture: how much do these pursuits actually contribute to your longterm happiness or sense of fulfillment in life?
I’m going to recommend a simple framework for evaluating and changing
your behavior based on a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and
ancient Stoic practices. It consists of the following steps:
1. Evaluate the consequences of your habits or desires in order to
select which ones to change.
2. Spot early warning signs so that you can nip problematic desires in
the bud.
3. Gain cognitive distance by separating your impressions from
external reality.
4. Do something else instead of engaging in the habit.
In addition, consider how you might introduce other sources of healthy
positive feelings by:
1. Planning new activities that are consistent with your core values.
2. Contemplating the qualities you admire in other people.
3. Practicing gratitude for the things you already have in life.
1. EVALUATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF DESIRES

How do you identify which habits to change? Modern therapists often help
their clients weigh the pros and cons of different courses of action in order to
choose among them. Sometimes this is called a “cost-benefit analysis” or
“functional analysis.” Of course, people with habits they want to break, such
as overeating or smoking, normally say, “I already know this is bad for me!”
Nevertheless, if you’re not sure something is a bad habit or an unhealthy
desire, you should weigh the consequences of following the desire against
those of exercising moderation or doing something else.
For instance, if you regularly watch television for an hour after work, what
are the long-term pros and cons of that habit? What could you do instead that
would be more consistent with your true values in life, and how would that
work out in the long run? Some philosophers, as we’ve seen, claim that the
mere act of exercising moderation could become more gratifying itself than

indulging in bad habits. Alternatively, you may want to do a “substitute
behavior” that’s high on your list of personal values but that might take a little
effort to get done, such as phoning a loved one or reading a book. Remember,
the purpose of this exercise is not just to reduce bad habits but to introduce
more activities that are intrinsically valued and rewarding, like the Stoic
virtues. For instance, if it’s important to you to be a good parent, schedule
activities that allow you to behave in a manner consistent with this value.
Embracing these types of opportunities will help you become more like the
sort of person you want to be in life, even if it’s only for a few minutes each
day at first. What would happen if you spent more time exercising the virtues
you admire, doing things that you find inherently valuable and fulfilling, and
less time indulging in the sort of habits that may feel pleasurable but aren’t
actually good for you?
In fact, really thinking through consequences of behaviors and picturing
them vividly in your mind may be enough in some cases to eliminate the
behavior. Epictetus therefore told his students to envision the consequences of
an action and determine how it would work out for them over time. We can
observe Marcus employing this method, asking himself what each action
means for him and wondering whether he’ll have cause to regret it in the
future.15 As we’ve noted, the Stoics liked to break decisions down into simple
dichotomies. In “The Choice of Hercules,” likewise, there are basically two
paths forward:
1. The path of vice, or following excessive desires and irrational
emotions (unhealthy passions)
2. The path of virtue, or exercising self-discipline and following
reason and your true values in life
The Stoics often reminded themselves of the paradox that unhealthy
emotions such as fear and anger actually do us more harm than the things
we’re upset about. Likewise, learning self-control may ultimately do us more
good than obtaining all the external things we desire. The virtues of courage
and moderation improve our character and our lives in general when they are
exercised wisely, whereas most of the things we crave just give us fleeting
pleasure.

Therapists find it helpful to ask their clients of their habits, “How’s that
working out in the long run?” Often that simple question is enough to
motivate behavior change. However, what we’ll call Stoic “functional
analysis” can be done much more thoroughly on paper. You might write down
the short-term pros and cons of a course of action followed by longer-term
consequences. Simply realizing that your desires produce negative results can
sometimes change the way you feel and behave. Other times, though, you may
need to picture repeatedly the negative effects of bad habits in a very detailed,
clear, and vivid manner in order to change them. You may find it also helps to
picture the positive consequences of refraining from the desire, mastering it,
or doing the opposite of it. It can be helpful to visualize two paths ahead of
you, just like the fork in the road that confronted Hercules: for example,
quitting smoking versus continuing, exercising versus doing nothing. Spend
time picturing how these two paths would grow apart over time, where they
might lead you several months or even years from now.
Your primary goal at this stage is to identify which desires or habits you
want to overcome and to be clear about the consequences of doing so. Your
secondary goal is to boost your motivation by developing a strong sense of
contrast between the two paths ahead of you and the benefits of change.
Motivation is a well-established key to success when it comes to breaking
habits, so it makes sense to begin by doing what you can to boost it. To break
a habit you must have a desire for change. However, it’s possible to increase
your desire for change, so that’s something you should work on.
2. SPOT EARLY WARNING SIGNS

Now that you’ve considered what sort of habits or desires might conflict with
your values and be worth changing, your next step is to “catch them in the
wild” by noticing when they’re actually happening. The key is to spot them
early so that you can nip them in the bud. This requires patient selfmonitoring, especially looking out for the early warning signs of the feelings
or behavior you want to change. When done properly, this sort of selfmonitoring is effectively a form of training in Stoic mindfulness.
Keep a written daily record of the situations in which you notice the desire
emerging. This can be as simple as tallying each time you sense even the
slightest inclination to engage in the habit, the first inkling of the desire. It

could also be a more detailed record sheet, including rows with columns for
the date/time, the external situation (“Where were you?”), the early warning
signs you notice, and/or a rating from zero to ten of the strength of the urge
and possibly also the level of actual pleasure you experienced if you gave in
to it. If you find it helpful, you might also want to record any thoughts you
had that facilitated or excused the desire, such as “Just this once won’t hurt!”
or “I can always stop tomorrow,” or “I just don’t have the willpower.”

Your first goal should be to study yourself and identify the trigger or
“high-risk” situations where the problem tends to arise. Maybe you eat junk
food for comfort on particularly high-stress days at work or after you’ve had a
fight with a loved one. Look for subtle early warning signs of the behavior
that you’d previously overlooked. Become more aware of your thoughts,
actions, and feelings so you can catch the desire emerging at an earlier and
earlier stage. Look out for signs that typically precede the desire. To continue
the junk food example, you may notice that you look at candy in the store and
picture yourself eating it. If you’re a smoker, perhaps you become tense or
fidget when you’re craving a cigarette. Simple things that people do when
engaging in habitual behaviors are hard for them to detect, even though they
may be quite visible to an observer—for instance, the expression on their
face, the look in their eyes, the way they use their hands, and so on. These
early warnings may include the sort of facilitating thoughts mentioned above,
such as “I could do with a treat” or “Just this once won’t hurt.”
Many common habits that people want to quit turn out to be of the handto-face types, such as fingernail biting, smoking, drinking, or snacking on
junk food. People often fidget with their hands before engaging in these
habits, such as stroking their chin just before biting their fingernail. Noticing
these precursors for the first time can often weaken the habit. A Stoic mentor
or a friend you’ve enlisted would be an invaluable asset to you in situations
like this. Instruct the person to bring the habit to your attention with a simple

gesture like tapping their nose and walking away. People often find it very
irritating to be lectured about something they weren’t even aware they were
doing. If you’re working alone, you will need to act as though another person
is carefully observing you and imagine what they might see.
Learning to catch things at an early stage makes it easier to derail the chain
of behaviors that leads to the full desire or passion emerging. Raising
awareness of the subtle elements of a behavior also makes it feel less
automatic. For instance, most adults can tie their own shoelaces automatically,
without thinking about it. However, if you try to teach a child how to do it,
you may find yourself suddenly all thumbs. What was habitual and automatic
when we didn’t think about it often becomes very clumsy and awkward when
we are forced to analyze the steps or do it in a slightly different manner.
That’s unhelpful if you’re performing before an audience or playing a sport,
where thinking too much about your behavior can cause self-consciousness
and disrupt routine actions. Ask someone who’s about to perform a skilled
action, like putting in golf, whether they begin doing it by breathing in or out
—that will often be enough to confuse them and put them off. The same
principle, that self-awareness disrupts the automatic quality of the behavior,
can be very helpful when you actually want to break a bad habit.
3. GAIN COGNITIVE DISTANCE

Once you’ve spotted the early warning signs of a craving or habit, you can
also help yourself change by noticing the separation between your current
perspective and external reality. We’ve already introduced the concept of
cognitive distancing from modern psychotherapy. It provides a way of
understanding one of the most important psychological practices in Stoicism:
that of “separating” our values from external events. When a desire or habit
emerges, you can take note of thoughts that encourage it—“I wonder what’s
happening online”—and also thoughts or excuses that facilitate it—“It won’t
hurt if I just check my social media messages for a second.” Observing these
in a detached way, almost as if they were someone else’s thoughts, will help
you gain cognitive distance and will weaken the urge to act on them. The
Stoics do this, as we’ve seen, in a number of ways. Following them, you
might “apostrophize” the thought, speaking to it as if to another person, and
say, “You are just a thought and not at all the thing you claim to represent”—

the thing itself having no intrinsic value. You might also adapt Epictetus and
say “It’s not things that make us crave them but our judgments about things.”
We are the ones who choose to assign value to things that look appealing.
It’s as though strong desires and feelings of pleasure are telling us “This is
good!” Strong desire makes us forget that there are other ways of viewing the
things we crave. However, pausing and gaining cognitive distance, by
defusing your thoughts from reality, tends to weaken the strength of your
feelings and the hold they have over your behavior.
There are many different ways of gaining cognitive distance. One is to
imagine how a role model might perceive the same situation differently.
Suppose you’re craving a hamburger. You might use the verbal technique of
asking yourself, “What would Socrates do about this desire?” Socrates, as it
happens, was careful about his diet and preferred to eat modestly. He thought
that self-control was more important than pleasure, as we’ve seen, and if we
avoid overeating, we will obtain more enjoyment from our food anyway. You
could also ask, “How would Marcus cope if he had the same sort of
cravings?” Of course, you might prefer to pick a role model of your own,
perhaps someone you know personally, a friend, colleague, or family member,
or even a celebrity or fictional character. First, consider what the role model
you choose would say to themselves about the desire. How would they react
to the initial awareness of the urge? Then consider what they would actually
do. Of course, you don’t have to imitate them, but viewing the experience
from different perspectives can weaken the strength of the feeling. You may
be inspired to problem-solve and think creatively of alternative ways to
respond. On the other hand, when people feel overwhelmed by desires or
emotions, they can often only imagine one way of looking at events.
Marcus also talks about the importance of breaking things down into their
components and reflecting on each part in isolation. The idea is that when we
analyze something in terms of its elements and focus on each in turn, asking
ourselves whether it alone is enough to overwhelm us, the whole experience
will tend to seem more bearable. Similar “divide-and-conquer” techniques are
employed in modern cognitive therapy to overcome problematic desires and
emotions. We may as well borrow the term used by the early twentiethcentury psychotherapist Charles Baudouin, who was influenced by Stoicism,
to describe this psychological technique: “depreciation by analysis.”16 That

means breaking any problem down into small chunks that seem less
emotionally powerful or overwhelming.
For instance, when engaged in certain actions, such as bad habits of the
kind we’ve been discussing, Marcus advised pausing and asking of each step:
“Does death appear terrible because I would be deprived of this?” That gave
him a way of isolating each part of a habit in turn and casting its value in
question.17 For example, someone smoking a cigarette might ask with each
puff whether losing that sensation would really be the end of the world.
Someone compulsively checking social media might stop and ask if not
reading each individual notification would really be so unbearable. If you
practice self-awareness in this way, you’ll often (but not always) realize that
the pleasure you obtain from such habits is actually much less than you
previously assumed.
Marcus led the dance of the Salii, the ancient leaping warrior-priests, and
trained in boxing and wrestling as a youth. He draws on these experiences,
making the astute psychological observation that you can spoil the delights of
song and dance just by pausing to analyze them into their parts—for example,
breaking a melody down into individual notes, in your mind, and asking
yourself of each small part: “Would this be enough to overcome me?”18
Likewise, in the pankration, an ancient sport combining boxing, wrestling,
kicking, and choking, analyzing each of your opponent’s moves individually
can help you learn to overcome them without feeling overwhelmed. Marcus
therefore advised himself to analyze events into their component parts in
order to break the spell of passion.
You’ve already learned about the concept of Stoic indifference, or
apatheia. It has a very specific meaning—freedom from harmful desires or
passions—that the Stoics distinguished from ordinary indifference. It’s not
about being coldhearted or uncaring. Whereas Stoics believed that the only
true good is wisdom and virtue, we tend to slip into the habit of thinking
about external things as if they were more important than fulfilling our own
nature. We’ve seen how the Stoics particularly emphasized suspending value
judgments about external things. They did this by using language to describe
events as objectively as possible. As we’ve seen, they called this firm grip on
reality phantasia kataleptike, or the “objective representation” of events.

You can see how this concept could apply to managing unhealthy desires.
People often talk about the things they crave in language that’s bound to
excite their own desire, even when they realize they’re fostering unhealthy
habits: “I’m dying for some chocolate. Why is it so good? It tastes like
heaven! This is better than sex.” (It’s mainly vegetable fat, some cacao, and a
load of refined sugar.) That’s another example of rhetoric working against
you. On the other hand, when you describe food, or anything else you crave,
in down-to-earth language, you can feel detached from it. Hadrian, who is
thought to have died from a heart attack, greatly admired an extravagant dish
jokingly called the tetrapharmacum, or “fourfold remedy,” reputedly invented
by Lucius Verus’s father. It consisted of pheasant, wild boar, ham, and a sow’s
udder, all wrapped in pastry. By contrast, Marcus would sometimes look at
roasted meats and other delicacies and murmur to himself, “This is a dead
bird, a dead fish, a dead pig.”19 An exquisite wine is just fermented grape
juice, and so on.20 Viewed from a different perspective, in other words, the
things people crave are often nothing to get excited about.
Sometimes these objective representations resemble the notes an ancient
physician or natural philosopher may have made documenting their
observations of physical phenomena. In modern cognitive therapy, we also
suggest that clients think of themselves as scientists, approaching behavior
change as an experiment with an attitude of curiosity, detachment, and
objectivity. Marcus even applied this way of looking at the world to his sex
life. We noted earlier that he had struggled to overcome feelings of anger as a
young man. He also briefly mentions having sexual desires that he considered
it better not to act upon. In book 1 of The Meditations Marcus says that,
looking back, he’s grateful he chose to preserve his sexual innocence for a
few years into his adulthood.21 He’s also thankful that when he was later
troubled by strong sexual cravings, he overcame them and “never touched
Benedicta or Theodotus”—possibly a female and male slave in the household
of his father, the Emperor Antoninus. We can see that Marcus applied
depreciation by analysis to sexual desires. At one point, for instance, he
described sex to himself, perhaps as an ancient physician might, as merely the
rubbing together of body parts followed by a convulsion and the ejaculation
of some mucus.22 Not very romantic, but that’s the point—he was aiming to
neutralize inappropriate sexual urges of the kind he struggled to overcome.

(He had thirteen children, though, so he wasn’t completely opposed to sex.)
The point isn’t to obliterate all desire but rather to moderate unhealthy or
excessive desires, which place too much importance on certain types of
pleasure.
4. DO SOMETHING ELSE

You’ve identified which desires you want to overcome, learned how to spot
their early warning signs, and practiced how to pause and gain distance from
them. In a sense, the best thing to do next is nothing. In other words, do not
respond any further to the feelings of desire. You can certainly come back to
those feelings later if you need to. Take a time-out instead of acting on the
desire. You might want to leave the situation where you’re experiencing
temptation. Many types of urges only last a minute or so at a time, although
they may recur throughout the day. You only have to deal with the present
moment, though, one instance of an urge or craving at a time. So having
caught those feelings early and reminded yourself that it’s mainly your
thinking that’s causing your feelings, just refrain from acting on the desire or
go and engage in a different activity instead, something healthy that you find
intrinsically rewarding. You are always free to do something else.
For example, suppose you’re in the habit of drinking a glass of wine every
evening after work, but that’s gradually turned into a bottle of wine, perhaps
sometimes two bottles. That’s not going to be healthy for you in the long run.
Perhaps you’ve also decided your evenings would be better spent reading or
going to evening classes instead, because that’s the sort of person you’d rather
be. You know that being at home in the early evening is your trigger situation
for engaging in this habit. You’ve noticed that it starts when you feel bored
and agitated, and you tell yourself that you need a drink to relax. Now you’re
getting better at catching the urge to drink as soon as it begins to appear. You
notice your thoughts, and you’re aware of how they influence your feelings.
You tell yourself, “It’s not the wine that makes me feel desire but the way I’m
thinking about it.” So having paused and taken a step back from those
feelings, the next step is to not pour yourself a glass of wine and to refrain
from doing so long enough for the desire to abate. Additional temptations
won’t last long, and you can deal with the feeling again in exactly the same
way, one step at a time, if it comes back.

Instead of pouring a glass of wine, do something else: perhaps leave the
house for a change of scenery. Do something that gives you a sense of
genuine accomplishment rather than just a fleeting and empty sensation of
pleasure. If you’re determined to break this sort of habit, you can remove
temptation by getting rid of any bottles and wine glasses in your house and
making a commitment not to buy replacements. You can engage in healthy
“substitute behaviors” instead, like drinking fruit smoothies or herbal teas. Of
course, what you do will depend on the type of habit that you want to
overcome, but you get the general idea.
Ideally, as we’ve seen, your goal is to replace unfulfilling habits and
desires with activities that you find more intrinsically rewarding. When we
discussed values clarification earlier, we touched on this aspect of Stoicism,
which has to do with acting in more “virtuous” ways. Sometimes, though, not
doing something, the very act of overcoming a bad habit, might be considered
a virtue, something to be valued for its own sake. One of the techniques
Marcus employs most frequently in The Meditations is to ask himself what
virtue or resource Nature has given him to cope with a particular situation.
This is closely related to the question of what character traits we admire most
in other people. Marcus says we typically praise the virtue of self-control or
moderation in others, which stops us from being carried away by our
pleasures.23 We don’t normally admire anyone for how much junk food
they’ve eaten, but we praise their strength in overcoming bad habits such as
eating too much junk food.
The Stoics thought that if we want to improve ourselves, we should be
guided more by the qualities we admire in other people and our true values
and principles than by avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. That sort of
hedonistic life isn’t satisfying, and, as “The Choice of Hercules” implies, we
can’t flourish as human beings and achieve things we can be proud of until we
endure certain feelings of pain or discomfort or forgo certain pleasures.
This perspective arguably comes more to the fore when people have
children and they begin to think about what it means to be a good parent. If
you want to be a role model for your children, you should ask yourself what
sort of person you are and what qualities you want to exhibit. Developing
your own character by exercising moderation wisely in your daily life may
then become more of a priority than the simple pursuit of pleasure. Of course,

the Stoics would go further and argue that we should exercise wisdom, selfdiscipline, and moderation, not because it sets a good example for our
children but because doing so is an end in itself—virtue is its own reward. We
aim for wisdom and strength of character not because we’re hoping to gain
something else but simply because that’s who we want to be in life.
You’ve also learned how Stoics studied the attitudes and behaviors of role
models. For Marcus that included individuals from his own life like
Antoninus Pius and Junius Rusticus, and also wise historical figures like
Heraclitus, Socrates, and Diogenes the Cynic. The people we often admire
have a fairly take-it-or-leave-it attitude toward bodily pleasures such as food
and drink, like the attitude Marcus attributed to Socrates and observed in
Antoninus. They don’t crave these pleasures or feel addicted to them. They
place more value on their own character and integrity. On the other hand, they
are able to enjoy pleasures in a healthy way, within reasonable bounds,
remembering that they are temporary and not wholly under our control.
Again, it’s enlightening to consider the double standard between the things
you desire for yourself and the things you find admirable in others. Many
people find the suggestion that they should abandon certain pleasures almost
shocking at first. However, the same people often praise and admire others
who exercise endurance or self-control and forgo certain pleasures for the
sake of wisdom and virtue. Epictetus used Socratic questioning to highlight
this sort of contradiction, hidden from view in people’s underlying values.
Really seeing that two beliefs are incompatible can weaken one or both of
them and help you clarify your core values. The two-column technique that
involves listing the things you typically desire in your own life and comparing
them to qualities you admire in other people can highlight inconsistencies
between the two perspectives. What would happen if you started to desire
more of the traits you admire in other people? For example, suppose you
replaced your desire to eat chocolate assuming you had one, with the desire to
be a fairly self-disciplined person and make healthy choices more
consistently? For Stoics the supreme goal is always virtue rather than
pleasure. However, healthy pleasures and even a deeper sense of joy may
follow as the consequence of living in accord with virtue.
ADD HEALTHIER SOURCES OF JOY

We saw earlier that Marcus mentions three sources of rational joy. The first
and most important is the joy that Stoics experience by glimpsing their own
progress toward wisdom and virtue, and thereby fulfilling their potential in
life. In addition to replacing unhealthy habits with more intrinsically valuable
activities, you can schedule beneficial activities every day. For example, you
might set aside ten minutes each day to write stories for your children. While
that might not replace a bad habit, it does introduce a good one, if that’s
something that gives you a sense of fulfillment. It’s like setting aside time
each day to exercise the Stoic virtues and become more like the people you
admire.
What about the joy Marcus says we can obtain by contemplating the virtue
of others? That’s related to what we’ve been saying about modeling the
attitudes and behavior of others. You might want to set aside time to write
down a description of the qualities you most admire in other people, as
Marcus does in book 1 of The Meditations, or visualize them in your mind’s
eye. Contemplating the virtues of people who are close to you may have the
added benefit of helping to improve your relationship with them. Also, how
does thinking about the qualities you admire in others affect you, and how
might you learn and benefit from this experience?
Finally, remember what Marcus said about feeling gratitude instead of
desire. In a sense, to desire something is to imagine having what you don’t
have, the presence of something that’s absent. Gratitude, on the other hand,
comes from imagining the absence of things that are currently present: What
would it be like if you didn’t have this? If we don’t occasionally picture loss,
reminding ourselves what life might be like without the things and people we
love, we would take them for granted. Keep a journal of people and things
that you’re grateful for, perhaps also focusing on what you can learn from
them. As Marcus says, though, it’s important to do this in such a way that you
don’t end up becoming overly attached to external things. Stoics try to avoid
that by reminding themselves that external things, and other people, are not
entirely under our control, and one day they will be gone. The wise man is
grateful for the gifts life has given him, but he also reminds himself that they
are merely on loan—everything changes and nothing lasts forever. Epictetus
told his Stoic students to imagine they’re guests at a banquet being handed a
sharing plate, not greedily holding on to it and scoffing the lot but politely

taking an appropriate share and then handing the rest along. That’s how Stoics
think about life in general: they aim to be grateful for external things without
becoming overly attached to them.
We’ve now seen how the Stoics aspired to find happiness in healthy ways,
through gratitude for the things they have, admiration for the strengths of
others, or pride in their own ability to act with dignity, honor, and integrity.
Also, remember that for Stoics ordinary pleasure and pain aren’t good or bad
but merely indifferent. Their main concern is to avoid becoming hedonistic by
placing too much value on physical pleasures, indulging in them, and craving
them excessively. A preference, or “light” desire, for pleasurable things and
avoiding pain and discomfort is natural for Stoics, within reasonable bounds.
We can apply some of the guidance they left us about how to master our
desires today using the framework I described. Evaluate certain habits or
desires rationally in terms of their consequences. Write down the long-term
pros and cons of indulging in the habit versus overcoming it. Close your eyes
and visualize a fork in the road representing two paths, picturing as vividly as
you can first the future with unhealthy passions, then the future with wise
actions in accord with reason. You can adapt the daily routine mentioned
earlier to look like this:
1. Morning Meditation. Think of the rising sun, the stars, and your
small space within the whole cosmos. Mentally rehearse the key
events of the day, imagining how Socrates, Zeno, Marcus Aurelius,
or your own role model would cope with habits or desires. Picture
how you plan to cope with any challenges and what inner resources
or virtues you can employ.
2. During the Day. Practice Stoic mindfulness by looking for early
warning signs of the habits or desires you want to overcome. Try to
catch them early and nip them in the bud. Pause and practice
accepting any feelings of unease with Stoic indifference. Gain
cognitive distance from your thoughts and refrain from acting on
your feelings. Engage in healthy substitute behaviors instead, which
contribute to a genuine sense of fulfillment. You could also keep a
written log or tally of certain habits, as described in this chapter.

3. Evening Meditation. At the end of the day, review how well you
fared in terms of acting in accordance with your values—that is,
virtues. In relation to desires, consider what you did well, what you
did badly, and what you could do differently tomorrow. If it helps,
imagine answering these questions before a wise Stoic mentor or
even a panel of Sages, and consider what advice they might give
you. Use what you learn to help prepare for the next day’s morning
meditation.
As we’ll see in the following chapters, you can adapt this basic Stoic
routine, and some of the same techniques, to help you cope with other
challenges in life, such as pain, anxiety, and anger. You’ll therefore be
learning to use similar techniques, but in a slightly different way.

5.
GRASPING THE NETTLE

Marcus Aurelius was known for his physical frailty, due to chronic health
problems, but he was also known for his exceptional resilience. For
instance, the historian Cassius Dio wrote:
To be sure, he could not display many feats of physical prowess; yet he had developed his body
from a very weak one to one capable of the greatest endurance.1

How do we explain this seeming paradox? How did a man so weak and
sickly become known for toughness and endurance? Perhaps the answer lies
in his attitude toward pain and illness, and the Stoic techniques he used to
cope with them.
Marcus was nearly fifty, an old man by Roman standards, at the outbreak
of the First Marcomannic War. Nevertheless, he donned the military cape
and boots, rode forth from Rome, and stationed himself on the front line.
He spent much of his time at the legionary fortress of Carnuntum, on the
other side of the Alps, by the banks of the Danube in modern-day Austria.
Cassius Dio tells us that at first Marcus was too frail to endure the frigid
northern climate and address the legions assembled before him. It was a
dangerous and physically grueling environment, even for an emperor. To
make things worse, with large numbers of men living in close proximity, the
military camps were especially vulnerable to outbreaks of the plague.
Nevertheless, Marcus typically shrugged off the hardships of life on the

northern frontier by quoting the poet Euripides: “Such things accursed war
brings in its train.” They were to be expected, in other words.
Despite his health problems and the inhospitable environment, Marcus
would spend over a decade commanding the legions along the Danube. In
The Meditations, he thanks the gods that his body held out for such a long
time under such physical duress.2 He survived the two Marcomannic Wars
and the Antonine Plague, nearly making it to the age of sixty at a time when
the odds of doing so were poor. Indeed, although he suffered from recurring
health problems, he managed to live longer than most of his
contemporaries. Still, the sudden transition to military life must have been a
tremendous physical challenge for him. It’s therefore no surprise that his
writings frequently reveal evidence of his psychological struggle to cope
with physical problems.
He’d been preparing himself to face this inner battle for most of his life,
though. Over the years, Marcus had gradually learned to endure pain and
illness by utilizing the psychological strategies of ancient Stoicism. During
the war, in writing The Meditations, he reflected on these techniques as part
of his ongoing practice. These notes reflect a state of mind attained from
more than three decades of rigorous Stoic training. In other words, his
attitude toward pain and illness during the northern campaign didn’t come
naturally to him; he had to learn it.
The Meditations isn’t our only insight into Marcus’s thinking, though. In
the early nineteenth century, the Italian scholar Angelo Mai uncovered a
treasure trove of ancient letters between the Latin rhetorician Marcus
Cornelius Fronto and several other notable individuals, including his
student Marcus Aurelius. We can’t date the individual letters precisely, but
they appear to span the whole period of Marcus and Fronto’s friendship,
until the latter’s death around 167 AD at the height of the Antonine Plague.
Their correspondence is remarkable for several reasons. For the first
time, scholars could peek into Marcus’s private life and witness his true
personality. Far from the popular caricature of a Stoic as someone coldly
austere, Marcus shows remarkable warmth and affection toward Fronto and
his family. His style of writing is casual and good-humored. He tells Fronto,
for instance, of the time he was riding in the countryside, dressed as a

regular citizen, when a shepherd rudely accused his companions of being a
band of common rogues. Marcus rode laughing into the flock, playfully
scattering the sheep to break up the argument. However, the shepherd
wasn’t amused and threw his cudgel at them, yelling as the young men fled
the scene. It’s difficult to imagine that twenty years later the author of these
affable and easygoing letters would find himself gravely noting down Stoic
meditations upon seeing the severed body parts littering the frigid
battlefields of Pannonia.
There’s something else, though, about these letters that stands in marked
contrast to The Meditations: the amount of small talk, and sometimes even
griping, that goes on about various health conditions. Fronto was roughly
twenty years Marcus’s senior and was particularly fond of complaining to
him about his assorted aches and pains. In one instance, Fronto lists the
regions of his body most afflicted during the night by widespread pain
—“my shoulder, elbow, knee, and ankle”—which he says prevented him
from writing to Marcus in his own hand.3
In another letter he writes,
After your departure I was seized by a pain in the knee, mild enough, it is true, for me to be
able to walk with due caution and use a carriage. Tonight the pain has set in more violently, but
not so badly that I cannot easily bear it when lying down, if it does not get any worse.4

Sometimes Marcus gets drawn into gossiping with Fronto about his own
health problems.
As to my present state of health, you will be able to judge that easily enough from my shaky
handwriting. It is true that as regards my strength, that is beginning to come back, and nothing
remains, besides, of the pain in my chest; but the ulcer is working on my windpipe.5

This particular letter was written before Marcus was acclaimed emperor.
It shows that by the age of forty, perhaps much earlier, he was already
suffering from the kind of symptoms that would afflict him throughout his
reign. In these letters, though, there’s no evidence of the Stoic techniques
for coping that we find a decade or more later in The Meditations.
As a youth, Marcus was fit and enjoyed physical activity, as we’ve seen.
While at Rome, he was trained to fight in armor, probably by gladiators,

using blunted weapons for practice. He also enjoyed hunting and
particularly loved to spear wild boar from horseback. He went fowling as
well, hunting birds with nets and spears.
So our overall picture of Marcus in his youth is one of a strong, athletic
young man. As he aged into his forties and fifties, though, he became
physically frail, and that seems to be how subsequent generations
remembered him. Writing in the fourth century, for instance, the Emperor
Julian imagines Marcus’s skin looked diaphanous and translucent. Marcus
even referred to himself in a speech as a weak old man, unable to take food
without pain or sleep without disturbance. The Meditations also mentions
him obtaining remedies for coughing up blood and spells of giddiness.6 He
particularly suffered from chronic chest and stomach pains. He could
manage only small amounts of food, taken late at night. Scholars have
offered different diagnoses, the most common being chronic stomach
ulcers, although he probably suffered from multiple health problems.
After the initial plague outbreak at Rome, Marcus’s court physician,
Galen, prescribed him the ancient compound known as theriac, a
mysterious concoction made from dozens of exotic ingredients, everything
from bitter myrrh to fermented viper’s flesh and a small quantity of opium.
Marcus believed that regular doses of theriac helped him endure the pain in
his stomach and chest as well as his other symptoms. He stopped using it
for a time because it was making him too drowsy, but he resumed taking a
modified version with a reduced quantity of opium. He therefore seems to
have taken theriac judiciously and in a mild form.
In any case, the medicine clearly didn’t eliminate the pain and
discomfort Marcus felt. Like many people who suffer from chronic pain, he
had to develop other ways of coping. Over the years, therefore, Marcus
came to depend on the psychological techniques of Stoicism as a way of
living with health problems, especially as things became tougher for him
after joining the army on the Danube. During the misery of the Antonine
Plague and the carnage of the Marcomannic Wars, he must have witnessed
countless people dealing with their own suffering, some better than others.
Over the course of his life, he learned a great deal by studying how a
handful of exemplary individuals endured severe pain and illness. He

interpreted that wisdom through the lens of Stoicism and then distilled it
into The Meditations.
In marked contrast to the Marcus of Fronto’s letters, he states very
bluntly in The Meditations that the wise man neither strikes a tragic attitude
nor whines about what befalls him. He’s certainly not referring to his
rhetoric teachers, Fronto and Herodes Atticus. However, when he wrote
these words, he probably had their rivals in mind: his philosophy teachers,
the men who trained him in Stoicism and provided him with a living
example of mental resilience. For example, the way Apollonius of
Chalcedon endured severe pain and several long illnesses made a lifelong
impression on Marcus. Apollonius had maintained his equanimity through
it all, never allowing any setback to knock him off course, always
remaining committed to his life’s goal of acquiring wisdom and sharing it
with others.7
However, Claudius Maximus, another one of Marcus’s Stoic tutors,
seems to have left an even more powerful impression on him. Marcus
mentions Maximus’s illness and death three times in The Meditations. Like
Apollonius, Maximus was completely resolute in his commitment to the
pursuit of wisdom despite severe illness. He wasn’t a Stoic professor, like
Apollonius, but a high-ranking Roman statesman and accomplished military
commander. He was also a tough and profoundly self-reliant individual,
renowned for his commitment to Stoicism—the sort of man who stood
upright of his own accord, as Marcus liked to put it, rather than having to be
set upright by anyone else. He remained unwavering in his resolve and
cheerful in the face of any predicament.8 It seems likely that Maximus
became ill and died not long after the Senate appointed him proconsul of
Africa in 158 AD, and his loss seems to have affected Marcus quite deeply.
Indeed, Marcus appears to compare Maximus to the Emperor Antoninus.
Both men showed impeccable strength of character, self-discipline, and
endurance in the face of pain and illness. Antoninus took good care of his
health, so that throughout most of his long life he seldom required the aid of
physicians. However, he did suffer from severe headaches, and as he grew
older, he became so doubled over that wooden splints were required to keep
his torso upright. Marcus noticed that while recovering from a severe

headache, his adoptive father would simply get right back to his duties as
emperor with renewed determination. He didn’t waste time worrying about
his ailments or allow the pain to stop him for long. As Marcus was writing
The Meditations, he found himself looking back on the peaceful manner in
which Antoninus had passed away over a decade earlier, at the venerable
age of seventy-four.9 Like Maximus, Antoninus was always contented,
always cheerful. It’s said that even as he lay dying, with his last breath he
whispered the word equanimity to his guard, which was emblematic both of
his character and of his reign. We can clearly see that Marcus’s attitude
toward pain and illness was shaped by studying the characters of these men.
Perhaps he also wanted to become less like Fronto and the other Sophists,
whose love of high-flown rhetoric risked amplifying their complaints by
turning common misfortunes into personal tragedies.
Although Marcus was a Stoic, he also drew inspiration from another,
more surprising source when it came to coping with pain and illness: the
rival philosophical school of Epicurus. The Epicureans believed that the
goal of life was pleasure (hedone). They described pleasure, though, in a
notoriously paradoxical manner, as consisting mainly of a state of freedom
from pain and suffering (ataraxia). Minimizing the emotional distress
caused by pain and illness was therefore extremely important to them.
Marcus quotes from a letter purportedly written by Epicurus nearly five
hundred years earlier. We know from another source that Epicurus was
afflicted by severe kidney stones and dysentery, which eventually caused
his death:
When I was ill, my conversation was not devoted to the sufferings of my body, nor did I chatter
about such matters to those who visited me but I continued to discuss the main elements of
natural philosophy as before, and this point especially, how it is that the mind, while being
aware of the agitations in our poor flesh, is unperturbed and preserves its specific good. Nor
did I allow the doctors to assume grand airs, as though they were engaged in something
important, but my life proceeded as well and happily as ever.10

Marcus must have been struck by the contrast between this letter and the
sort of correspondence he had been having decades earlier with Fronto. Just
as most of us do, Marcus had engaged in precisely the sort of chatter and
complaints about the “sufferings of the body” that Epicurus had warned

against. Although he was in poor health, Epicurus didn’t complain or dwell
on his symptoms. In fact, he used his illness as an opportunity to converse
in a dispassionate manner about how the mind can remain contented while
the body suffers terrible pain and discomfort. He simply carried on doing
what he loved: discussing philosophy with his friends.
Marcus quotes this letter and then exhorts himself always to act as
Epicurus did: remain focused on the pursuit of wisdom even in the face of
illness, pain, or any other hardship. This advice, he says, is common not
only to Epicureanism and Stoicism but to all other schools of philosophy.
Our main concern should always remain the use we are making right now,
from moment to moment, of our own mind.11
Marcus returns to the teachings of Epicurus concerning pain and illness
several times in The Meditations. He’s particularly interested in one of
Epicurus’s famous maxims, or Principal Doctrines, which contains advice
for coping with pain. We should remind ourselves, Epicurus said, that pain
is always bearable because it is either acute or chronic but never both. The
Church Father Tertullian neatly summed up the same idea by saying that
Epicurus coined the maxim “a little pain is contemptible, and a great one is
not lasting.” You can therefore learn to cope by telling yourself that the pain
won’t last long if it’s severe or that you’re capable of enduring much worse
if the pain is chronic. People often object to this by saying that their pain is
both chronic and severe. However, earlier in The Meditations, Marcus
paraphrased the same quote from Epicurus as follows: “On pain: if it is
unbearable, it carries us off, if it persists, it can be endured.”12 The point is
that chronic pain beyond our ability to endure would have killed us, so the
fact we’re still standing proves that we’re capable of enduring much worse.
Although this can be hard for some people to accept, participants in my
online courses who have suffered for many years with chronic pain have
reported that this Epicurean maxim has been a great help to them, just as it
was for many people throughout previous centuries. We have to practice to
keep looking at things this way, though, just as we must practice to
overcome unhealthy habits and cravings.
Why exactly did the ancients find this particular strategy so helpful as a
way of coping with pain? When people are really struggling, they focus on

their inability to cope and the feeling that the problem is spiraling out of
control: “I just can’t bear this any longer!” This is a form of
catastrophizing: focusing too much on the worst-case scenario and feeling
overwhelmed. However, Epicurus meant that by focusing instead on the
limits of your pain, whether in terms of duration or severity, you can
develop a mind-set that’s more oriented toward coping and less
overwhelmed by worry or negative emotions about your condition.
Marcus also found it helpful to think of his pain as confined to a
particular part of the body rather than allowing himself to become
consumed by imagining it as more pervasive. Pain wants to dominate your
mind and become the whole story. However, people who handle pain well
usually view it objectively, as something more limited in nature, which
makes it easier for them to see themselves coping with it in various ways.
Indeed, elsewhere in The Meditations, Marcus adds a Stoic twist to
Epicurus’s saying. “Pain is neither unendurable nor everlasting, if you keep
its limits in mind and do not add to it through your own imagination.”13 The
Stoics were typically happy to assimilate aspects of Epicureanism and other
philosophical teachings, but they tweaked them to be more compatible with
their own core doctrines. Marcus meant that pain is tolerable if we
remember that our attitude toward it is what really determines how upset we
become. It’s not our pains or illnesses that upset us but our judgments about
them, as the Stoics would put it. This is one of the main therapeutic tools in
the armamentarium of Stoic pain management.
Marcus also noted that most other forms of physical discomfort can be
dealt with in essentially the same manner. He compares coping with pain to
coping with difficulty eating and drowsiness, two problems we know he
suffered from personally. He also mentions oppressive heat, bringing to
mind the Cynic notion of learning to endure intense heat and cold. When
faced with any of these discomforts, Marcus would simply warn himself,
“You are giving way to pain.”14 Then he’d apply the same coping skills,
whether he was struggling in a blizzard along the Danube or suffering
fatigue from riding for days from his base at Aquileia in northern Italy to
the legionary fortress of Carnuntum. Pain, discomfort, fatigue—they’re all
just unpleasant sensations.

He was right. The skills people use to cope with pain—even very severe
pain—are similar to ones that can be used to deal with other uncomfortable
sensations. For instance, during ordinary forms of physical exercise, such as
jogging or yoga, there are opportunities to practice essentially the same
coping strategies. We can learn to tolerate the harmless sensations of fatigue
and discomfort experienced while doing these sorts of activities. Taking
cold showers also allows us to practice the same techniques. If we learn
these strategies well enough, then we may be able to call upon them to cope
with severe pain or serious physical injury in a crisis, even if we’re caught
off guard. Everyday tolerance of minor physical discomforts can help us
build lasting psychological resilience, in other words. You could call this a
form of stress inoculation: you learn to build up resistance to a bigger
problem by voluntarily exposing yourself repeatedly to something similar,
albeit in smaller doses or a milder form.
Over time, Marcus observed many people around him afflicted by
different illnesses and facing death in various ways. He also learned specific
coping strategies and techniques from his Stoic teachers. Indeed, Marcus
described several different Stoic strategies for dealing with pain and illness
in The Meditations. The most important thing he observed in those
individuals who coped well was their ability to “withdraw” or “separate”
their mind from bodily sensations. We’ve already introduced this Stoic
technique, which I’ve called cognitive distancing. It requires learning to
withhold value judgments from unpleasant feelings, viewing them as
morally indifferent, neither good nor bad in themselves, and ultimately
harmless. This takes practice, of course, and an understanding of the
underlying concepts.
It was mainly through the Stoic teachings of Epictetus that Marcus found
a way to conceptualize this powerful technique. One of the most famous
stories about Stoic endurance happens to be about Epictetus. He was
originally a slave and came to be owned by Epaphroditus, a secretary to
Emperor Nero. According to the Church Father Origen, Epaphroditus took
hold of Epictetus in anger one day and cruelly twisted his leg. Epictetus
didn’t react but remained completely composed. He merely warned his
master that the bone was about to snap. Epaphroditus continued twisting it,

and that’s exactly what happened. Rather than complain, Epictetus
responded matter-of-factly: “There, did I not tell you that it would break?”
Epictetus alludes to his being lame in the Discourses but never mentions
the cause. Instead, he uses his disability as an example to teach his students
about coping with illness. Disease is an impediment to our body, he tells
them, but not to our freedom of will unless we make it so. Lameness, he
says, is an impediment to the leg but not to the mind.15 Epictetus was no
more perturbed by his crippled leg than he was by his inability to grow
wings and fly—he simply accepted it as one of the many things in life that
were beyond his control. He viewed his lameness as an opportunity to
exercise wisdom and strength of character. Later in life he gained his
freedom and began teaching philosophy. Perhaps his master felt remorse. In
any case, this story powerfully illustrates the famous indifference of Stoics
to physical pain. If this story is true, Marcus would certainly have heard
about it.
HOW TO TOLERATE PAIN
It may seem natural to assume that pain is intrinsically bad, but the Stoics
employ a barrage of arguments to persuade their followers that pain and
pleasure are neither good nor bad. For instance, one way of illustrating the
indifference of pain would be to point out that, like other externals, pain can
be used either wisely or foolishly, for good or for bad. An athlete might
learn to endure the pain and discomfort of extreme physical exertion. In that
case, deliberately exposing themselves through hard exercise to painful, or
at least uncomfortable, sensations might be something beneficial insofar as
it helps them to build endurance. Of course, someone who avoids
discomfort is probably going to avoid strenuous exercise. Pain and
discomfort can become advantages in life if they provide opportunities for
us to develop our strengths. It’s also true that many ordinary people, at
certain times, exhibit indifference to pain—such as when they’re injured
while saving their own life. Some people, of course, such as masochists,
even enjoy the sensation of pain. Pain is just a sensation, in other words;
what matters is how we choose to respond to it.

Epictetus tells his students how to cope with pain and illness several
times in the Discourses. Like Epicurus before him, he believed that
complaining and chattering too much about our problems just makes them
worse, and, more importantly, it harms our character. Marcus agreed that
collective whining is bad for the soul: “No joining others in their wailing,
no violent emotion.”16 Modern cognitive therapists likewise find that
distress escalates when people tell themselves “I can’t cope!” Their distress
lessens when they begin looking at things more rationally and objectively
and acknowledge various ways they can potentially cope now or have
coped in a similar situation in the past. In part, this is an observation about
the rhetoric of pain. We should be wary of telling ourselves “This is
unbearable!” and so on, because that’s usually just hyperbole that adds to
our sense of despair.
Epictetus tells his students that it’s one thing to have a pain in the head
or in the ear, but they should not go a step further and say, “I have a pain in
the head—alas!” They shouldn’t imply that the pain is some kind of
catastrophe. He explained that he wasn’t denying them the right to groan,
just that they shouldn’t do so inwardly by actually buying into the notion
that they’ve been harmed. Just because a slave is slow in bringing them a
bandage they shouldn’t cry aloud and torment themselves, complaining
“Everyone hates me!” (“For who would not hate such a man?” he adds
sardonically.) He summed up his practical advice by telling his students to
respond to troubling events or unpleasant sensations by literally saying This
is nothing to me. This perhaps overstates things. Stoics can still “prefer” to
avoid pain and illness when possible. Once it’s already happening, though,
they try to accept the fact with indifference.
In addition to the maxim of Epicurus, Marcus mentions many Stoic
strategies for bearing pain and illness by viewing them with studied
indifference. Most of these strategies were influenced by the Discourses of
Epictetus.
1. Separate your mind from the sensation, which I call “cognitive
distancing,” by reminding yourself that it is not things, or
sensations, that upset us but our judgments about them.

2. Remember that the fear of pain does more harm than pain itself,
or use other forms of functional analysis to weigh up the
consequences for you of fearing versus accepting pain.
3. View bodily sensations objectively (objective representation, or
phantasia kataleptike) instead of describing them in emotive
terms. (“There’s a feeling of pressure around my forehead” versus
“It feels like I’m dying—an elephant might as well be stamping
over and over on my head!”)
4. Analyze the sensations into their elements and limit them as
precisely as possible to their specific site on the body, thereby
using the same depreciation by analysis that we used in the
previous chapter to neutralize unhealthy desires and cravings.
(“There’s a sharp throbbing sensation in my ear that comes and
goes,” not “I’m in total agony.”)
5. View the sensation as limited in time, changeable, and transient,
or “contemplate impermanence.” (“This sensation only peaks for
a few seconds at a time and then fades away; it will probably be
gone in a couple of days.”) If you have an acute problem like
toothache, you’ll have forgotten what it felt like years from now.
If you have a long-term problem such as chronic sciatica, you’ll
know it sometimes gets worse and so at other times it must be less
severe. It makes a difference if you can focus on the notion that
this shall pass.
6. Let go of your struggle against the sensation and accept it as
natural and indifferent, what is called “Stoic acceptance.” That
doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take practical steps to deal with it,
such as using medication to reduce pain, but you must learn to
live with the pain without resentment or an emotional struggle.
7. Remind yourself that Nature has given you both the capacity to
exercise courage and the endurance to rise above pain and that we
admire these virtues in other people, which we discussed in
relation to contemplating and modeling virtue.
We’ll look at each of these strategies in turn.

COGNITIVE DISTANCING

The most important pain-management strategy mentioned by Epictetus and
Marcus is the one we’ve called “cognitive distancing.” It’s summed up in a
phrase that will already be familiar to you: “It’s not events that upset us but
our judgments about events.”17 If we apply that to the concept of pain, it
means that the pain isn’t what upsets us but rather our judgments about it.
When we suspend the activity of assigning value judgments to the pain, our
suffering is alleviated. It’s always within our power to do this in any
situation—it’s up to us how much importance we choose to invest in bodily
sensations.
Marcus describes the suspension of value judgments as the
“withdrawal,” “separation,” or “purification” (katharsis) of the mind from,
in this case, bodily sensations of pain and illness. He also likes to explain
the suspension of judgment by saying that pain and pleasure should be left
where they stand, in the parts of the body to which they belong. Even if the
body, the closest companion of the mind, is “cut or burned, or festers or
decays,” we can preserve our ruling faculty in a peaceful state as long as we
don’t judge bodily sensations as being intrinsically good or bad.18
Marcus also calls this being “indifferent to indifferent things.”19 There’s
a particularly important passage where he spells out the subtleties of Stoic
psychology in this regard.20 We should keep our ruling faculty undisturbed
by external things, including bodily sensations of pain and pleasure. He
says this means not allowing it to unite with them but rather drawing a line
around the mind, marking its boundaries, with bodily sensations on the
other side, as if viewed from a distance—over there. On the other hand,
when we allow ourselves to make strong value judgments about external
sensations such as pain, we merge our minds with them and lose ourselves
in the experience of suffering.
It’s important to note that Marcus isn’t asking us to deny that pain (or
pleasure, for that matter) is part of life, even for the Stoic wise man. He
notes that sensations of pain and pleasure will inevitably find their way into
our consciousness because of the natural sympathy that exists between the
mind and the body. He stresses that you should not try to suppress the
sensations, because they are natural, and you should not assign judgments

to them as good or bad, helpful or harmful. This delicate balance is central
to modern mindfulness and acceptance-based cognitive therapy, which
teaches clients neither to suppress unpleasant feelings nor to worry about
them. Instead, you should learn to accept them while remaining detached
from them.
For Marcus, what matters is that we stop looking at pain and illness
through the lens of harm. Those judgments originate within us. They are
projected outward onto bodily sensations and other external events. It’s
important to remember that whether we view something as helpful or
harmful depends entirely upon our goals. Most people take for granted
assumptions they have about their goals in life, so much so that they are
rarely aware of them. If my goal is to look handsome, then if I break my
nose, I’m bound to view it as harmful rather than helpful. But if my most
cherished goal is survival and I break my nose while narrowly escaping
certain death, I’d probably view it with relative indifference. The Stoics
want us to go through a radical upheaval in our underlying values so that
our supreme goal is to live with wisdom and its accompanying virtues.
They want us to treat physical pain and injuries with indifference. In fact,
these misfortunes can even provide an opportunity for us to exercise greater
wisdom and strength of character. Marcus tells himself:
Do away with the judgment, and the notion “I have been harmed” is done away with; do away
with that notion, and the harm itself is gone.21

So do the Stoics not care at all about physical health? Yes, they do. They
classify it as a preferred indifferent. It’s natural and reasonable for us to
prefer health to sickness. Physical health provides us with more opportunity
to exercise our will and influence external events in life. In itself, health is
not really good or bad. It’s more like an opportunity. A foolish person may
squander the advantages good health provides by indulging in his vices. A
wise and good person, by contrast, may use both health and illness as
opportunities to exercise virtue. Was Epictetus “harmed” when his leg was
broken if we suppose that this was one of the events that set him on the path
to becoming a great philosopher? He would say that what matters,

ultimately, is the harm we do to our own character. By comparison, a
mangled leg is trivial.
If we can learn to withhold our judgment that pain is terrible or harmful,
then we can strip away its horrific mask, and it no longer appears so
monstrous to us.22 We’re just left with the banal observation that our flesh is
being stimulated “roughly,” as Epictetus liked to put it. It’s just a sensation.
Through our judgment that it is intrinsically bad, unbearable, or
catastrophic, though, we escalate the mere sensation of bodily pain into the
inner turmoil of emotional suffering. For instance, Marcus elsewhere
addresses (apostrophizes) his impressions and bodily sensations, saying,
Go away, I entreat you by the gods, as you did come, for I do not want you. But you have come
according to the ancient fashion. I am not angry with you: only go away.23

“I am not angry with you,” he says to the painful feeling, because he
does not perceive it as bad or harmful. It enters the mind in the age-old
manner, through sensation, a natural physiological process that humans
share with animals. Ironically, you don’t need to try to suppress or resist
unpleasant feelings as long as you abandon the belief that they are bad. If
you accept them with indifference, then they do you no harm. When your
conscious mind, your ruling faculty, invests too much importance in bodily
sensations, it becomes “fused and blended” with them, and it is pulled
around by the body like a puppet on strings.24 However, you always have
the potential within you to rise above physical sensations and view them
with studied indifference.
FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS

Once you’ve gained cognitive distance, you’re in a better position to
consider the consequences of your value judgments (“functional analysis”).
Given that suffering arises from our negative value judgments, the Stoics
say that the fear of pain does us far more harm than pain itself because it
injures our very character. Pain, by contrast, is harmless if you learn to
accept it with an attitude of indifference. Epictetus stated this very
succinctly: “For death or pain is not fearsome, but rather the fear of pain or
death.”25 To live life fully, you have to get out of your comfort zone, as we

say today. Fear of pain makes cowards out of us all and limits our sphere of
life.
It’s important to have a firm grasp of a behavior’s negative consequences
if we want to change it. For example, blood phobia might prevent someone
from having medical tests they require—for some women it’s even an
obstacle to giving birth. Indeed, most people are frightened of pain and
illness to varying degrees. Realizing that fear of pain may be doing you
more harm than the pain itself can motivate you to start regularly practicing
the psychological skills required to overcome intolerance of pain and
discomfort.
OBJECTIVE REPRESENTATION

Marcus also learned to describe external events and bodily sensations to
himself as natural processes, adopting the language of objective
representation. As noted earlier, we can compare this to the neutral and
detached way a physician might document the symptoms of illness in a
patient. Epictetus and Marcus both do this when they describe painful and
unpleasant sensations merely as “rough” movements, or agitations,
occurring in the flesh.
Thoughts such as these reach through to the things themselves and strike to the heart of them,
allowing us to see them as they truly are.26

It’s as if we were describing the problems of another person: with
greater objectivity and detachment. I might say to myself, for example,
“The dentist is working on Donald’s teeth,” thereby thinking of it
dispassionately from a third-person perspective.
DEPRECIATION BY ANALYSIS

Marcus also tells himself to avoid overwhelming his mind by worrying
about the future or ruminating about the past. When we focus our attention
on the reality of the here and now it becomes easier to conquer. By viewing
things objectively, isolating the present moment and dividing it into smaller
parts, we can tackle them one at a time, using the method we’ve called
depreciation by analysis. He says, for example, that we should ask of each

present difficulty, “What is there in this that is unbearable or beyond
endurance?”27 Indeed, Marcus notes that the power of events to afflict us is
greatly diminished if we set aside thoughts of the past and future and focus
only on the present moment, the here and now, in isolation.
This divide-and-conquer strategy is still used in modern cognitivebehavioral therapy to combat unpleasant feelings; clients might be
encouraged to focus on the present moment and deal with overwhelming
experiences one step at a time. The Stoics move between this perspective
and one that modern scholars call the “view from above,” which involves
picturing your current situation from high above, as part of the whole of life
on Earth, or even the whole of time and space. One strategy divides events
up into smaller parts, and the other imagines the whole of existence and an
event’s minuscule place within it. Both strategies can help us view external
events, such as pain and illness, with greater indifference.28
CONTEMPLATING FINITUDE AND IMPERMANENCE

Having described any painful sensations or symptoms of illness to
ourselves in objective language and analyzed them into their component
parts, we can usually also view them as being confined to a particular
location in the body. Marcus consistently reminds himself to view pain and
pleasure as belonging to the parts of the body where they’re located—in
other words, to think of the smallness of the sensation in contrast with the
expansiveness of his observing consciousness. He thereby taught himself to
think of pain remaining “over there” at a distance.
Let the affected part of the body complain if it must, he says. The mind
doesn’t need to agree and go along with it by judging the sensation to be
very bad and harmful.29 Think of the pain in your body as if it’s the barking
of an angry dog; don’t start barking along with the dog by groaning about
your own pain. It’s always within your power to consider the sensation as
belonging to the body and limited to a specific location. You can choose to
leave it there rather than becoming fused with it through worry and
rumination.
The mind, too, can preserve its calm by withdrawing itself, and the ruling faculty comes to no
harm; as for the parts that are harmed by pain, let them declare it, if they are able to.30

Therapists today help their clients objectify pain in this way by
attributing an arbitrary shape or color to it, such as a black circle. This
technique, called “physicalizing” the feeling, can help you picture it in your
mind’s eye, from a detached perspective, at a particular location in the body.
You might even think of yourself as looking at physical pain or another
symptom of illness through a glass window, separating the body from the
mind, or imagining the pain as temporarily outside of the body on the other
side of the room.
In addition to viewing unpleasant sensations as limited spatially to the
affected part of the body, Marcus frequently reminds himself to consider
their duration and to view them as limited in both time and space. He
employs this strategy with externals in general but particularly with painful
sensations and symptoms of illness. It resembles advice given by Epicurus,
to focus on the fact that acute pain is temporary. You might be familiar with
the Persian saying “This too shall pass,” quoted by Abraham Lincoln,
which makes a similar point. We can also remind ourselves how many
unpleasant sensations have already come and gone in the past as a way of
highlighting their transience.
This approach is one of Marcus’s favorite strategies for encouraging an
attitude of Stoic indifference. Viewing things as changeable, like a flowing
river, can help weaken our emotional attachment to them. Sometimes he
goes further and reminds himself of his own transience—his mortality. We
will achieve indifference to painful feelings, he says, if we remember that
the demands they place on our attention will only be for a limited time,
because life is short and will soon be at an end.31
STOIC ACCEPTANCE

Epictetus also said that we should actively accept sickness and painful
feelings if they befall us (“Stoic acceptance”). He said that our feet, if they
had minds of their own, would willingly be driven into the mud with each
footstep we take, accepting it as a necessary part of their natural function.32
This recalls the early Stoic metaphor of the dog following the cart. A dog
tethered to a moving cart can either pull on his leash and be roughly
dragged along or accept his fate and run along smoothly beside the cart.

Indeed, one of the earliest Stoic definitions of man’s natural goal is that it
consists in a “smoothly flowing” life, free from unnecessary struggle. The
concept of radically accepting unpleasant feelings has likewise become
central to modern cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Pain becomes more
painful when we struggle against it, but the burden is often lightened,
paradoxically, if we can accept the sensation and relax into it or even
welcome it. Struggling to suppress, control, or eliminate unpleasant feelings
adds another layer to our misery and frequently backfires by making the
original problem worse.
Marcus actually imagines Nature herself as a physician, like Asclepius,
the god of medicine, prescribing hardships to him as if they were painful
remedies.33 To take Nature’s medicine properly, we must accept our fate and
respond virtuously, with courage and self-discipline, thereby improving our
character. So Marcus sees voluntarily accepting hardship as a
psychotherapy of the passions. We must swallow the bitter pills of Fate and
accept painful feelings and other unpleasant symptoms of illness when they
befall us.
The Stoics were influenced in this regard by the older Cynic practice of
voluntary hardship, as we’ve seen. They would deliberately expose
themselves to discomfort, such as intense heat or cold, in order to develop
psychological endurance. The paradox of accepting discomfort is that it
often leads to less suffering. Diogenes the Cynic reputedly taught that we
should treat painful sensations like wild dogs. They will bite and tear at our
heels the more we try to flee in panic but will often back down if we have
the courage to turn and face them calmly.
It is like the bite that one can get when one takes hold of a wild beast, says Bion [of
Borysthenes]; if you grasp a snake by its middle, you will get bitten, but if you seize it by the
head, nothing bad will happen to you. And likewise, he says, the pain that you may suffer as a
result of things outside yourself depends on how you apprehend them, and if you apprehend
them in the same way as Socrates, you will feel no pain, but if you take them in any other way,
you will suffer, not on account of any of the things themselves, but of your own character and
false opinions.34

However, most ordinary people unwittingly invite the assaults of Fortune
by turning their backs in flight rather than confronting her face to face.

Dio Chrysostom, a Sophist who studied under the great Stoic teacher
Musonius Rufus, compared the Cynic to a boxer who fares better if he
prepares himself to be struck and to accept it with indifference. If, on the
other hand, he shrinks anxiously away from his opponent, he will expose
himself to a worse beating. Chrysostom also compared enduring pain to
trampling out a fire—if we do it gingerly, we’re more likely to be burned
than if we stamp on it confidently. Children even make a game of
quenching flames on their tongues, he says, by doing it quickly and
confidently. Today, we speak of “grasping the nettle” to make the point that
facing something and accepting it often leads to less injury than
approaching it hesitantly and defensively. (If you brush against a nettle,
you’ll get stung; if you hold the nettle tight in the right way, pressing the
sharp spines flat, you’ll prevent it from stinging you.) By calmly grasping
the nettle of pain rather than struggling against it, resenting it, or
complaining about it, we can learn to suffer less from it.
The Cynics and Stoics were thousands of years ahead of their time in
proposing voluntary acceptance as a way of coping with pain and other
unpleasant feelings. This acceptance has long been part of modern behavior
therapy protocols for pain management, and in recent decades it’s become
the central focus of many therapists dealing with these issues. Distraction
can sometimes work for very brief (acute) pain, such as surgical procedures
or dentistry, but avoidance strategies tend to backfire when used for coping
with chronic pain. Like the Stoic dog following the cart, we have no real
choice but to face our pain. Nevertheless, you can choose whether to do so
roughly, struggling and fighting against it, or smoothly, through calm
acceptance. Most people find that accepting pain greatly diminishes the
emotional suffering it causes. Struggling with pain, trying to suppress or
avoid it, consumes your time and energy, limits your behavior, and stops
you from getting on with other things—so acceptance can also improve
your quality of life in this respect. Moreover, in some cases, accepting our
bodily sensations can allow natural habituation to take place, so that we
begin to notice our pain less, and painful sensations may even begin to
diminish as a result.

It’s therefore important to avoid struggling too much against painful or
uncomfortable bodily sensations because there’s considerable evidence
from modern psychology that doing so can be counterproductive.
Researchers call this urge to control or avoid unpleasant feelings
“experiential avoidance,” and it has proven quite toxic to mental health.
People who strongly believe that unpleasant feelings are bad and try to
suppress them from their minds often become more tense and preoccupied
with the very feelings they’re trying to avoid, trapping themselves in a
vicious cycle. For the Stoics, pain is “indifferent” and not bad. It’s therefore
accepted as a natural process. In one graphic passage, Marcus tells himself
that complaining about events is as futile and unhelpful as the kicks and
squeals that piglets make as they struggle to free themselves during a ritual
sacrifice.35 Struggling against things we can’t control does us more harm
than good.
CONTEMPLATING VIRTUE

Epictetus actually delivered a discourse titled “In What Manner We Ought
to Bear Sickness.” In it he argues that pain and sickness are an inevitable
part of life, and just as in any other part of life, there are relevant virtues,
which are always within our power to exercise.
If you bear a fever well, you have all that belongs to a man in a fever. What is it to bear a fever
well? Not to blame God or man; not to be afflicted at that which happens, to expect death well
and nobly, to do what must be done: when the physician comes in, not to be frightened at what
he says; nor if he says, “you are doing well,” to be overjoyed.36

Epictetus liked to tell his students that in the face of everything that
befalls them, they should get into the habit of asking themselves what
capacity, or virtue, they possess for making good use of the event. Similarly,
cognitive therapists ask their clients, “What resources do you have that
might help you to cope better with pain?” For example, if we’re faced with
severe pain, then we will find that Nature has equipped us with the potential
for endurance, and if we get into the habit of exercising that virtue, then the
painful sensations will no longer have mastery over us.37

Another useful way to approach pain is to ask ourselves how someone
experiencing the same kind of pain or illness we’re facing might cope with
it more admirably (modeling virtue). What would we praise other people
for doing in the same situation? Consider then to what extent we can do the
same by emulating those strengths or virtues.
Like Epictetus, Marcus often stresses that many ordinary people show
great courage and self-discipline in the service of worldly goals, such as
greed or showing off to impress others.
Nothing happens to anyone that he is not fitted by Nature to bear. The same things happen to
another, and either because he fails to realize that they have happened to him, or because he
wants to display his strength of mind, he stands firm and remains unaffected. Is it not
extraordinary that ignorance and self-conceit should prove more powerful than wisdom?38

Marcus reminds himself, though, that we can render everything that
befalls us in life bearable by suggesting to ourselves either that it is in our
interest to do so or that our duty somehow demands it. When we have a
reason to endure something, it becomes easier. As Nietzsche said, “He who
has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”39 It’s often easier to endure
pain if we are confident that it’s doing us no harm or if we’re fixated on
some goal. Boxers take punches without complaining to win matches. Their
ability to do this puts philosophers to shame, even though the latter believe
themselves to be motivated by something infinitely more important: the
love of wisdom. Nevertheless, we can learn from observing others that
anyone can endure great pain and hardship if they are sufficiently motivated
to do so.
STOICISM IN EARLY PSYCHOTHERAPY
You’ve learned how the Stoic techniques for coping with pain and illness
described by Marcus resemble some of those employed in modern CBT.
However, at the start of the twentieth century, long before CBT, there was
another “rational” or “cognitive” approach to psychotherapy that competed
with Freudian psychoanalysis but is now largely forgotten. The Swiss
psychiatrist and neuropathologist Paul Dubois, author of The

Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment (1904), was the main
proponent of what became known as “rational psychotherapy.” Dubois
believed that psychological problems were due mainly to negative thinking,
which worked like negative autosuggestion, and he favored a treatment
based on the practice of “Socratic dialogue” through which he sought to
rationally persuade patients to abandon the unhealthy ideas responsible for
various neurotic and psychosomatic conditions. The influence of the ancient
Stoics is clear from Dubois’s scattered references to them.
If we eliminate from ancient writings a few allusions that gave them local colour, we shall find
the ideas of Socrates, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius absolutely modern and
applicable to our times.40

Dubois was particularly interested in the way Stoicism could be used to
help psychotherapy patients cope with chronic pain and other physical or
psychosomatic symptoms.
The idea is not new; the stoics have pushed to the last degree this resistance to pain and
misfortune. The following lines, written by Seneca, seem to be drawn from a modern treatise
on psychotherapy: “Beware of aggravating your troubles yourself and of making your position
worse by your complaints. Grief is light when opinion does not exaggerate it; and if one
encourages one’s self by saying, ‘This is nothing,’ or, at least, ‘This is slight; let us try to
endure it, for it will end,’ one makes one’s grief slight by reason of believing it such.” And,
further: “One is only unfortunate in proportion as one believes one’s self so.” One could truly
say concerning nervous pains that one only suffers when he thinks he does.41

Dubois quoted Seneca’s letters to illustrate the role of patience and
acceptance, as opposed to worry, in helping us to cope with and avoid
exacerbating physical illness. He also quoted Seneca’s remarks that the
principles of Stoic philosophy consoled him during illness and acted upon
him “like medicine,” strengthening the body by elevating the soul.
However, one of the most striking and memorable passages in Dubois
concerns something that one of his patients said to him about the Stoics:
A young man into whom I tried to instil a few principles of stoicism towards ailments stopped
me at the first words, saying, “I understand, doctor; let me show you.” And taking a pencil he
drew a large black spot on a piece of paper.
“This,” said he, “is the disease, in its most general sense, the physical trouble—rheumatism,
toothache, what you will—moral trouble, sadness, discouragement, melancholy. If I

acknowledge it by fixing my attention upon it, I already trace a circle to the periphery of the
black spot, and it has become larger. If I affirm it with acerbity the spot is increased by a new
circle. There I am, busied with my pain, hunting for means to get rid of it, and the spot only
becomes larger. If I preoccupy myself with it, if I fear the consequences, if I see the future
gloomily, I have doubled or trebled the original spot.” And, showing me the central point of the
circle, the trouble reduced to its simplest expression, he said with a smile, “Should I not have
done better to leave it as it was?”
“One exaggerates, imagines, anticipates affliction,” wrote Seneca. For a long time, I have
told my discouraged patients and have repeated to myself, “Do not let us build a second story
to our sorrow by being sorry for our sorrow.”42

This diagram, added Dubois, illustrates that “he who knows how to
suffer suffers less.” The burden of physical pain or illness is light when we
look at it objectively, without “drawing concentric circles” around it, which
multiply our suffering by adding layers of fear and worry.
By the time he wrote The Meditations, Marcus had a different
relationship with pain than he had when he exchanged complaints with
Fronto. According to the Stoics, our initial reaction to pain or illness may be
natural and reasonable, but amplifying or perpetuating our suffering by
complaining about it over time is unnatural and unreasonable. Animals may
cry out in pain and lick their wounds for a while, but they don’t ruminate
about it for weeks afterward or write letters to their friends complaining
about how badly they’ve been sleeping. Marcus had learned how to suffer
properly and thereby to suffer less, as Dubois would have put it. This is how
he must have coped with both chronic pain and illness throughout the
course of the First Marcomannic War, in which he led Rome to victory.

6.
THE INNER CITADEL AND WAR OF MANY
NATIONS

It was an ambush! Wave after wave of Sarmatian horsemen crashed out of
the forest on the far side of the River Danube to engage the Roman
legionaries head on. Some split off in a classic pincer maneuver,
outflanking and encircling the men standing helplessly in the killing zone,
midway across the frozen river. Marcus looked on quietly with his generals.
The barbarians regularly sneaked across the river that marked the front line
to raid settlements in the province of Pannonia. The Romans had learned
that the enemy horsemen were most vulnerable when encumbered with loot
on their return journey, so they would pursue them across the river, hoping
to catch them as they slowed their pace to make the crossing back into their
own lands. Sometimes, however, the raiders were just leading the Romans
into a trap.
As soon as the Romans recognized the enemy ambush was being sprung,
the infantry assumed their standard defensive formation, known as a
“hollow square.” Officers and lightly armored troops were protected on the
inside by legionaries facing outward on all four sides, their rectangular
shields packed tightly together forming a protective wall. The Sarmatians
knew that tactic very well. It worked as long as the Romans could hold
formation, but they would be massacred if a cavalry charge managed to
break through the square and throw them into disarray. That’s why the
Sarmatians had lured them onto the river: their horses were trained to

charge across the ice. When their lances smashed into the shields of the
legionaries forming those defensive walls, the Romans would slip, lose
their footing, and tumble like bowling pins.
The Sarmatians were a mysterious, intimidating enemy. They were
actually a loose coalition of nomadic tribes led by King Bandaspus, ruler of
the Iazyges, the most warlike among the tribes. Sarmatian men were tall
and muscular, with fierce blue eyes and long reddish-yellow hair and
beards. These exceptional horsemen rode into battle clad in a type of scale
mail carved from hooves. Their unusual armor reminded the Romans of a
python’s skin, perhaps even conjuring images of dragons. It was said that
the Iazyges worshiped fire. They wore great helms and fought with huge
wooden lances tipped with sharpened bone. However, what shocked the
Romans most of all was the discovery, as they removed helmets from the
corpses of slain Sarmatians, that many of the warriors were women.
The sight of hundreds, perhaps thousands of Sarmatian horsemen
charging across the frozen Danube must have been terrifying. Marcus had
learned to gaze calmly on these fearsome warriors and the carnage of the
battlefield by recalling the Stoic precepts he’d studied as a young man. He
took a slow, deep breath as he watched the first wave of lancers collide
against Roman shields. Almost immediately, his general and son-in-law,
Claudius Pompeianus, turned toward him and smiled. Their plan was
working: this time the Sarmatians were in for a surprise. The legionaries
held formation perfectly as the lances struck their shields and glanced off
harmlessly. Marcus’s infantry had learned a new trick. Men on the interior
of the square had laid their shields on the ice, holding them fast in place.
The legionaries forming the outer wall then braced their rear foot against
their comrades’ shields. So far, that was proving good enough to stabilize
them against the impact of enemy lances.
As the Sarmatian horsemen reeled from the shock of their failed charge,
the Roman counterattack began with deadly efficiency. Skirmishers darted
out between the legionaries’ shields. The Romans quickly grabbed hold of
the horses’ bridles and used their own body weight to make the horses slip
and fall sideways onto the ice, dismounting their riders. The Roman
legionaries thrust spears at the Sarmatians from behind their wall of shields.

The ice was soon awash with blood as bodies piled up. The remaining
barbarians found themselves struggling to keep their footing. Unable to flee
back to the safety of the forest, they were thrown into disarray right where
the Romans wanted them. Before long everyone was slipping, caught up in
a melee, Romans grappling with Sarmatians on the bloody ice. However,
Marcus’s legionaries were trained in wrestling. If a Sarmatian knocked a
Roman down, the Roman would pull his assailant on top of him while lying
prone on the ice, then kick him off with both legs, throwing him onto his
back and reversing their positions. The tribesmen had little experience of
this kind of disciplined close-combat fighting and, caught off guard by the
change of tactics, were eventually routed.
Marcus had successfully turned the ambush around and inflicted a major
defeat on King Bandaspus. After several initial setbacks, the tide of war
now began to turn in Rome’s favor. The Sarmatians could no longer depend
on using the terrain to their advantage. Voluntarily walking into an ambush
had obviously been a dangerous strategy for the Romans. It required
immense discipline and careful preparation—the troops had trained in
secret during the winter months. And it worked. They had kept their nerve
in a chaotic situation, facing their most fearsome enemy, and snatched
victory from the very jaws of defeat.
HOW TO RELINQUISH FEAR
Epictetus taught his students to think of Stoic philosophy as being like the
caduceus, the magic wand of Hermes: every misfortune is transformed into
something good by its touch.1 Marcus had learned to become adept at this
sort of thinking. Stoics calmly envisaged different types of misfortune on a
daily basis as part of their contemplative training, learning to view them
with relative indifference. Indeed, envisaging feared catastrophes as if they
were really happening can be viewed as a kind of emotional battle drill, a
way of preparing for worst-case scenarios. Stoics would mentally rehearse
ways of responding to these events with wisdom and virtue, turning
obstacles into opportunities where possible. One consequence of embracing
our fears is that we’re more likely to creatively turn apparent setbacks to

our advantage, as the Romans did in their battle on the Danube. These
Sarmatian ambushes must have seemed like military catastrophes to the
Romans at first. What if they concealed the opportunity to spring a deadly
trap, though, that could turn the tide of the war? The obstacle standing in
the way becomes the way.
These opportunities came more readily to Stoic leaders because they
were trained to be unafraid of seeming misfortunes. After all, Fortune
favors the brave, as the Roman poets said. However, for the Stoics, the
supreme goal was to remain composed and exercise wisdom even in the
face of great danger, whatever the outcome. Marcus tells himself to always
remember when he starts to feel frustrated with events that “this is not a
misfortune, but rather to bear it nobly is good fortune.” After Lucius’s
sudden death in 169 AD, Marcus had been unexpectedly left in sole
command of the troops assembling along the Danube for the First
Marcomannic War. In his late fifties, with no military experience
whatsoever, he’d found himself in command of the largest army ever
massed on a Roman frontier. He stood at the head of roughly 140,000 men
who awaited his orders, unsure what to expect of him. It must have been
incredibly daunting. Yet he embraced his new role completely and turned it
into an opportunity to deepen his Stoic resolve.
There should be no question that he risked his own life in stationing
himself at the front. At the outbreak of the war, Pannonia had been
completely overrun by a huge coalition army led by Ballomar, the young
king of the Marcomanni. Ballomar had secretly brought together many
smaller tribes, but he was also supported by a huge army of the
Marcomanni’s powerful neighbors, the Quadi. The Romans had suffered a
catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Carnuntum, reputedly losing twenty
thousand men in a single day, including the praetorian prefect in command,
Furius Victorinus. Nevertheless, Marcus remained very close to the action.
In The Meditations, he vividly describes the sight of severed hands, feet,
and heads lying at unsettling distances from their bodies.2 Indeed, he makes
a point of noting down that he’s writing at Carnuntum, the main legionary
fortress on the front line, and “on the Granua, among the Quadi,” which

puts him farther east, presumably later, across the Danube inside enemy
territory.
Perhaps surprisingly, given the danger that he faced, Marcus never really
mentions anxiety about the terrors of war in The Meditations. It does seem
as though he was a natural worrier at first, anxiously burning the midnight
oil as he worked obsessively on matters of state. By the time he was writing
these notes to himself on philosophy, though, he seems to have become a
much calmer and more self-assured man. Perhaps he redoubled his efforts
to assimilate Stoicism following the death of his tutor Junius Rusticus, and
that accounts for the transformation. When he arrived in Carnuntum to take
command of the legions, he was both physically frail and an absolute
novice—an “old woman” of a philosopher, sneered the future usurper,
Avidius Cassius. Everyone must have questioned Marcus’s competence to
lead such a massive campaign. However, both his practice of Stoicism and
the long and grueling wars against the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians
were slowly molding his character. Seven years later we find him a
hardened veteran, and the northern legions, having learned to revere their
new commander, are now fiercely loyal to Marcus Aurelius.
The soldiers firmly believed that the gods were on their emperor’s side,
and they even attributed two legendary battlefield miracles to Marcus
Aurelius’s presence. The first, called the “Thunder Miracle,” occurred in
174 AD, when the troops claimed that Marcus’s prayers had called down a
lightning bolt that destroyed a siege engine being used by the Sarmatians. A
month later, in July 174 AD, it was claimed that Marcus brought about a
“Rain Miracle.” A detachment of men from the Thundering Legion, led by
Pertinax, found themselves surrounded, vastly outnumbered, and out of
water. According to one account, Marcus raised his hand and prayed: “With
this hand which has never taken life, I turn to Thee and worship the Giver
of life.” (That would surely be the Stoic Zeus, although Christians later
implausibly claimed that Marcus was praying to their God.) At that
moment, a torrential rainstorm ensued, and as they fought on, it’s said the
Romans gulped down water from their helmets, mixed with the blood
running from their wounds. Marcus wasn’t superstitious, as we’ve seen.
The legions, however, clearly believed that he was blessed by the gods and

acclaimed him their victorious commander. We’re told that when he
eventually passed away, the soldiers wept loudly.
THE STOIC RESERVE CLAUSE

So how did Marcus overcome his total lack of experience and become such
an accomplished military leader? How did he remain composed in the face
of uncertain odds against such formidable enemies? One of the most
important Stoic techniques that he employed was called acting “with a
reserve clause” (hupexhairesis), a technical term that he mentions at least
five times in The Meditations. Although the idea goes back to the early
Stoics, Marcus actually learned how to perform every action cautiously and
with a “reserve clause” from reading Epictetus’s Discourses.3 In essence, it
means undertaking any action while calmly accepting that the outcome isn’t
entirely under your control. We learn from Seneca and others that it could
take the form of a caveat, such as “Fate permitting,” “God willing,” or “If
nothing prevents me.” It implies that one is taking action while excluding
something: assumptions regarding the eventual outcome, particularly any
expectations of success. We say “reserve clause,” incidentally, because our
expectations are reserved for what is within our sphere of control. We’re
pursuing an external result “with the reservation” that the outcome is not
entirely up to us. “Do what you must, let happen what may,” as the saying
goes.
In Cicero’s dialogue De Finibus, the Roman Stoic hero Cato of Utica
uses the memorable image of an archer or spearman to explain this subtle
concept. The Stoic-minded archer’s true goal should be to fire his bow
skillfully, insofar as doing so is within his power. Paradoxically, though,
he’s indifferent to whether or not his arrow actually hits the target. He
controls his aim but not the arrow’s flight. So he does the best he can and
accepts whatever happens next. The target—perhaps an animal he’s hunting
—could move unexpectedly. Marcus perhaps had this analogy in mind
when he was spearing birds and hunting wild boar as a young man. Virtue
consists in doing your very best and yet not becoming upset if you come
home from the hunt empty-handed—we typically admire people who
approach life in this way.

Marcus makes it clear that his internal goal is to live with virtue,
particularly wisdom and justice, but his external aim, his preferred
outcome, is the common welfare of mankind (not just of his Roman
subjects, incidentally). Although the outcome is ultimately indifferent to
Stoics, it’s precisely the action of pursuing the common good that
constitutes the virtue of justice. Indeed, whether you succeed or fail in your
attempts to benefit others, you may still be perfectly virtuous as long as
your efforts are sincere. It’s your intentions that count, both morally and
psychologically. Nevertheless, you must aim them at an appropriate
outcome. For instance, acting in accord with justice means preferring to
achieve, Fate willing, an external outcome that is both fair and beneficial
for humankind. Marcus refers to this countless times throughout The
Meditations.
Indeed, whereas other philosophical schools sometimes advised their
students to preserve their equanimity by avoiding the stress and
responsibilities of public life, Chrysippus told the Stoics that “the wise man
will take part in politics, if nothing prevents him.” The wise man, in other
words, desires to act virtuously with wisdom and justice in the social
sphere, insofar as he’s practically able to do so. He simultaneously accepts,
though, that the outcome of his actions is not under his direct control.
There’s no guarantee that he’ll succeed in benefiting his fellow citizens, but
he does his best anyway. In a sense, the Stoic gets to have his cake and eat
it: to retain his emotional detachment while nevertheless taking action in the
world. Like Cato’s archer, his goal is to do what’s within his sphere of
control to the best of his ability while remaining somewhat aloof from the
outcome. Likewise, we can imagine that on taking command of the legions
in the north, Marcus might have said to himself something along the lines
of “I will quell the Marcomanni and protect Rome, Fate permitting.”
Later, Christians would take to adding D.V. (Deo volente, “God willing”)
to the end of their letters, and Muslims likewise say inshallah to this day.
There’s a wonderfully clear description of this sentiment in the New
Testament:
Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there,
carry on business and make money.” Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you
ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”4

Marcus Aurelius could easily have said those words in reference to the
Stoic Zeus. They remind us that nothing is certain in life. Nothing is
entirely under your control, except your own volition. Always accepting
this and preparing yourself in advance to meet both success and failure with
equanimity can help you avoid feeling angry, surprised, or frustrated when
events don’t turn out as you might have wished. It can also stop you from
worrying about things in anticipation of them going wrong. We naturally
focus our attention on what’s most important to us. Stoics treat their own
judgments and actions as the only thing truly good or bad. That inevitably
shifts focus to the present and lessens emotional investment in the past and
future. The worried mind is always getting too far ahead of itself; it is
always in suspense over the future. The Stoic Sage, by contrast, is grounded
in the here and now.
Marcus uses the analogy of a blazing fire to describe the wise man acting
with the reserve clause. Imagine a fire so intense that its flames naturally
consume everything cast upon them. Likewise, the mind of the Sage, acting
with the reserve clause, adapts itself, without hesitation, to whatever befalls
him. Whether he meets with success or failure, he makes good use of his
experience. Stoics can only be obstructed externally, not internally, as long
as they attach the caveat “Fate permitting” to their desires. For instance,
when people disagreed with Marcus, he first tried to persuade them to see
things from his perspective. However, if they persisted in obstructing what
he believed to be a just course of action, he remained calm and transformed
the obstacle into an opportunity to exercise some other virtue, such as
patience, restraint, or understanding. His equanimity remained intact as
long as he never desired what was beyond his grasp, which constitutes one
of the foundations of the Stoic remedy for worry and anxiety.5
Indeed, Marcus goes so far as to say that if you don’t act with the reserve
clause in mind, then any failure immediately becomes an evil to you or a
potential source of distress. By contrast, if you accept that the outcome
couldn’t have been other than it was and wasn’t under your direct control,
then you should suffer no harm or frustration. In this way, the mind is saved

from anxiety and preserved in its natural equanimity, like the sacred sphere
described by the pre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles, “round and true,”
touched by neither fire nor steel, tyrant nor public censure.6 The poet
Horace also employed this image of the pure sphere when describing the
Stoic ideal of a wise man who is master of himself, undaunted by poverty,
chains, or death, defying his passions and looking down on positions of
power. A man “complete in himself, smooth and round, who prevents
extraneous elements clinging to his polished surface, who is such that when
Fortune attacks him she maims only herself.”7 Misfortune gains no foothold
in his mind because he remains detached from external events, refusing to
invest them with any intrinsic value. We could also simply describe this as
“adopting a philosophical attitude” toward the outcome of our actions:
being resigned to whatever happens and remaining unperturbed come what
may.
THE PREMEDITATION OF ADVERSITY

If every action is to be undertaken with the reserve clause, an acceptance
that we may fail, then it follows that we should anticipate a whole range of
setbacks that can potentially befall us. Indeed, the Stoics broaden this
strategy, preparing themselves to cope with adversity by patiently
visualizing every major type of misfortune, one at a time, as if it were
already happening to them. They might picture themselves already in exile,
in poverty, bereaved, or suffering from a terrible illness. As we’ll see, going
one step further and anticipating your own death plays a very special role in
Stoicism. The technique of exposing yourself to stressful situations
repeatedly in small doses so that you build up a more general resistance to
emotional disturbance is known in behavioral psychology as “stress
inoculation.” It’s like inoculating yourself against a virus, and it’s similar to
what we’ve come to think of as resilience building.
Seneca calls this praemeditatio malorum, or the “premeditation of
adversity.” The clearest example of this prospective meditation strategy in
The Meditations comes when Marcus describes part of his morning routine
—preparing himself for the day ahead by anticipating various obstacles.
Whereas other Stoics focus on the threat of disease, poverty, exile, and so

on, Marcus is clearly more concerned with facing interpersonal problems,
such as dishonesty, ingratitude, or betrayal. He imagines himself
encountering a variety of difficult people in order to accustom himself to
coping with them.
Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful,
arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.8

It’s easy to see how this passage might relate to his life as emperor.
Marcus certainly had enemies in the Senate, a faction opposing his military
policy, and he later faced a full-scale civil war. He says that he was
surrounded at court by individuals who didn’t share his values and who
were hostile toward him; some even wished him dead. However, the
Marcomannic Wars were themselves about treachery and deceit. King
Ballomar of the Marcomanni was a Roman client and ally. Yet he secretly
conspired for years to launch his surprise attack deep into Italy, bringing
war to the very doorstep of Rome itself. He seized his chance at the height
of the Antonine Plague, when the Romans were weak and troops normally
garrisoned along the Danube were still returning from the Parthian War. It
was a huge betrayal. So when we read this famous passage from The
Meditations, we should bear in mind that Marcus was using Stoicism to
prepare himself to deal calmly not only with petty nuisances but also with
major political and military crises that changed the shape of European
history. All of Rome was thrown into a panic by the news that a massive
horde of barbarian warriors was plundering its way through Italy. Marcus
responded calmly and with self-assurance. He used Stoic exercises like the
premeditation of adversity to ready himself for sudden crises that would
have left other men reeling.
Premeditation of adversity can be useful in confronting anger and other
negative emotions, but its techniques are particularly suited to treat fear and
anxiety. The Stoics defined fear as the expectation that something bad is
going to happen, which is virtually identical to the definition originally
proposed by Aaron T. Beck, the founder of modern cognitive therapy. Fear
is essentially a future-focused emotion, so it’s natural that we should
counter it by addressing our thoughts concerning the future. Inoculating

ourselves against stress and anxiety through the Stoic premeditation of
adversity is one of the most useful techniques for building general
emotional resilience, which is what psychologists call the long-term ability
to endure stressful situations without becoming overwhelmed by them.
Aesop’s fable “The Boar and the Fox” is all about building resilience.
One day a fox was walking through the woods when he spotted a wild boar
sharpening his tusks against the stump of a tree. The fox found this
hilarious and made fun of the boar for worrying about nothing. When he
finally stopped laughing, he asked, “Why are you being so fretful, you fool?
There’s nobody here for you to fight!” The boar smiled and said, “True, but
when one day I do hear the huntsmen coming, it will be too late then to
prepare for battle.” The moral is that in times of peace, we should prepare
for war if we want to be ready to defend ourselves. The Stoics likewise used
moments of leisure to prepare themselves to remain calm in the face of
adversity.
EMOTIONAL HABITUATION

Of course, we don’t always know what specific challenges we’re about to
face in life. However, your general emotional resilience can be developed
by training yourself in advance to cope with a broad enough range of
situations. That’s precisely what the Stoics did through the premeditation of
adversity strategy. One of the most robustly established findings in the
entire field of modern psychotherapy research is the fact that anxiety tends
to abate naturally during prolonged exposure to feared situations, under
normal conditions. That’s been the basis of evidence-based phobia
treatments since the 1950s, and it’s also an integral part of modern
treatment protocols for other, more complex forms of anxiety, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD).
Take a person with a severe cat phobia, for instance, and place them in a
room with some cats. Their heart rate will go up, probably almost doubling
within a few seconds. But what happens next? Well, what goes up must
come down … If they remain in the room and do nothing but wait, their
anxiety will typically diminish over time. That may take as little as five

minutes or maybe as long as half an hour or more. Nevertheless, in most
cases, their heart rate will eventually go back down to something
approaching its normal resting level. If you bring them back the next day
and put them in the room with the cats once again, you’ll typically notice
that their heart rate will go back up but not as high as before, and it will
tend to lower more quickly. If you repeat this exercise for several days, then
they will become emotionally “habituated” to the cats, their anxiety having
permanently reduced to a normal or negligible level.
That this basic truth was understood long ago is nicely illustrated by
another of Aesop’s fables, called “The Fox and the Lion.” One day a fox
strolling through the woods spotted a lion—a creature she’d never seen
before. She froze with terror but stopped to watch from a distance before
slowly creeping away. The next day she went back to the same spot and saw
the lion again, but she was able to get closer than before, hiding behind a
bush for a while before making her escape. On the third day, the fox
returned, but this time she found the courage to walk right up to the lion and
say hello, and somehow the two became friends. The moral of the story is
that familiarity breeds not contempt but indifference. We can expect anxiety
to abate naturally with repeated exposure, under normal conditions.
What the Stoic literature doesn’t make clear, though, is that the feared
situation must be experienced for considerably longer than normal for
anxiety to properly habituate. In fact, if exposure is terminated too soon, the
technique may actually backfire and increase anxiety and sensitization to
the feared situation. So it’s important to compare what the Stoics
recommend to what we know from clinical research using similar
techniques.
Exposure therapy works best when the anxiety-provoking trigger is
physically present, like the cats in our example above. Therapists call this in
vivo, or “real-world,” exposure. However, anxiety also habituates almost as
reliably, in most cases, when the threat is merely imagined, something
known as in vitro, or “imaginal,” exposure. The Stoics realized that
exposure to imagined events can lead to emotional habituation in this way,
allowing anxiety to abate naturally. Their recommendation to regularly
picture catastrophic events, which we’ve called the premeditation of

adversity, is essentially a form of imaginal exposure therapy. Aesop’s fable
“The Fox and the Lion” shows that people have long grasped this
phenomenon, but it’s still quite remarkable to discover a philosophical
therapy employing it over two thousand years before it was rediscovered by
modern behavior therapists.
However, in the case of imaginal exposure, maintaining the image for
long enough requires considerable patience and concentration, especially
when practiced as a form of self-help without the aid of a therapist. Many
people find that it helps to imagine the anxiety-provoking situation as if it
were a short movie clip, or sequence of events, with a beginning, middle,
and end, lasting roughly a minute or so. They can then replay the same
scene repeatedly, in their mind’s eye, for five to fifteen minutes or even
longer. For example, someone who is anxious about losing their job might
visualize being called into their boss’s office, told that they’re being sacked
or made redundant, and later clearing their desk and leaving, etc. They’d
picture this as a short movie, perhaps repeatedly on a loop. As noted, the
actual amount of time required varies, but anxiety should have reduced to at
least half its initial level before ending the exercise. The most common
reason for failure is that people terminate these sorts of exposure exercises
before their emotions have had enough time to habituate. It takes patience,
in other words.
Therapists will often ask their clients to rate their discomfort or anxiety
level while picturing a scene on a scale from zero to ten, or as a percentage.
Clients then re-rate their anxiety every few minutes during repeated
imaginal exposure until it has sufficiently reduced. For example, the cat
phobic might patiently visualize stroking a cat over and over, until their
anxiety reduces from 80 percent to at least 40 percent or even lower if
possible (where 100 percent would be the most severe anxiety they could
imagine feeling and 0 percent would be no anxiety at all). Nota bene: It’s
important to emphasize that any technique that involves imagining
upsetting scenes should be approached with caution by individuals who
suffer from mental health problems or those vulnerable to being
emotionally overwhelmed, such as sufferers of panic attacks. When doing
this alone, don’t pick an image that’s going to be too much for you to

handle, such as a traumatic memory of sexual assault, for instance—that’s
where the support of a qualified psychotherapist may be necessary.
Nevertheless, most people are capable of safely confronting ordinary fears
and worries in their imagination.
SPONTANEOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGE

Emotional habituation is the most important process to take place during
imaginal exposure, such as the premeditation of adversity. However, we can
activate a surprising number of other beneficial psychological processes
when we patiently and repeatedly picture stressful events. Therapy clients
who are asked to mentally review emotional situations in this way may
exhibit one or more of the following changes:
1. Emotional habituation, as described above, where anxiety or other
feelings naturally wear off over time and become blunted through
exposure to the feared situation.
2. Emotional acceptance, where we gradually reduce our struggle
against unpleasant feelings such as pain or anxiety, come to view
them with greater indifference, and learn to live with them—
something that, paradoxically, often greatly alleviates emotional
distress.
3. Cognitive distancing, where we increasingly view thoughts and
beliefs with detachment: we begin to notice that it’s not things
themselves that upset us but our judgments about them.
4. Decatastrophizing, where we gradually reappraise our judgments
about the severity of a situation, of how awful it seems,
downgrading it by going from “What if this happens? How will I
cope?” to “So what if this happens? It’s not the end of the world.”
5. Reality testing, where we reappraise our assumptions about a
situation to make them progressively more realistic and objective;
for example, reevaluating the probability of the worst-case
scenario or that something bad will even happen at all.
6. Problem-solving, where repeatedly reviewing an event leads us to
creatively figure out a solution to some problem facing us—

perhaps like Marcus and his generals’ paradoxical idea of
deliberately marching their legionaries into a Sarmatian ambush
in order to spring a trap on the enemy.
7. Behavioral rehearsal, where our perception of our ability to cope
improves as we practice, in our mind’s eye, employing skills and
coping strategies in an increasingly refined manner—for example,
mentally rehearsing assertive ways to deal with unfair criticism
until we’re more confident about doing so in reality. This can take
the form of modeling the behavior of others whose way of coping
we admire and want to emulate—we imagine how they would act
and then picture ourselves doing something similar.
I’ve found that informing patients that other people often experience
these sorts of changes is helpful because it can make the same processes
more noticeable in their own mind and more likely to happen
spontaneously. Of course, it’s also possible to deliberately utilize these
psychological mechanisms by employing various psychological techniques.
For instance, in addition to the premeditation of adversity, Marcus refers to
the repeated use of two particularly important Stoic exercises that resemble
cognitive distancing and decatastrophizing in modern psychotherapy. We’ve
mentioned these already, and now we’re ready to consider their use in
relation to worry and anxiety.
THE INNER CITADEL

Although Marcus says little about anxiety explicitly, he often talks about the
kind of peace that Stoicism offers, and his words obviously have
implications for the Stoic therapy of anxiety. During his early reign, after
the death of Antoninus, he took trips to his holiday villas in Italy to get a
break from the worries of the Parthian War and running the empire. We can
see from his letters to Fronto that he was wrestling with the whole idea of
taking time away from work, feeling instead that it was his duty to attend to
state business even though his friends advised him that retreats were
necessary for his health.

By the time he wrote The Meditations, during the Marcomannic Wars,
pleasant retreats were a thing of the past, and his life was spent far from
Rome. Marcus still found himself pining after his beautiful holiday villas,
such as Antoninus’s family home at Lorium on the Italian coast, where
Marcus spent much of his youth. He says that at times, like many other
people, he feels a strong desire to get away from things and retreat to the
peace of the countryside, seashore, or mountains.9 However, he tells himself
that feeling the need to escape from life’s stresses in this way is a sign of
weakness. It might be what the Stoics called a “preferred indifferent,” but
escape is not something we should demand from life or feel we really need
as a coping tool—that sort of dependence on being able to escape from
stressful situations just creates its own problems. Marcus tells himself that
he doesn’t literally need to get away from it all because true inner peace
comes from the nature of our thoughts rather than pleasant natural
surroundings. He tells himself that resilience comes from his ability to
regain his composure wherever he finds himself. This is the “inner citadel”
to which he can retreat, even on the frigid battlefields of the northern
campaign.
Marcus returns, in particular, to the analogy of a mountain retreat several
times. He reminds himself that it makes no difference where he is or what
he’s doing; the time left for him in life is short, and he should therefore
learn to “live as though on a mountaintop,” regardless of his circumstances.
In fact, everything that troubles us here is just as it would be on a hilltop, by
the seashore, or anywhere else—what matters is how we choose to view it.10
The Stoic can live with contentment and joy in his heart this way, even if
men are against him and his physical environment is torturous. Wherever
we find ourselves, our judgments are still free, and they are the seat of our
passions.
In order to achieve this sense of inner peace, Marcus tells himself to
frequently retreat not to the hilltops but to his own faculty of reason,
thereby rising above external events and purifying his mind of attachment
to them. He believes that to do this effectively he must reflect, in particular,
on two concise but fundamental Stoic principles:11

1. Everything that we see is changing and will soon be gone, and we
should bear in mind how many things have already changed over
time, like the waters of streams flowing ceaselessly past—an idea
that we can call the contemplation of impermanence.
2. External things cannot touch the soul, but our disturbances all
arise from within. Marcus means that things don’t upset us, but
our value judgments about them do. However, we can regain our
composure by separating our values from external events using
the strategy we’ve called cognitive distancing.
In other words, peace of mind can be achieved even in the chaos of the
battlefield—as Socrates reputedly showed—or in the clamor of the Senate,
as long as we keep our mind in good order. Marcus concludes by
condensing this into six Greek words, perhaps quoted from a previous
author, which we might translate as The universe is change: life is opinion.
COGNITIVE DISTANCING FOR ANXIETY

The second of these two fundamental techniques for securing peace is
familiar to us as cognitive distancing. We can employ it in response to realworld situations or during the sort of premeditation, or imaginal exposure
technique, described earlier. Although we know that anxiety habituates
naturally through repeated exposure and the Stoics presumably must have
observed this during their use of regular premeditation, their real goal was
to change our opinions about external events, not just our feelings.
Gaining cognitive distance is, in a sense, the most important aspect of
Stoic anxiety management. This is what Marcus meant by “life is opinion”:
that the quality of our life is determined by our value judgments, because
those shape our emotions. When we deliberately remind ourselves that we
project our values onto external events and that how we judge those events
is what upsets us, we gain cognitive distance and recover our mental
composure.
DECATASTROPHIZING AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF IMPERMANENCE

The first basic technique for attaining peace, described by Marcus above, is
related to decatastrophizing, or learning to downgrade the perceived
severity of a threat from “total catastrophe” to a more realistic level. Again,
decatastrophizing can be applied in real situations or in imagined ones,
during the premeditation of adversity. For example, suppose you’re worried
that you’ll fail an important exam and you become very anxious, feeling
that failure would be the end of the world, a total disaster.
Decatastrophizing would entail reevaluating the situation in a more
balanced manner so that it seems less overwhelming and you’re more able
to identify potential ways of coping. Viewing things in a more moderate and
realistic way like this tends to reduce anxiety. You might experience
setbacks, but it’s an exaggeration to talk as though they’re the end of the
world.
As it happens, most people find it easier to visualize a scene if they write
down a description of it first and perhaps review it later. Staying with the
example above, you might write a page or so about losing your job: how it
begins, being told the bad news, the immediate aftermath, etc. People often
find that reading their description aloud several times before attempting to
visualize it helps them to clarify the details and picture the scene more
vividly. As always, it’s important to leave out emotive language (“They just
treated me like trash and threw me out on my backside.”) or value
judgments (“This is totally unfair!”). Just stick to the facts as accurately and
objectively as possible.
Asking yourself “What next?” a few times can move your focus past the
most distressing part of the scene and take away its catastrophic
appearance. For example, what would happen after losing your job? It
might be tough for a while, but eventually you’d find something else and
your life would move on. Another simple and powerful technique is to ask
yourself how you would feel about the situation that worries you in ten or
twenty years’ time, looking back on it from the future. It’s an example of a
more general strategy known as “time projection.” In other words, you can
help yourself develop a philosophical attitude toward adversity by asking,
“If this will seem trivial to me twenty years from now, then why shouldn’t I
view it as trivial today instead of worrying about it as if it’s a catastrophe?”

You’ll often find that shifting your perspective in terms of time can change
how you feel about a setback by making it seem less catastrophic.
WORRY POSTPONEMENT

In recent decades, researchers and clinicians have gained a better
understanding of the ways in which excessive worrying can perpetuate
anxiety. By “worry” they mean something quite specific: an anxious
process exhibiting a particular style of thinking. Worried thinking is
perseverative—it goes on and on. It tends to involve “What if?” thoughts
about feared catastrophes: “What if they get so angry they fire me? What if
I can’t get another job? How will I pay for my kids’ college?” These
questions often feel as if they’re unanswerable. One just leads to another, in
a chain reaction, which goes on and on, fueling anxiety. Severe worrying
can often feel out of control, but, perhaps surprisingly, it’s actually a
relatively conscious and voluntary type of thinking. People sometimes don’t
even realize that what they’re doing is worrying. They may confuse it with
problem-solving, believing that they’re trying to “figure out a solution”
when in fact they’re just going in circles making their anxiety worse and
worse.
There’s a tendency, ironically, for people struggling with anxiety to try
too hard to control involuntary aspects of the emotion while neglecting to
take control of the voluntary aspects. We’ve already discussed how the
Stoics acknowledged that our initial emotional reactions are often
automatic. We should accept these as natural, view them with indifference,
and accept them without a struggle rather than try to suppress them. On the
other hand, we should learn to suspend the voluntary thoughts we have in
response to these initial feelings and the situation that triggered them. In the
case of worrying, perhaps surprisingly, that’s usually just a matter of
noticing we’re doing it and stopping.
One of the leading researchers on the psychology of worry, Thomas D.
Borkovec, carried out a groundbreaking study on “worry postponement.”
He asked a group of college students to spot the times during a four-week
period when they began to worry about something and to respond by
postponing thinking about it any further until a specified “worry time” later

in the day. Using this simple technique, the subjects were able to reduce the
time spent worrying by almost half, and other symptoms of anxiety were
also reduced. Worry postponement is now a central component of most
CBT protocols for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a psychiatric
condition characterized by severe, pathological worrying.12 However, we
can apply the same approach to ordinary, everyday worries like those of the
students in the research study.
The steps to follow in worry postponement build upon the general
framework that should be familiar to you by now:
1. Self-monitoring: Be constantly on the lookout for early warning
signs of worry, such as frowning or fidgeting in certain ways—
this awareness alone will often derail the habit of worrying.
2. If you are unable to address your anxiety immediately using Stoic
techniques, postpone thinking about it until your feelings have
abated naturally, returning to the problem at a specified “worry
time” of your choosing.
3. Let go of the thoughts without trying to actively suppress them—
instead, just tell yourself you’re setting them aside temporarily to
come back to them later at a specified time and place. Cognitive
distancing techniques can be helpful in this regard. You can also
write down a word or two on a piece of paper to remind yourself
of the thing you’re worried about, then fold it up and put it in
your pocket to address later.
4. Return your attention to the here and now, expanding your
awareness through your body and your surroundings, and try to
notice small details you’d overlooked before. Worry goes chasing
after future catastrophes and therefore requires inattention to the
present moment. Become grounded in the here and now instead:
“Lose your mind and come to your senses!”
5. Later, when you return to the worry, if it no longer seems
important, you might just leave it alone. Otherwise, visualize the
worst-case scenario or feared outcome that’s making you anxious,

using the technique of imaginal exposure or premeditation of
adversity.
6. Use cognitive distancing by telling yourself “It’s not things that
upset me but my judgments about them.” You can also
decatastrophize by describing the feared event in objective terms,
without emotive language or value judgments. Remind yourself
of its temporary nature by asking “What next?” and considering
how things will move on over time.
Stoics tell us to be constantly mindful of our actions and look out for
disturbing impressions, automatic thoughts, or images that pop into our
stream of consciousness. Instead of giving our assent to them and allowing
ourselves to be swept along by them into worry, we should tell ourselves
that they are just impressions and not the things they claim to represent. In
this way we gain cognitive distance from them and can postpone evaluating
them until we’re in a better frame of mind to deal with them. Chrysippus
reputedly said that with the passage of time, “emotional inflammation
abates” and as reason returns, finding room to function properly, it can then
expose the irrational nature of our passions.

In this chapter, we’ve looked at ways Stoics cope with worry and anxiety,
with a focus on the Stoic reserve clause and premeditation of adversity.
Many of the other techniques we mentioned in previous chapters are useful
for coping with anxiety, but Marcus mentions two in particular that allow us
to focus on the transience of upsetting events: cognitive distancing and
decatastrophizing. We also looked at how the modern evidence-based
technique of worry postponement resembles coping strategies described by
the ancient Stoics.
Indeed, Stoicism provides some very powerful ways of overcoming fear
and anxiety, which often resemble those supported by research on modern
CBT. Remaining grounded in the present, spotting worry when it begins,
and gaining cognitive distance from worry are healthy and effective ways of
coping. We can also take advantage of the natural process of emotional

habituation by patiently facing our fears in our imagination long enough for
our anxiety to abate. This is an inevitable benefit of the Stoic technique
called “premeditation of adversity,” but we can also help ourselves do this
by employing verbal decatastrophizing and describing the feared event in
very calm and objective language, suspending the value judgments
responsible for our distress.
After decades of training in these and other Stoic techniques, Marcus
was able to go calmly and confidently to the defense of the empire. The
majority of people in Rome were thrown into total panic, fearing an
impending catastrophe at the hands of the barbarian hordes invading Italy
from the north. As emperor, Marcus faced one setback after another, and he
must have felt out of his depth at times. However, he calmly persevered in
the face of great adversity. Slowly, with his trusted generals Pompeianus
and Pertinax by his side, Marcus began to gain the upper hand over the
northern tribes.
The more warlike Zanticus replaced King Bandaspus of the Iazyges, but
as the war turned against him, he finally surrendered and sued for peace in
June 175 AD. Marcus was shortly afterward acclaimed emperor for the
eighth time and granted the title Sarmaticus, conqueror of the Sarmatians.
It’s reported that 100,000 Roman prisoners were freed as a result of the
victory. Marcus resettled many thousands of the Germanic tribesmen and
women in Italy rather than kill or enslave them, albeit with mixed success.
This wasn’t an option with the nomadic and warlike Sarmatians, though.
Instead, Marcus conscripted eight thousand of their horsemen into the
Roman army, forming an elite auxiliary cavalry unit, most of whom were
sent to garrison the Roman forts in Britain. He wrote in his notes that men
who take pride in capturing Sarmatians as though they were fish in a net are
no better than thieves or robbers.13
However, Marcus had to rush the final stages of the First Marcomannic
War and the ensuing peace negotiations with the Sarmatians because an
even greater threat suddenly loomed on the horizon. The Stoic precepts and
practices that Marcus had honed during the First Marcomannic War were
about to be put to the test once again. Far away in the east, a rival had
staked his claim to the imperial throne, and that could mean only one thing:

Romans were about to be divided by civil war, which threatened to tear the
empire apart.

7.
TEMPORARY MADNESS

May 175 AD. A nervous courier hands over a letter to Gaius Avidius
Cassius, commander of the Syrian legions and governor general of the
eastern provinces. It contains only a single Greek word, which to his
consternation reads emanes (“You’re mad”—you’ve lost your mind).
Cassius is furious and tears it to pieces. He’s not someone to be trifled
with. In fact, his brutality has become notorious. One of his favorite
punishments is to chain men together in groups of ten and let them drown in
the middle of a river. Rumors circulated that he once had dozens of the
enemy bound to a pole nearly two hundred feet high and set it ablaze so that
for miles around their countrymen could watch them burn alive. Even by
the brutal standards of the Roman army, that was considered horrifically
cruel. He was renowned among his own troops as a strict disciplinarian,
sometimes to the point of savagery. He cut off the hands of deserters or
broke their legs and hips, leaving them crippled. Letting them live on in
misery was his way of warning others against disobeying his orders.
However, Cassius was also a distinguished military hero. Next to the
emperor, he was the second most important commander in the Roman army,
perhaps even the second most powerful man in the whole empire.
Cassius’s iron grip on his troops was legendary, and it made him
indispensable to Rome. Marcus and Cassius had long been family friends,
although Cassius was rumored to criticize the emperor behind his back.
Marcus would tell his courtiers, “It is impossible to make men exactly as

one would wish them to be; we must use them such as they are.” His
reputation for clemency and forgiveness stood in total contrast to Cassius’s
severity. Nevertheless, despite their opposing characters, Marcus placed his
trust in Cassius as a general. During the Parthian War, while Lucius Verus
indulged his vices at a safe distance from any actual fighting, Cassius
achieved one stunning victory after another, relentlessly pursuing King
Vologases deep into Parthian territory. He quickly rose to become Lucius’s
second in command. Near the end of the war, however, he allowed his men
to sack the twin cities of Ctesiphon and Seleucia, on the River Tigris,
where, it was claimed, they contracted the plague. The returning troops
brought it home to their legionary bases throughout the provinces, and from
there it ravaged the empire. Cassius was rewarded, however, for driving the
Parthians out of Syria by being appointed imperial legate (a governor with
supreme command) of the province, answerable directly to the emperors. A
few years later, in 169 AD, the Emperor Lucius’s untimely demise left a
power vacuum waiting to be filled.
In 172 AD, while Marcus was occupied with the First Marcomannic War,
on the northern frontier, a tribe called the Bucoli, or “Herdsmen,” who came
from the northwest region of the Nile Delta near Alexandria, instigated a
revolt against the Roman authorities. This was a major emergency requiring
Cassius to enter Egypt with his two Syrian legions, which meant he had to
be granted imperium, supreme military authority equal to that of the
emperor in his absence. Native Egyptians had borne the brunt of tax
increases required to fund Marcus’s war in the north. As a result, more and
more of them had turned to banditry, and eventually, out of desperation,
they formed a rebel army, led by a charismatic young warrior-priest called
Isidorus. The story goes that a handful of these men disguised themselves in
women’s clothing and approached a Roman centurion, pretending that they
were going to pay him a ransom of gold for their captured husbands. They
ambushed him, however, and then captured and sacrificed another officer,
reputedly swearing an oath over his bloody entrails before ritually
devouring them. News of this reputed act of terrorism quickly spread across
Egypt, and a general uprising ensued.

The Bucoli rapidly gained enough support from other tribes to surround
and attack Alexandria. When the Egyptian legion confronted the tribesmen
in a pitched battle, the vastly outnumbered Romans suffered a humiliating
defeat. The Bucoli and their allies continued to besiege Alexandria for
months while plague and famine devastated the city. They would have
sacked Alexandria had Cassius and his troops not been sent from Syria to
relieve the Alexandrian garrison and put down the uprising. He faced so
many tribal warriors, though, that he dared not launch a direct counterattack
even with three legions under his command. Instead, he chose to bide his
time, sowing dissent and instigating quarrels among the enemy tribes until
he was finally able to divide and conquer them. Cassius’s reward was to
retain imperium throughout the eastern provinces, granting him a unique
status and set of powers, dangerously close to those of an emperor.
At the age of forty-five, Cassius had become a hero to his countrymen as
a result of his dramatic military victories. His authority was further
enhanced by his noble lineage: his mother, Julia Cassia Alexandra, was one
of the Cassii, an ancient Roman family famous for their old-fashioned
toughness. She was a princess, descended on her father’s side from King
Herod the Great of Judea and on her mother’s from Augustus, the first
Roman emperor. She also claimed descent from another Roman client-king,
Antiochus IV Epiphanes of Commagene, making Cassius a member of the
Seleucid imperial dynasty.
In short, Cassius was born to rule. Given his noble pedigree and
celebrated military victories, he doubtless viewed himself as a natural
successor to the Emperor Lucius Verus. However, far to the north, Marcus
had promoted Claudius Pompeianus, another Syrian general, and one from
much humbler stock. Pompeianus had already distinguished himself during
the Parthian War and subsequently married Marcus’s daughter Lucilla, the
widow of Lucius Verus. He served as the most senior general on the
northern frontier during the Marcomannic Wars and became the emperor’s
right-hand man. It was even rumored that Marcus had invited Pompeianus
to become Caesar, although for some reason he declined. It seems likely
that Cassius found the idea intolerable that a commoner from his own
country might be promoted above him.

Cassius has steadily climbed the ladder of power since the day the
Emperor Lucius died. Now, in 175 AD, Cassius has been holding the
authority of an emperor in the east for three years; he has one rung left to
climb, and Marcus Aurelius is the only person standing in his way. The
single word he holds in his hands, emanes, comes from Herodes Atticus, the
Sophist who tutored Marcus in Greek rhetoric as a youth. Herodes was
known for his eloquence in delivering elaborate speeches, but this letter had
the sort of laconic punch more typical of Stoics than Sophists. Only one
word was necessary to make his point. Driven by his lust for absolute
power, Cassius has rashly instigated a civil war that threatens to tear the
whole empire apart and engulf the lives of millions in bloodshed.
At the far side of the empire, over fifteen hundred miles away, an
exhausted dispatch rider arrives at the army camp at Sirmium, the capital of
Lower Pannonia (in modern-day Serbia). The soldiers who meet him rush
him straight to the emperor’s residence in the middle of the camp. It has
taken over ten days, using the emergency relay system, to get the news from
the east via Rome to the northern frontier. He hesitates before speaking. His
news is so astonishing that he can scarcely believe it himself: “My lord
Caesar, General Avidius Cassius has betrayed you … the Egyptian legion
have acclaimed him emperor!”
The courier has with him a letter from the Senate confirming the news:
on May 3, 175 AD, Avidius Cassius had been acclaimed emperor of Rome
by the Egyptian legion in Alexandria. “My lord, they’re telling everyone
that you’re dead,” the messenger explains. The news came from Publius
Martius Verus, governor of the Roman province of Cappadocia (in modernday Turkey). He had served with great distinction as a general along with
Cassius and Pompeianus in the Parthian War. Crucially, Martius Verus’s
alarming news comes with the reassurance that he and the three legions
under his command have declared their unwavering loyalty to Marcus.
However, Cassius reputedly has garnered support for his rebellion
throughout the region lying south of the Taurus mountain range, roughly
half the eastern empire. A number of senators at Rome who had opposed
the Marcomannic campaign have seized the opportunity to petition in favor
of Cassius. So far, though, the Senate as a whole remains loyal to Marcus.

Nevertheless, Cassius is a highly accomplished general with seven legions
under his command. He also controls Egypt, the breadbasket of the empire
and by far the wealthiest province in the east. Its capital, Alexandria, is the
second largest city and has the largest port in the empire. If exports from
Egypt are cut off, Rome will eventually run out of bread, leading to rioting
and looting. The fate of the empire therefore hangs in the balance.
Marcus, in fact, has recently been very sick, perhaps even close to death.
Aged fifty-four and widely perceived as frail and in poor health, he has long
been the subject of gossip at Rome. His wife, Faustina, had traveled back to
Rome several months earlier. Rumors say that she was frightened by the
possibility of Marcus’s imminent demise and urged Cassius to stake his
claim to the throne. Marcus’s only surviving son, Commodus, is thirteen
years old and acutely aware that if his father dies or the throne is usurped
before he reaches adulthood, his own life will be in grave peril. Faustina
had allegedly schemed that by preempting Marcus’s death, Cassius can
outmaneuver other pretenders to the throne and perhaps even safeguard the
succession of Commodus by marrying her. Others say that Cassius acted on
his own initiative, deliberately circulating bogus rumors of Marcus’s death
to seize power. Or perhaps he simply acted prematurely, not treasonously,
genuinely deceived by false intelligence that declared the emperor dead or
dying. The Senate was alarmed, though, and immediately declared Cassius
hostis publicus, a public enemy, seizing his assets and those of his family.
That has only served to escalate the conflict. Cassius must feel the situation
spiraling out of control. He can’t back down; civil war has become
inevitable.
Whatever Cassius’s motives, Marcus now finds himself confronting one
of the most serious crises of his reign. The emperor has recovered from his
latest bout of illness and wastes no time in responding to the sedition. He
looks over the faces of his generals. They already know that he must
prepare to leave the northern frontier and lead an army to the east with great
haste. Cassius’s legions may march against Rome itself in an effort to
secure his claim on the imperial throne. This looming threat has cast the
city into a state of total panic and emboldened Marcus’s critics in the

Senate. However, Marcus’s reputation with the mighty legions serving him
on the Danube is now unassailable.
The following morning, Marcus sends the dispatch rider on his way with
letters for the Senate in Rome, his ally Martius Verus in Cappadocia, and,
most importantly, Cassius in Egypt. His message is clear: the emperor
confirms that he is alive, in good health, and will soon return. Now he must
make rapid arrangements for peace in the north so that he will be free to
march southeast, reinforce the loyalists in Cappadocia, and quell unrest by
appearing in person. However, it would be premature to address his troops
about the incident until he knows that a civil war is unavoidable. They’re
still fighting pockets of resistance among the northern tribes, and he doesn’t
want the barbarians along the Danube getting wind of the crisis back home
while negotiations for peace are still underway.
In private, he continues to meditate on his reaction to the news. The
hardest thing to deal with is the uncertainty of the situation. Marcus
assumes that at some level Cassius believes he is doing the right thing: he
acts out of ignorance of what is genuinely right and wrong, for, as Socrates
and the Stoics taught, no man does wrong knowingly. Of course, it’s
precisely this philosophical attitude that Cassius resents in Marcus, because
to him forgiveness is merely a sign of weakness. It leads to a contest
between their personalities, two ways of ruling, and two philosophies of
life: one harsh, the other forgiving.
Several weeks have now passed since Marcus received the Senate’s
dispatch notifying him of events in Egypt. His first action on receiving
news of the rebellion was to summon his thirteen-year-old son, Commodus,
to Sirmium, where he took the toga virilis, officially making him an adult
Roman citizen in preparation for being acclaimed emperor. He is being
commended to the legions as Marcus’s natural heir in order to help quash
Cassius’s claim on the throne. The news must have reached Cassius that the
emperor was still alive, but there has been no word of him standing down.
However, the failure of Cassius’s rebellion to spread across the Taurus
mountain range into Cappadocia means he doesn’t have enough troops to be
confident of holding Syria against a major offensive by the loyalist army.
Nevertheless, rumor and unrest are growing in Marcus’s camp. The time

has come for the emperor to address his men and announce that they will be
marching southeast to join forces with Martius Verus in Cappadocia before
engaging Cassius’s main army in Syria.
Marcus prepares himself for the day ahead, contemplating the actions of
Cassius and the senators who are working against him. Marcus tells
himself, as always, that he must be ready to accept meddling, ingratitude,
violence, treachery, and envy.1 According to the Stoics, individuals are
bound to make moral errors, because the majority do not have a firm grasp
on the true nature of good and evil. Nobody is born wise, but rather we
must become so through education and training. Marcus believes that
philosophy has taught him right from wrong and the ability to understand
the nature of men like Cassius, who appear to act unjustly. He reminds
himself that even those who oppose him are his kin, not necessarily through
blood but because they are his fellow citizens in the universal community,
sharing the potential for wisdom and virtue. Even though they may act
unjustly, they cannot truly harm him because their actions cannot tarnish his
character. As long as Marcus understands this, he cannot be angry with
them or hate them. Those who oppose him have come into being, he says,
to work together with him, just as the upper and lower rows of our teeth
work together to grind our food. To turn against men like Cassius in anger,
or even to turn his back on them, would be contrary to reason and against
the law of Nature. Marcus reminds himself not to regard the rebel faction as
enemies but to view them as benignly as a physician does his patients. He
takes his time, in quiet contemplation, knowing how important it is to
preserve a rational frame of mind in the face of adversity, especially given
the tremendous power invested in him by the Roman people. As soon as
Marcus has finished these meditations, he dons the military cape.
Pompeianus and several other advisors meet him outside his room. It is time
for him to address the ranks of legionaries assembled in the center of the
camp.
Marcus greets them as his fellow soldiers. He says there’s no point
complaining or feeling bitter about the rebellion in the east. He accepts
whatever ensues as the will of Zeus. He asks them not to be angry with the
heavens, and assures them of his heartfelt regret that they must be engaged

in war after war in his service. He wishes that Cassius had come to him first
and argued his case before the army and the Senate. Astoundingly, Marcus
promises them that he would even have stepped down and relinquished the
empire without a struggle if he had been persuaded that it was for the
common good. However, it’s too late for that now, as war is already upon
them.
He reminds his troops that their reputation far surpasses that of the
eastern legions, and so they have reason to be optimistic. Although Cassius
is one of his most esteemed generals, he says, they have nothing to fear
from “an eagle at the head of jackdaws”—a comment that draws a few
somber laughs. It wasn’t really Cassius who won those famous victories,
after all, but the very soldiers who now stand before him. Moreover, loyal
Martius Verus will be by their side, a general no less accomplished than
Avidius Cassius. Marcus tells them of his hope that Cassius may still repent
now that he knows the emperor lives. He must assume that it was only
through mistakenly believing him to be dead that his once-loyal general
would have betrayed him in this manner. If not, and Cassius persists in his
rebellion, he will be forced to think again when he learns that Marcus
Aurelius is marching against him at the head of such a formidable army of
seasoned veterans from the north. (The Roman historian Cassius Dio
presents what he claims to be the original text of this remarkable speech.)
The legionaries gathered before Marcus know well enough that their
beloved sovereign and commander is a philosopher of the Stoic sect.
Nevertheless, what happens next must have left them stunned. Marcus
assures them that his greatest desire is to show clemency.
To forgive a man who has done wrong, to be still a friend to one who has trodden friendship
underfoot, to continue being faithful to one who has broken faith. What I say may perhaps
seem incredible to you, but you must not doubt it. For surely all goodness has not yet entirely
perished from among men, but there is still in us a remnant of the ancient virtue. However, if
anyone should disbelieve it, that merely strengthens my desire, in order that men may see
accomplished with their own eyes what no one would believe could come to pass. For this
would be the one profit I could gain from my present troubles, if I were able to bring the matter
to an honorable conclusion, and show all the world that there is a right way to deal even with
civil war.

This is not misfortune, in other words, but to bear it nobly is good
fortune. That was something Rusticus and the other Stoics had taught him
as a boy. There isn’t a trace of anger in Marcus’s words, although the news
of Cassius’s rebellion has turned Rome upside down and left the whole
empire in turmoil. The men serving under Marcus’s command know him
well enough to expect that he would respond with dignity and calm, even to
such a shocking betrayal as this. Even so, it must seem remarkable to the
average legionary, standing there in the mud that day, to hear the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius summarily pardon not only this usurper but also the rest of
those ranged against him.
Upon finishing his speech to the troops, Marcus instructs his secretary to
forward a copy to the Senate. He retires to his residence once again, closes
his eyes, and continues to meditate on how best to cope with the emerging
crisis, turning to his philosophy for guidance.
HOW TO CONQUER ANGER
Marcus did not have a completely placid disposition by nature—he had to
work on overcoming his temper. In the very first sentence of The
Meditations, he praises his grandfather for being so calm and mild
mannered, and throughout the rest of his notes, he keeps returning to the
problem of mastering one’s anger.2 We know that Marcus struggled with his
own feelings of anger and worked to become a more calm and reasonable
man because he says so. He concludes the first book of The Meditations by
thanking the gods that he never lapsed into offending his friends, family, or
teachers, even though he felt inclined to lose his temper at times. People
who suffer from fatigue and chronic pain, as Marcus did, can often be prone
to irritability and anger. It shouldn’t surprise us if a frail man who slept
poorly and was bothered by severe chest and stomach pains sometimes felt
irritated with the countless people who were trying to manipulate or deceive
him.
For Stoics, full-blown anger is an irrational and unhealthy passion that
we should never indulge. As we’ve seen, though, it’s human nature to have
some automatic feelings of irritation in response to life’s problems. The

Stoics consider these “proto-passions” inevitable and accept their
occurrence with an attitude of indifference. A Stoic might reasonably prefer
that someone behave differently. They might even take determined action to
stop them, as Marcus did when he mobilized his army to march against
Avidius Cassius. Being a Stoic clearly doesn’t mean being a passive
doormat. However, the wise man will not get upset about things that lie
beyond his direct control, such as other people’s actions. The Stoics
therefore have a variety of psychological techniques that they employ to
help them counteract feelings of anger and replace them with a more eventempered, but equally determined, attitude.
Dealing with feelings of anger by cultivating greater empathy and
understanding toward others is one of the major recurring themes of The
Meditations. Whereas modern psychotherapy typically focuses on anxiety
and depression, the Stoics concerned themselves more with the problem of
anger. Indeed, an entire book by Seneca titled On Anger, which survives
today, describes the Stoic theory and treatment of this passion in great
detail.
As in most aspects of life, Marcus’s supreme role model here was his
adoptive father. From the Emperor Antoninus he learned “gentleness” first
and foremost, and mildness of temperament. Antoninus exhibited “patient
tolerance” of those who harshly criticized his cautious handling of the
empire’s resources. Marcus specifically reminds himself of how gracefully
his adoptive father accepted the apology of a customs officer at Tusculum
on one occasion, and that this was typical of his gentle character. Unlike his
predecessor Hadrian, Antoninus was never rude, overbearing, or violent to
people, and he never lost his temper. He considered every situation on a
case-by-case basis, calmly, methodically, and consistently, as if doing so at
his leisure. Elsewhere we hear again of Antoninus’s gentle disposition and
“how he put up with those who found fault with him unfairly, finding no
fault with them in return” and “his forbearance towards those who openly
opposed his views, and his pleasure when somebody pointed out something
better.”3 The patience and gentleness Antoninus showed as a ruler were
among the most important virtues Marcus learned. Indeed, Marcus was

famous for remaining calm in the face of provocation. Nevertheless, he had
to practice and train himself to overcome his feelings of anger.
So what therapy did the Stoics prescribe? They believed that anger is a
form of desire: “a desire for revenge on one who seems to have done an
injustice inappropriately,” according to Diogenes Laertius. Speaking less
formally, we might say that anger typically consists in the desire to harm
someone because we think they’ve done wrong and deserve to be punished.
(Occasionally it might be more of a desire for someone else to harm them,
as in, “I hope someone teaches her a lesson!”) This is not unlike modern
cognitive theories of anger, which typically define it as based upon the
belief that a rule that is personally important to you has somehow been
violated. Anger stems from the idea that an injustice has been committed, or
someone has done something they shouldn’t have done. It’s often associated
with the impression that you’ve somehow been threatened or harmed by the
other person, making anger a close companion of fear: “He did something
to me that he shouldn’t have done—that was wrong!” Not surprisingly, the
Stoic antidote for anger resembles the general therapy applied to desire we
described earlier. So it’s worth briefly reviewing the typical steps in this
approach and considering how they would apply to this passion:
1. Self-monitoring. Spot early warning signs of anger, to nip it in
the bud before it escalates. For example, you might notice that
your voice begins to change, or that you frown or your muscles
tense, when you’re beginning to grow angry, or you may think of
someone’s actions as unjust or in violation of a personal rule.
(“How dare she say that to me!”)
2. Cognitive distancing. Remind yourself that the events
themselves don’t make you angry, but rather your judgments
about them cause the passion. (“I notice that I am telling myself
‘How dare she say that,’ and it’s that way of looking at things
that’s causing me to feel angry.”)
3. Postponement. Wait until your feelings of anger have naturally
abated before you decide how to respond to the situation. Take a
breath, walk away, and come back to it a few hours later. If you

still feel like you need to do something, then calmly decide upon
the best response; otherwise, just let it go and forget about it.
4. Modeling virtue. Ask yourself what a wise person such as
Socrates or Zeno would do. What virtues might help you to
respond wisely? In your case, it might be easier to think of a role
model you’re more familiar with, like Marcus Aurelius or
someone you’ve encountered in your own life. (“A wiser person
would try to empathize, put themselves in her shoes, and then
exercise patience when they’re responding…”)
5. Functional analysis. Picture the consequences of following anger
versus following reason and exercising virtues such as
moderation. (“If I let my anger guide me then I’ll probably just
yell at her and get into another argument, and things will get a lot
worse over time until we’re not speaking anymore. If I wait until
I’ve calmed down and then try to listen patiently, though, it might
be difficult at first but it will probably start to work better with
practice, and once she’s calmed down maybe she’ll begin
listening to my perspective.”)
The Stoics probably learned the ancient concept of postponing their
actions until anger has abated from the Pythagoreans, whose school was
nearly seven centuries old by Marcus’s time. They were known for never
speaking in anger but withdrawing for a while until their feelings had died
down. They would only give their response when they could do so calmly
and rationally. Today therapists sometimes call that taking a “time-out”
from anger in order to regain your composure.
In addition to these basic strategies, Marcus also describes a whole
repertoire of Stoic cognitive techniques, which focus on addressing the
underlying beliefs that cause our anger in the first place. These are different
ways of thinking about the situation: alternative perspectives. They could
be used at any time. However, it’s difficult to change your point of view
while you’re still in the grip of anger. In fact, one of the most common
mistakes we make is trying to challenge our angry thoughts when we’re not
in the best frame of mind to do so. Instead, use these thinking strategies

beforehand, in advance of facing situations that might provoke anger, or
after you’ve taken time to regain your composure. Marcus reminded
himself to contemplate some of these ideas first thing in the morning while
preparing to encounter difficult people during the day ahead.
In one of the most striking passages of The Meditations, Marcus
introduces a list of ten thinking strategies to use when “guarding against
being angry with others.”4 He describes these anger-management
techniques as ten gifts from Apollo and his nine Muses. Apollo is the god of
medicine and healing—the god of therapy, we might say—and these are
Stoic psychotherapeutic prescriptions. The Meditations contains numerous
additional references to the same methods, which help clarify what Marcus
had in mind.
1. WE ARE NATURALLY SOCIAL ANIMALS, DESIGNED TO HELP ONE ANOTHER

The first strategy Marcus describes using in response to anger involves
reminding himself of the Stoic doctrine that rational beings are inherently
social, designed to live in communities and to help one another in a spirit of
goodwill. As such, we have a duty to live wisely and harmoniously with our
fellow humans in order to fulfill our natural potential and to flourish.
In one of the most famous quotes from The Meditations, the opening
passage of book 2 mentioned earlier, Marcus describes mentally preparing
himself each morning to deal with troublesome people. He adds, “Nor can I
be angry with my kinsman nor hate him for we have come into being for
co-operation,” and that to obstruct one another by feeling resentment or
turning our back on others goes against our rational and social nature.
Indeed, he says that the good for a rational creature lies, partly, in having an
attitude of fellowship toward others. Marcus also goes so far as to claim
that ignoring our fellowship with others is a form of injustice, a vice, and an
impiety because it goes against Nature.5
The Stoic goal of living in concord, or harmony, with the rest of
mankind doesn’t mean that we should expect everyone to act like our
friend. On the contrary, we should be prepared to meet many foolish and
vicious people in life and to accept this as inevitable. We should not meet
disagreeable people and enemies with anger, but treat this as an opportunity

to exercise our own wisdom and virtue. Stoics think of troublesome people
as if they are a prescription from a physician, or a training partner we’ve
been assigned by a wrestling coach. We exist for one another, says Marcus,
and if we can’t educate those who oppose us, we have to learn at least to
tolerate them.6
These challenges will help us grow in virtue and become more resilient.
If no one ever tested your patience, then you’d lack an opportunity to
exhibit virtue in your relationships. In the Eulogium on Marcus Aurelius, an
eighteenth-century work of historical fiction closely based on the Roman
histories, the Stoic teacher Apollonius is portrayed saying, “There are
wicked men—they are useful to thee; without them, what need would there
be for virtues?”
2. CONSIDER A PERSON’S CHARACTER AS A WHOLE

The next strategy involves picturing the person you’re angry with in a more
rounded and complete manner—don’t just focus on the aspects of their
character or behavior you find most annoying. Marcus tells himself to
consider carefully the sort of people who typically offend him. He then
patiently imagines them in their daily lives: eating at their dinner tables,
sleeping in their beds, having sex, relieving themselves, and so on. He
considers how they can be arrogant, overbearing, and angry, but he also
contemplates times when they’ve been enslaved by other desires.7 The idea
is that we should broaden our awareness, not only thinking of the person’s
actions that offend us but of the other person as a whole, remembering that
nobody is perfect. As we widen our perspective, we’re likely to dilute our
anger toward them. Doing so can be seen as a variation of the depreciation
by analysis technique.
Indeed, Marcus says that when others hate, blame, or slander you, you
should imagine looking into their souls and understanding what kind of
people they really are. The more you understand them, the more their
hostility toward you will seem misguided and powerless to offend you. He
seems to have viewed Cassius in this way, which probably helped Marcus
respond calmly to the sudden crisis of the civil war, whereas the Senate
offered a knee-jerk reaction.

Marcus says that in addition to putting yourself in the other person’s
shoes, you should analyze their character in a manner that gets straight to
the core questions: what kind of people do they want to please, for what
purpose, and through what kind of actions? What are their guiding
principles in life, what do they busy themselves doing, how do they spend
their time? You should imagine their souls laid bare before you, with all
their errors exposed. If you can picture this, eventually it will seem absurd
to you that their blame or praise ever carried any real authority.8 Indeed, the
wise man only really pays attention to the opinions of those “living in
agreement with Nature,” and so he is continually mindful of what sort of
men he’s dealing with. He understands who they are “at home and abroad,
by night and in the day, in what vices they wallow and with whom.”9
The Stoics believed that vicious people fundamentally lack self-love and
are alienated from themselves. We must learn to empathize with them and
see them as the victims of misguided beliefs or errors of judgment, not as
malicious. Marcus says that you should contemplate how they are blinded
by their own mistaken opinions and compelled by them to act as they do—
they don’t know any better. If you realize that, it will be easier to ignore
their censure, forgive them, and yet oppose their actions when necessary. To
understand all is to forgive all, as the saying goes.
3. NOBODY DOES WRONG WILLINGLY

This follows on from the previous point. It’s a statement of one of the
central paradoxes of Socrates’s philosophy and was embraced by the Stoics:
no man does evil knowingly, which also entails that no man does it
willingly. Marcus gave Cassius the benefit of the doubt by assuming that at
some level the usurper believed he was doing the right thing and was
simply mistaken. In The Meditations, he says you should view others’
actions in terms of a simple dichotomy: either they are doing what is right
or doing what is wrong. If they are doing what is right, then you should
accept it and cease to be annoyed with them. Let go of your anger and learn
from them. However, if they are doing what is wrong, then you should
assume it’s because they don’t know any better. As Socrates pointed out,
nobody wants to make mistakes or be deceived; all reasoning creatures

inherently desire the truth. So if someone is genuinely mistaken about what
is right, you should, if anything, feel sorry for them.
Everyone resents being called vicious or dishonorable. In some sense,
they believe that what they’re doing is right, or at least acceptable. No
matter how perverse that conclusion may seem, it’s justified in their own
mind. If we constantly think of others as being mistaken rather than simply
malicious, as deprived of wisdom against their wishes, we will inevitably
deal more gently with them. Marcus therefore says that whenever you
believe someone has wronged you, you should first consider what
underlying opinions they hold about what’s right and wrong. Once you
really understand their thinking, you’ll have no excuse for being surprised
at their actions, which should naturally weaken your feelings of anger.10
Errors of judgment compel people just as much as illness or insanity, and
we learn to make allowances for such people and forgive them on that basis.
In the same way, we don’t judge children harshly when they make mistakes
because they don’t know better. However, adults still make the same moral
errors as children. They don’t want to be ignorant, but they act as such
unwittingly and unintentionally.
Marcus thinks the rest of humanity deserves our love insofar as they are
our kin. Yet they also deserve our compassion, he says, insofar as they are
ignorant of good and evil, a handicap as severe as visual blindness. Our
moral errors lead us into passions such as anger that easily spiral out of
control. We should tell ourselves that other people are compelled by their
ignorance to act as they do, and let go of our anger. When faced with
someone whose behavior appears objectionable, Epictetus therefore advised
his students simply to repeat this maxim to themselves: “It seemed right to
him.”11
4. NOBODY IS PERFECT, YOURSELF INCLUDED

Remembering that other people are human, and flawed, can help you to
receive criticism (or praise) from them in a more balanced and less
emotional way. In a similar manner, reminding yourself that you’re not
perfect either—none of us are—can help you to moderate your feelings of
anger. It’s a double standard to criticize other people without

acknowledging our own imperfections. Marcus therefore reminds himself
that he too does many things that are wrong, and he is just like others in that
regard. He actually recommends that whenever we’re offended by the faults
of another, we should treat it as a signal to pause and immediately turn our
attention to our own character, reflecting on the similar ways in which we
go wrong.12 He makes the very honest psychological observation that he
often refrains from wrongdoing himself only because he’s afraid of the
consequences or worried about his reputation. Often all that holds us back
from committing one vice is another vice, he says (another idea that goes
back at least to Socrates). Many people refrain from crime, for instance,
because they’re afraid of being caught, not because they’re virtuous. So
even if we do not engage in the same wrongdoing as others, the inclination
may still be there. Marcus was willing to hear Cassius out because, despite
being emperor, he didn’t consider himself beyond reproach.
There are no gurus in Stoicism. Even the founders of the school—Zeno,
Cleanthes, and Chrysippus—don’t claim that they were perfectly wise.
They believe we’re all foolish, vicious, and to some extent enslaved to our
passions. The ideal Sage is perfect by definition, but he’s a hypothetical
ideal, like the notion of a Utopian society. Ironically, the very anger we feel
toward those who offend us can itself be seen as evidence of fallibility on
our part. Our anger proves that we too are capable of doing the wrong thing
under the influence of strong emotions. Remembering that fallibility is the
common lot of mankind—including you—can help diminish feelings of
anger. When you point your finger in anger at someone else, remember that
three fingers on the same hand point back in your own direction.
5. YOU CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN OF OTHER PEOPLE’S MOTIVES

We can’t read other people’s minds, so we shouldn’t jump to conclusions
about what their intentions are. However, without knowing someone’s
intentions, we can never really be sure they’re doing wrong. People can do
things that appear bad for what they believe are good reasons. Marcus was
actually an experienced judge in the Roman court of law as well as a good
judge of character. He reminds himself that it’s necessary to learn a great
many things about another person before we can deliver a firm opinion

concerning their personality and motives—and even then we’re basing our
conclusions on probability. In the same way, when it came to the civil war,
Marcus took it for granted that he could never really know for certain what
was in Cassius’s heart.
By contrast, anger assumes an unwarranted certainty about the motives
of other people. Cognitive therapists call this the fallacy of “mindreading”—leaping to conclusions about other people’s motives although
they are always somewhat veiled from us. You should always remain open
to the possibility that the other person’s intentions are not in the wrong.13
Consider that other plausible interpretations of their actions exist. Keeping
an open mind will help you dilute your feelings of anger.
6. REMEMBER WE ALL WILL DIE

Marcus tells himself to focus on the transience of the events in the grand
scheme of things. He suggests contemplating the fact that both he and the
person with whom he’s angry will eventually be dead and forgotten. When
viewed from this perspective, it doesn’t seem worth getting flustered by
people’s behavior. Nothing lasts forever. If events will seem trivial in the
future when we look back on them, then why should we care strongly about
them now? This doesn’t mean that we should do nothing. Indeed, by
remaining calm, we can plan our response better and take action. Marcus
didn’t sit on his hands when Cassius instigated the civil war; he rapidly
mobilized a huge army against him. He didn’t allow fear or anger to cloud
his judgment in doing so, however.
The Meditations was likely written before the civil war, but when it
occurred Marcus probably adopted the same philosophical attitude toward
Cassius’s rebellion. Remember that this moment will soon pass, he says,
and things inevitably change.
As we’ll see, the civil war turned out to be very short-lived. There are no
surviving statues of Avidius Cassius. Few people today would even
recognize his name, although he was technically an emperor of Rome,
albeit for just a few months. One day, however, Marcus Aurelius will also
be forgotten. He always kept that in mind when making decisions. He
reminded himself not to worry about how future generations would judge

him but to do only what reason commended as the right course of action.
When we remember that nothing lasts forever, it no longer seems
worthwhile getting angry with other people.
7. IT’S OUR OWN JUDGMENT THAT UPSETS US

It should come as no surprise that Marcus includes perhaps the best-known
Stoic technique of all, which we’ve called cognitive distancing. When
you’re angry, remind yourself that it’s not things or other people that make
you angry but your judgments about them. If you can let go of your value
judgments and stop calling other people’s actions “awful,” then your anger
will diminish. Of course, as Seneca pointed out, there are initial feelings of
anger that we can’t control, which the Stoics call the proto-passions
(propatheiai). We share these emotional reactions to some extent with other
animals, and so they’re natural and inevitable, like the anxiety of the Stoic
teacher whom Gellius described being caught in a storm. Marcus says that
it’s up to you, though, whether you persist in your anger. We don’t control
our initial reaction, perhaps, but we do control how we respond to it: it’s not
what happens first that matters but what you do next.
How can you learn to pause and gain cognitive distance from your initial
feelings of anger rather than being swept along by them? By realizing that
another person’s actions can’t harm your character, Marcus says. All that
really matters in life is whether you’re a good person or a bad person, and
that’s down to you alone. Other people can harm your property or even your
body, but they can’t harm your character unless you allow them to do so. As
Marcus puts it, if you let go of the opinion “I am harmed,” the feeling of
being harmed will disappear, and when the feeling is gone, so is any real
harm.14 Often, though, just reminding yourself that it’s not events that are
making you angry but your judgments about them will be enough to
weaken the hold anger has on you.
8. ANGER DOES US MORE HARM THAN GOOD

Marcus often links gaining cognitive distance with the next technique,
which we’ve called functional analysis. Think about the consequences of
responding with anger and compare them to those of responding rationally,

calmly, and perhaps with empathy and kindness. Alternatively, just remind
yourself that anger actually does you more harm than good. The Stoics
liked to consider how ugly and unnatural anger looks—a scowling face,
grimacing, turning puce with rage, like someone in the throes of a horrible
disease.15 Marcus views the profound ugliness of anger as a sign that it is
unnatural and against reason.
Also, where does anger get us? It’s often totally impotent. Bear in mind,
says Marcus, that men will carry on doing the same things anyway, even if
they cause you to burst with rage.16 Worse, though, our anger is not only
futile but also counterproductive. He notes that it often requires more effort
to deal with the consequences of losing our temper than it does just to
tolerate the very acts with which we’re angry. The Stoics believe that we
take offense because we assume other people’s actions threaten our interests
in some way. However, once you consider that your own anger is a bigger
threat to you than the thing you’re angry about, then you inevitably start to
weaken its grip.
Anger about perceived slights does us more harm than the slights
themselves in an even more fundamental sense, though. The actions of
others are external to us and cannot touch our character, but our own anger
transforms us into a different sort of person, almost like an animal, and for
Stoics that’s the greater harm. Marcus therefore reminds himself that the
vice of another man cannot penetrate your character unless you allow it to
do so. Ironically, anger does the most harm to the person experiencing it,
although he has the power to stop it.17 Your first priority in most cases
should therefore be doing something about your own anger before
attempting to do anything about the events that triggered it.
Throughout The Meditations, Marcus frequently expresses this in
another way, by reminding himself to leave the wrong with the wrongdoer:
“Does another do me wrong? That’s his business, not mine.” He who does
wrong does wrong against himself; he who acts unjustly acts unjustly to
himself, because he harms only himself, he says. The wrongdoer damages
his own character; you shouldn’t join him in his misery by making the value
judgment that he has offended and harmed you too.18

It’s tempting, once again, to imagine that Marcus may have been
thinking of adversaries like Cassius when he warns himself not to feel
toward his enemies as they feel toward him. Likewise, you shouldn’t start to
harbor the sort of opinions the wicked hold or those they wish you to hold.
In short, the best form of revenge is not to sink to their level by allowing
yourself to become angry with them.19 If someone hates you, Marcus says,
that’s their problem. Your only concern is to avoid doing anything to
deserve being hated.
9. NATURE GAVE US THE VIRTUES TO DEAL WITH ANGER

Marcus also recommends applying another familiar Stoic technique to
anger, the one we’ve called contemplation of virtue. You should ask
yourself what virtue or capacity Nature has given you to cope with the
situation you’re facing. There are several closely related questions you
might also ask: How do other people cope with anger? What would your
role models do? What do you admire certain people for doing when faced
with situations that would make others lose their temper? Marcus says that
you should accept that wrongdoing inevitably exists in the world and then
ask, “What virtue has Nature given man as a response to the wrongdoing in
question?” He explains this by comparing virtues to medicines prescribed
by Nature as the “antidotes” to vice.20
The main antidote to anger for Marcus is the Stoic virtue of kindness,
which along with fairness makes up the cardinal social virtue of justice.
Whereas the Stoics viewed anger as the desire to harm others, kindness is
essentially the opposite: goodwill toward others and the desire to help them.
However, what other people do is not strictly up to us, so we should
exercise kindness and goodwill toward others with the reserve clause in
mind, by adding the caveat “Fate permitting.” Like Cato’s archer, a Stoic
should aim at the target (of benefiting others) but be satisfied if he has acted
with kindness, and willing to accept both success and failure with
equanimity.
Marcus actually gives a specific example of what he means, by
describing an imaginary encounter with someone who was testing his
patience with their hostility. He imagines gently encouraging the person in

the right direction by responding along the lines of “No, my son, we have
been made for other things; I shall be in no way harmed, but you are
harming yourself.” Marcus says we should speak to them delicately,
reminding them that human beings are meant to live together in society, like
bees and other communal animals, and not to be at odds with each other.
We should not speak sarcastically or include harsh rebukes but rather reply
with affectionate kindness in our hearts. We should be simple and honest
and not lecture them as though from a schoolmaster’s chair or as though
trying to impress bystanders. It’s tempting again to wonder if Marcus was
thinking how he should talk to men like Cassius, or even his own son
Commodus.
For Stoics, kindness first and foremost means educating others or
wishing they would become wise, free from vice and passion. It’s a desire
to turn enemies into friends, Fate permitting. Marcus’s example of acting
with kindness actually entails educating the other person in two of the most
important strategies he mentioned earlier:
1. Anger does more harm to us than to the person with whom we’re
angry.
2. Humans are essentially social creatures; Nature didn’t intend us to
fight but to help each other.
He views this as another dichotomy: either we can educate the other person
and change their opinions or we can’t. If we can teach them a better way,
then we should do so; if not, we should accept that fact, without anger.
Marcus therefore shows great consideration for the person with whom he’s
angry, and he thinks about tactful ways in which they might be reconciled.
Did he learn this from the way Rusticus and others spoke to him, correcting
his own behavior, when he was a young man?
10. IT’S MADNESS TO EXPECT OTHERS TO BE PERFECT

Marcus describes these first nine strategies as gifts from Apollo’s Muses,
which he says we should take to heart. He adds one more piece of advice
from the Leader of the Muses himself: to expect bad people not to do bad
things is madness because that is wishing for the impossible. Moreover, to

accept their wrongdoing toward others while expecting them never to
wrong you is both inconsiderate and foolish.
This final strategy is about Stoic determinism: the wise man who views
the world rationally is never surprised by anything in life. It’s another
standard type of Stoic argument. We already know that there are both good
men and bad men in the world. Bad men are bound to do bad things.
Therefore, it would be irrational to expect otherwise. “To crave
impossibilities is insanity, but it is impossible for the wicked to act
otherwise.” Wishing bad men never to do wrong is as foolish as wishing
that babies would never cry and becoming angry with them when they do.21
We can easily imagine that Marcus had prepared for Cassius’s betrayal in
this way. The Senate was shocked and caught off guard, and their hasty
reaction just made full civil war more likely. Marcus, by contrast,
responded calmly and confidently, as if he expected these things to happen
in life.
People say “I can’t believe this!” when they’re upset, but usually they’re
describing things that are very common in life, such as betrayal, deceit, or
insults. The Stoics realized that in this sense surprise is not entirely
authentic and needlessly exaggerates our emotional reaction. By contrast,
someone with a more philosophical attitude might say, “That’s no surprise,
these things are bound to happen—c’est la vie.” Marcus tells himself,
“Everything that happens is as usual and familiar as the rose in spring and
the fruit in summer,” including slander and treachery. When we’re surprised
that a bad person acts badly, then we’re to blame for expecting the
impossible.22 We can easily anticipate the sort of wrongs people do, at least
in general terms, but when they actually happen, we behave as if it’s
shocking. You should learn to immediately ask yourself this rhetorical
question when you’re offended by someone’s shameless behavior: “Could it
be that no obnoxious people exist in the world?” Of course not. So
remember not to demand the impossible, and apply this technique to all
forms of wrongdoing. Marcus believes that you will be able to show
kindness toward others if you set aside feigned shock and surprise and
adopt a more philosophical attitude to vice.

Marcus used these ten gifts from Apollo to cope with anger. Throughout
The Meditations he returns again and again to selections from the list:
It is peculiar to man to love even those who do wrong. And this happens, if when they do
wrong it occurs to you that they are kinsmen, and that they do wrong through ignorance and
unintentionally, and that soon both of you will die; and above all, that the wrongdoer has done
you no harm, for he has not made [the character of your mind] worse than it was before.23

Those are clearly tactics derived from the ten gifts of Apollo, as are the
following:
With what are you discontented? The wickedness of men? Take this conclusion to heart, that
rational creatures have been made for one another; that forbearance is part of justice; that
wrongdoing is involuntary; and think how many before now, after passing their lives in
implacable enmity, suspicion, hatred, and at daggers drawn with one another, have been laid
out and burnt to ashes—think of this, I say, and at last stop your fretting.24

However, the strategy Marcus leans on most heavily when coping with
anger is the first gift from Apollo and his Muses: he reminds himself to
view others as his kinsmen, brothers, or sisters, and that Nature meant for
people to work together. We should view even our enemies as part of our
family. It’s our duty to learn how to live in harmony with them so that our
life can go smoothly, even if they try to oppose us.
After listing the ten Gifts from Apollo, though, Marcus also reminds
himself to have this precept at hand when he senses he might lose his
temper: “To be angry is not manly but rather a mild and gentle disposition is
more manly because it is more human.” This is striking because, as we’ve
seen, Cassius reputedly insulted him by calling him a “philosophical old
woman.” He meant to insinuate that Marcus was weak. However, Marcus
believed that in reality someone who is capable of exercising gentleness and
kindness in the face of provocation is stronger and more courageous than
one who gives way to their anger, as Cassius was prone to do. Whereas
people like Cassius often mistake this passionate anger for strength, the
Stoics viewed it as very much a sign of weakness. This brings us back to
our story: What was the outcome of the civil war between Cassius the hawk
and Marcus the dove?

THE MARCH SOUTHEAST AND CASSIUS’S DEATH
By means of daily meditations such as these, Marcus has maintained his
famous composure in the face of Cassius’s rebellion. Philosophy has taught
him to calmly anticipate events such as the appearance of a would-be
usurper. Now, as a Stoic, it is time for him to reconcile acceptance with
action as he marches toward another war far from home. The troops have
gradually come to view him as blessed and divine. They’re genuinely
humbled by the calm demeanor with which he faces adversity—even this,
the greatest in a series of betrayals.
Rome is in a state of hysteria following the news of Cassius’s sedition,
made worse by the Senate’s knee-jerk response. The people are terrified
that Cassius will invade in Marcus’s absence and sack the whole city in
revenge. One of Marcus’s senior officers on the northern frontier, Marcus
Valerius Maximianus, has already been sent racing ahead to engage
Cassius’s legions in Syria with a cavalry regiment twenty thousand strong.
Marcus has also sent the distinguished military commander Vettius
Sabinianus with a detachment from Pannonia to protect the city of Rome in
case the enemy legions advance through Italy.
Cassius seems to be in a strong position at first. With the Syrian legions
under his command and Egypt, the breadbasket of the empire, joining his
cause, others have started to rally behind him. However, support for his
rebellion fails to spread north of Syria. The legions of Cappadocia and
Bithynia both remain fiercely loyal to Marcus Aurelius. Marcus has also
retained the overall support of the Roman Senate. Cassius is left
commanding seven legions: three in Syria, two in Roman Judaea, one in
Arabia, and one in Egypt. However, they amount to less than a third of the
troops still under Marcus’s command throughout the rest of the empire.
Moreover, Marcus’s northern legions are formidable and highly disciplined
veterans, whereas the legions under Cassius are still notoriously weak
despite his draconian attempts to enforce discipline.
Now, precisely three months and six days after Cassius was acclaimed
emperor, as Marcus’s main army marches toward Syria, another messenger
arrives with startling news: While walking through his camp, Cassius was

attacked by a centurion called Antonius, who charged him on horseback and
thrust a blade into his neck as he rode past. Cassius was badly wounded, but
nearly escaped. However, a junior cavalry officer joined the ambush, and
together these two officers hacked off their newly acclaimed emperor’s
head and are on their way to deliver it to Marcus in a bag.
Cassius’s revolt came to this sudden end after his legions discovered that
Marcus was alive and marching against them. Now, several days have
passed, and Antonius and his companion have arrived with the grisly
evidence of the usurper’s demise. Marcus turns them away, refusing to look
at the severed head of a man who was once his friend and ally. He instructs
them to bury it. Although his troops are euphoric, Marcus does not
celebrate. By forgiving the rebel legions, he had inadvertently signed
Cassius’s death warrant. Cassius’s men simply had no more reason to fight
the superior army approaching them from the north. The only thing between
them and their pardon was Cassius, who refused to stand down, and so his
fate was sealed.
Marcus was recognized as sole emperor again throughout the empire by
July 175 AD. Cassius had earned a reputation for being cruel, changeable,
and untrustworthy—and in the end his own men gave him the same callous
treatment that he had shown them over the years. History proved that his
authoritarian approach ultimately backfired. By contrast, Marcus was
known for his constancy and sincerity, and when his legions in Cappadocia
repaid him in kind with their steadfast loyalty, his victory was secured.
Marcus rewarded the Twelfth, known as the Thunderbolt Legion, with the
title Certa Constans (“Surely Constant”) and the Fifteenth, Apollo’s
Legion, with the title Pia Fidelis (“Faithful and Loyal”). Cassius, by
contrast, had tried to frighten and coerce his own men into risking their
lives for him. At the first sign of danger they were bound to turn against
him.
After the civil war in Syria had ended, Marcus did not take severe
measures against Cassius’s family or allies. He only had a handful of men
involved in the plot executed, those who had committed additional crimes.
As agreed, he did not punish the legionaries under Cassius’s command but
sent them back to their usual stations. He also pardoned the cities that had

sided with Cassius. Indeed, Marcus wrote a letter to the “Conscript Fathers”
of the Senate, pleading with them to act with clemency toward those
involved in Cassius’s rebellion. He asked that no senator be punished, that
no man of noble birth be executed, that the exiled should be allowed to
come home, and that goods be returned to those from whom they had been
seized. Accomplices of Cassius were to be protected from any type of
punishment or harm. “Would that I could recall the condemned also from
the grave,” he said. The children of Cassius were to be pardoned, along
with Cassius’s son-in-law and wife, because they had done no wrong.
Marcus went even further and ordered that they were to live under his
protection, free to travel as they pleased, with Cassius’s wealth divided
fairly among them. He wished to be able to say that only those slain during
the rebellion had died as a result of it: there were to be no witch hunts or
acts of revenge afterward. Commodus now accompanied him to Syria and
Egypt, and Marcus commended him to the legions as his official heir before
they finally made their way back to Rome.
Marcus doubtless wanted to restore peace quickly in Rome so that he
could return to the northern frontier, where there was still much work to be
done, so he wisely showed mercy toward those senators who had supported
Cassius. First, though, he found it necessary to tour the eastern provinces to
restore order there. Indeed, his popularity in the east grew considerably as a
result, and we’re even told that the people were inspired to adopt aspects of
his Stoic philosophy.
The Empress Faustina died in spring 176 AD, within half a year of the
revolt’s suppression. There were rumors that she committed suicide because
of her association with Avidius Cassius. She was held in high regard by
Marcus, however, who had her deified after her death. She remained an
immensely popular figure, despite all the loose talk about her alleged
conspiracies. Not long after Faustina’s death, Commodus was appointed
consul, and then in 177 AD, co-emperor with Marcus. Shortly after Marcus’s
death, ignoring his father’s orders for clemency, Commodus would have the
descendants of Cassius hunted down and burned alive as traitors.

8.
DEATH AND THE VIEW FROM ABOVE

Vindobona, March 17, 180 AD. The emperor beckons his guard to come
close and whispers: Go to the rising sun, for I am already setting. He barely
has enough strength to pronounce these words. Marcus glimpses fear in the
young officer’s eyes. The guard hesitates for a moment before nodding
awkwardly and returning to his post at the entrance to the imperial quarters.
Marcus pulls the sheet above his head and rolls over uncomfortably, as if to
go to sleep for the last time. He can feel death beckoning him on all sides.
How easy it would be to slip into oblivion and be free from the pain and
discomfort once and for all. The pestilence is devouring his frail old body
from within. He hasn’t eaten for days, weakening himself by fasting. Now,
as the sun goes down, everything is very quiet. His eyelids flutter, although
the pain keeps him awake. The emperor slips in and out of consciousness.
But he doesn’t die.
He thinks to himself, “Your eyes feel so heavy now—it’s time to let
them close.” The sweet sensation of consciousness dissolving begins to
creep over him …

I must have fallen asleep, or lost consciousness again. I can’t tell if my eyes
are open or closed. Everything is dark. Soon it will be daybreak and the
sparrows will sing their morning song. Spring has broken and the streams

have thawed. Their waters flow into the mighty river passing by the camp
outside.
The soldiers picture the spirit of the Danube as an ancient river god. He
silently offers us all a lesson if only we pause to listen: all things change,
and before long they are gone. You cannot step into the same river twice,
Heraclitus once said, because new waters are constantly flowing through it.
Nature herself is a rushing torrent, just like the Danube, sweeping along all
things in her stream. No sooner has something come into existence than the
great river of time washes it away again, only to carry something else into
view. The long-forgotten past lies upstream from me now, and downstream
waits the immeasurable darkness of the future, vanishing from sight.
I won’t be needing my medicines or physicians again. I’m relieved the
fuss is over. The time has come to let the river wash me away too. Change
is both life and death. We can try to stall the inevitable, but we never escape
it. It’s a fool’s game,
With meats and drinks and magic spells
To turn aside the stream and hold death at bay.1
Looking back, it seems more obvious to me now than ever before that
the lives of most men are tragedies of their own making. Men let
themselves either get puffed up with pride or tormented by grievances.
Everything they concern themselves with is fragile, trivial, and fleeting.
We’re left with nowhere to stand firm. Amid the torrent of things rushing
past, there’s nothing secure in which we can invest our hopes.
You may as well lose your heart to one of the little sparrows who nest by
the riverbank—that’s what I used to say. As soon as it’s charmed you, it will
flit away, vanishing from sight. I once set my heart on my own little
sparrows. I called them my chicks in their nest: thirteen boys and girls,
given to me by Faustina. Now only Commodus and four of the girls are left,
wearing grave faces and weeping for me. The rest were taken before their
time, long ago now. At first I grieved terribly, but the Stoics taught me how
to both love my children and endure when Nature reclaimed them. When I
was mourning my little twin boys, Apollonius patiently consoled me and

helped me slowly regain my composure. It’s natural to mourn—even some
animals grieve the loss of their young. But there are those who go beyond
the natural bounds of grief and let themselves be swept away entirely by
melancholy thoughts and passions. The wise man accepts his pain, endures
it, but does not add to it.
Nature also reclaimed my beloved son Marcus Annius Verus, not long
before my brother Lucius died. I gave him the name I bore myself as a
child, passed down through generations in my family. My little Marcus bled
to death on the doctor’s table while they were removing a tumor from
beneath his ear. I could only mourn him five days before I had to leave
Rome for the war in Pannonia. Later, gentle Apollonius would remind me
of a saying from Epictetus: “Only a madman seeks figs in winter.” Such is
one who pines for his child when his loan has been returned to Nature. I
loved them, by all means, but learned also to accept that they were mortal.
Leaves that the wind scatters to the ground,
Such are the generations of men.2
And what were my children but such leaves? They arrived with the
spring and were brought down by the winter blast; then others grew to take
their place. I wanted to keep them forever, although I always knew that they
were mortal. Yet the heart that cries “Oh let my child be safe!” is like an eye
wanting only to gaze on pleasant sights, refusing to accept that all things
change, whether we like it or not.
The wise man sees life and death as two sides of the same coin. When
Xenophon, one of Socrates’s noblest students, received word that his son
had fallen in battle, what did he say? “I knew my son was mortal.” He
grasped so firmly the precept that what is born must surely also perish. I
had evidence of this from an early age, having lost my father, Annius Verus,
when I was just a child. I barely knew him, except through his reputation as
a good and humble man. My mother, Lucilla, buried him, and in due course
it fell to me to bury her. The Emperor Antoninus, my adoptive father, buried
his empress, and then the time came for Lucius and me, his sons, to place
him in his tomb and mourn for him. Then my brother the Emperor Lucius

died quite unexpectedly, and I buried him too. Finally, I laid to rest my own
beloved empress, Faustina. Soon I shall be reunited with her when
Commodus lays my remains in Hadrian’s great mausoleum on the banks of
the Tiber. My friends will deliver eulogies for me in Rome and remind the
people that Marcus Aurelius has not been lost but only returned to Nature.
The sun sets this evening and takes me down with it; tomorrow it will be
another who rises to take my place.
So now you’re finally here, Death, my old friend, for assuredly I can call
you a friend. You’ve been my guest many times, after all, welcomed
through the gates of my imagination. How often have you accompanied me
as I pictured the reigns of emperors from long ago while deep in my
meditations? Everything is different, but underneath it’s all the same:
anonymous individuals marrying, raising children, falling sick, and dying.
Some fight wars, feast, work the land, and trade their wares. Some flatter
others or seek to be flattered, suspect their fellows of plotting against them,
or hatch their own plots. Countless among them engage in intrigues, pray
for the death of others, grumble at their lot, fall in love, pile up fortunes, or
dream of high office or even a crown. How many individuals whose names
we’ll never know, their lives extinguished, lie forgotten, as if they had never
been born at all? Yet turn your thoughts to the mighty, and what difference
does it make? Death comes knocking at the king’s palace and the beggar’s
shack alike. Augustus, the founder of the empire, his family, ancestors,
priests, advisors, and his whole entourage—where are they now? Nowhere
to be seen. Alexander the Great and his mule driver both reduced to dust,
made equals at last by death.
And what of great dynasties, now utterly extinct? Think of the efforts
their ancestors took to leave behind an heir, only to have their whole lineage
end abruptly with the epitaph “Last of his line” engraved upon some tomb.
And how many cities have, as it were, also died? Entire nations wiped out
from history. Asked why he wasn’t rejoicing at the annihilation of Carthage,
great Scipio wept and prophesied that one day even Rome herself will fall.
Every era of history teaches us the same lesson: nothing lasts forever. From
the court of Alexander, long gone, to those of Hadrian and Antoninus,
among whom I once walked, known today through monuments and stories

only. The very names “Hadrian” and “Antoninus” have acquired an archaic
ring, like the names of Scipio Africanus and Cato of Utica inscribed in
history books. Tomorrow my own name will sound old to others, describing
a bygone era: “the reign of Marcus Aurelius.”
I will be joining them: Augustus, Vespasian, Trajan, and the rest. Yet it is
a thing indifferent to me how or even whether I shall be remembered. How
many of those whose praises were once sung have long since been
forgotten? And those who sang their praises too. It’s vanity to worry about
how history will record your actions. Even now, I’m surrounded by people
who are overly concerned with what future generations will think of them.
They might as well lament the fact that centuries ago, before their birth,
their names were utterly unknown. The lips of mankind can grant you
neither fame nor glory worth seeking. What matters is how I face this
moment, which shall soon be gone, for I can already feel my very self
evaporating, slipping gradually into extinction as if into a dream.
Death, when I rode in triumph through the streets of Rome alongside
Lucius, were you with me then? The slaves stood with us in the chariots,
holding golden wreaths above our heads, whispering at our backs
“remember you must die.” Even as Lucius paraded his haul of gold and
treasures and shackled lines of captured Parthians, his legionaries were
bringing back something far more sinister from the east: the pestilence that
followed them to Rome. It’s taken fourteen years, but the disease that saw
Roman dead piled high on carts has finally claimed another Caesar. The
Stoics taught me to look death square in the eye, to tell myself with
merciless honesty each day “I am a mortal,” all the while remaining in good
cheer. They say that when Zeno, the founder of our school, was elderly, he
once tripped and fell. He banged on the ground and quipped: “I come of my
own accord; why then do you call me?” Now I too am an old man, and,
though you call me, I come readily to meet you, Death.
Yet there are still many afraid even to utter your name aloud. The Stoics
taught me that there are no such words of ill omen. Socrates was the first to
call the idea that death is terrible a mask to frighten small children. He said,
“Friends, if a childish part of you is still afraid of death, you should sing a
charm over him every day until he’s cured.” If I consider death for what it

is, analyzing it rationally, stripping away all the assumptions encrusted
round it, it’s revealed to be nothing but a process of Nature. Look at what is
behind the mask, study it, and you will see it does not bite. Yet this childish
fear of death is perhaps our greatest bane in life. Fear of death does us more
harm than death itself because it turns us into cowards, whereas death
merely returns us to Nature. The wise and good enjoy life, without a doubt,
but nevertheless are unafraid of dying. Surely we are never fully alive as
long as we fear the end? Indeed, to learn how to die is to unlearn how to be
a slave.
I must die, but must I die groaning? For it’s not death that upsets us but
our judgments about it. Socrates did not fear death; he saw that it was
neither good nor bad. On the morning of his execution, he casually
informed his friends that philosophy is a lifelong meditation on our own
mortality. True philosophers, he said, fear their own demise least of all men.
For those who love wisdom above everything else are continually in
training for the end. To practice death in advance is to practice freedom and
to prepare oneself to let go of life gracefully.
Indeed, I have been traveling along the road to death since the very day I
came into this world. From a green grape to a ripened cluster to a shriveled
raisin, everything in Nature has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Each
stage of man has its own ending or demise—childhood, adolescence, prime,
and old age. Assuredly, this body is not the one to which my mother gave
birth. Indeed, I’ve been changing, dying, every day since I was born. If
there is nothing to fear in that, then why should I fear the final step? And if
death is a loss of awareness, then why should I fret? For only that which is
something can be good or evil, but death is nothing, the mere absence of
experience. It’s no worse than sleep. Moreover, death is a release from all
pain, a boundary beyond which our sufferings cannot go. It returns us to
that state of peacefulness in which we lay before we were even born. I was
dead for countless eons before my birth, and it did not vex me then. I was
not; I was; I am not; I do not care—as the Epicureans say.
For if it troubles me not at all that my body only occupies a small portion
of space, then why should I be afraid that it only occupies a small span of
time? In any case, from another point of view, we don’t disappear into

nothingness but are dispersed back into Nature. I shall be returned to the
earth from which my father drew his seed, my mother her blood, my nurse
her milk, and from which I have taken my daily food and drink. For
everything comes ultimately from one source and returns there taking
another form. It is as though from softened wax you might shape a little
horse, then a little tree, then a human form. Nothing is ever really
destroyed, just sent back into Nature’s arms and turned into something else,
over and over—one thing becomes another.
Today a drop of semen, tomorrow a pile of ash or bones. Not eternal, but
mortal; a part of the whole, as an hour is of the day. Like an hour I must
come and like an hour pass away. The more our minds comprehend that we
are parts of the whole in this way, the more we realize our own body’s
frailty. I always reminded myself that I wasn’t meant to live a thousand
years and that death would be here for me soon enough. I lived each day as
if it were to be my last, preparing myself for this very moment. Now that
it’s finally upon me, I realize it’s just the same as every other moment. I
have the choice to die well or die badly. Philosophy has prepared me well
enough. Do you suppose that human life can seem any great matter, said
Socrates, to a great-souled individual who has embraced the whole of time
and the whole of reality in his thoughts? No. To such a person not even
death will seem terrible.
My soul disperses for a while, in drowsy reveries, teetering on the brink
of insensibility. What a miraculous power thought has to travel swiftly
across the world, or to consume grand vistas, enveloping more and more
within its scope. Roaming dreamily over the whole wide world and bidding
it farewell, I realize that I have taken flight above it. Like Homer’s Zeus,
looking down on earth from Mount Olympus, observing now the lands of
the horse-loving Thracians, now Greece, Persia, India, and surrounding
everything the wine-dark sea. Or like our Scipio Aemilianus, who,
slumbering in Numidia, dreamt that he was transported aloft, allowed to
gaze down briefly on the world of men from among the stars.
I have long prepared my mind to embrace the most comprehensive
outlook through the daily practice of philosophy. Plato said anyone seeking
to understand human affairs should gaze down upon all earthly things this

way, as though from a high watchtower. Each day I would rehearse, just as
my teachers did, imagining myself suddenly raised aloft and looking down
on the complex tapestry of human life from high above. Now, as the life
keeps fading from my body, my daydreams turn into visions, real enough to
touch. How insignificant the countless things men squabble over seem from
this high vantage point. Like children, though, who think only of what
baubles belong to their play, men, their minds captivated by narrow fears
and desires, are alienated from Nature as a whole.
I can see them now below me, the great herds of human animals:
numerous workers toiling in the fields, far-traveled merchants of all nations,
and huge armies massed for battle—all of them like ants scuttling over the
earth. Always busy at something, an anonymous, swarming mass,
wandering astray down the countless labyrinthine paths that stretch before
them. Men, women, and children, slaves and nobles, those being born and
those dying, marrying and separating, celebrating festivals and mourning
their losses; the tiresome clapping of tongues in courts of law—I see a
hundred thousand faces of friends and strangers pass me by. I see great
cities growing from humble settlements, thriving for a spell, then one day
crumbling into deserted ruins. Races barbarous in their infancy, struggling
toward civilization, then falling into barbarism again; after darkness and
ignorance come arts and sciences, then the inevitable descent once again
into darkness and ignorance. I see exotic and undiscovered races hidden in
the far corners of the world. The many different rituals, languages, and
stories of men. The countless lives of others long ago and the lives that will
be lived many years from now after my own demise. And even though I
was fated to be acclaimed the emperor of Rome, how few there are in the
vast world who have even heard my name, let alone known me for who I
really am. Those who do will soon be gone themselves and forgotten.
I find myself marveling once more at the soul’s capacity to rid itself of
myriad unnecessary troubles in this way. Enlarging itself, embracing the
whole universe, and reflecting on the finitude and transience of all
individual things, the brevity of our entire life, and the lives of others, when
compared to the eternity of time. We become magnanimous, great-souled,
by expanding our minds and rising above trivial things, which belong far

beneath us. The soul flies free when it’s not weighed down by earthly fears
and desires and returns to its homeland, a citizen of the entire cosmos,
making its abode the immeasurable vastness of universal Nature.
Thanks be to the gods that I was encouraged to make a habit of picturing
the whole cosmos thus, and contemplating the immensity of both time and
space. I learned to set each particular thing in life against the whole
substance of the universe in my mind’s eye and see it as far less than a fig
seed, and measure it against the whole of time as nothing more than the turn
of a screw. For what is impossible to see with mortal eyes is nevertheless
possible to grasp with the intellect.
Before me now a mental image forms: the representation of a shining
sphere enclosing all creation, each part distinct but nevertheless one,
gathered into a single vision. All the stars of the heavens, the sun, the moon,
our earth, both land and sea, and all living creatures, just as though seen
within a transparent globe, which I can almost imagine holding in the palm
of my hand. From this cosmic perspective, in truth, to rail against the
universe in fury over all the troubles in history would be like weeping over
a cut on my smallest finger.
My life all but over, nothing remains—no fears and no desires to
separate me from the rest of Nature. I see before me the whole of the
cosmos, its vast design, and the mighty revolutions performed by the
celestial orbs. And I find myself plunged deep in this imagination,
traversing the heavens above, as strength leaves my limbs.
In this vast ocean of being, what a minute dot our whole earth seems.
Asia and Europe in their entirety are merely specks of dirt, the great oceans
nothing but a raindrop, and the highest mountain merely a grain of sand.
I can only admire the grace and majesty of the stars as my mind is
blessed to accompany them, and I marvel further still at the vision of the
whole cosmos before me. May I be transformed through the proximity of
death into something worthy of Nature and the cosmos, an alien in my
motherland no more. Traveling through the breadth of Nature, my mind
expands to a vastness that envelops individual events, swallowing them up
and making them appear like a pinpoint by comparison. Where is the
tragedy in such negligible incidents? Where is the surprise or astonishment?

What I spent my life learning I now see everywhere—as I turn my
attention from one thing to another, all sides grant me the same vision. The
universe is a single living being, with a single body and a single
consciousness. Every individual mind a tiny particle of one great mind.
Each living creature like a limb or organ of one great body, working
together, whether they realize it or not, to bring about events in accord with
one great impulse. Everything in the universe so intricately woven together,
forming a single fabric and chain of events. Whereas I once saw each
fragmentary part and with some effort imagined the whole, my sight is now
transformed. Having let go of fear and desire forever, I can see only the
whole to which every part belongs, and this appears more real to me than
anything else. What I knew before, my life and opinions, seem like smoke
through which I glimpsed Nature darkly.
Rejoicing in this comprehensive vision, my self is dilated until it
becomes one with infinite universal Nature. How minuscule the fraction of
cosmic time that has been assigned to each of our lives. How small this clod
of earth over which we creep. The more confidently I grasp this vision, the
more clearly I understand that nothing is of any great moment in life except
that we should do two simple things: First we must follow the guidance of
our own higher nature, submitting ourselves to reason’s dictates. Second,
we must deal wisely and dispassionately with whatever universal Nature
sends to be our fate, whether pleasure or pain, praise or censure, life or
death.
My soul ascends higher as the remaining life now ebbs from my limbs.
The difference between knowing and seeing has somehow given way.
Before my very gaze, the constellations surround me, like those adorning
the walls in the temples of Mithras. I glide effortlessly alongside them like a
ship sailing over the smoothest waters. Around me are the multitude of
stars, a host of beings composed of pure light. Naked and flawless, they
gracefully follow their course through the heavens without deviation. How
they differ from men below on earth. We possess the same divine spark, yet
it lies buried deep within us, and we live as though imprisoned, anchored
down in the mud by our own folly and greed.

The mind of the Sage is like a star or our own sun, from which purity
and simplicity shine forth. I’ve been fortunate enough to observe these
characteristics in others. Men like Apollonius, Junius Rusticus, and
Claudius Maximus by their own example showed me how to live wisely,
virtuously, and in accord with Nature. Released now from earthly
attachments, I feel my soul being transformed and cleansed, unveiling
within me some glimmer of the deep wisdom that I once glimpsed in the
words and actions of my beloved teachers. As I let life slip away, content to
part from it, my mind is finally liberated to follow its own true nature
without obstruction. I see things more clearly than ever before. The sun
does not do the work of the rain or of the wind.
The sun himself and every star in heaven are telling me, “I was born to
do what I am doing.” And I too was born to follow my own nature by
striving for wisdom. Countless stars punctuate the night sky. Each one is
distinct from the others, yet they all work together, forming the whole
panoply of heaven. Man was meant to be like this: striving his whole life
with patient endurance to cultivate the pure light of wisdom within himself
and allowing it to shine forth for the benefit of others. Alone and yet at one
with the community of fellow men around him, living wisely and in
concord with them. The ancient Pythagoreans were right. To contemplate
the unwavering purity and simplicity of the stars in this way is to cleanse
our mind of earthly dross and set it free.
The rays of Apollo pour down in every direction but are not exhausted.
Extending itself, sunlight touches objects and illuminates them without
being weakened or defiled. It rests where it falls, caressing objects and
exposing their features, neither deflected like the wind nor absorbed like the
rain. Indeed, the mind of the wise man is itself like a heavenly sphere
radiating the purest sunlight. It falls gracefully upon things, illuminating
them without becoming entangled or degraded by them. For what does not
welcome the light condemns itself to darkness. In the mind of one who has
been purified, though, nothing is veiled or hidden.
Pure wisdom like the blazing fire of a sun consumes anything cast into it
and burns brighter still. Reason adapts itself to any obstacle if it’s allowed
to, finding the right virtue with which to respond. We have been given a

duty of sorts to take care of this paltry body with its unruly feelings, but
only our intellect is genuinely our own. We let go of our attachment to
everything external, purifying and separating ourselves from things, when
we firmly grasp the realization that they are transient and ultimately
indifferent. When we cut our ties to the past and the future and center
ourselves in the present moment, we set our soul free from external things,
leaving it to invest itself wholly in fulfilling its own nature.
Things external to our own character such as health, wealth, and
reputation are neither good nor bad. They present us with opportunities,
which the wise man uses well and the fool badly. Though men desire wealth
and other such things, these no more improve a man’s soul than a golden
bridle improves a horse. We contaminate ourselves with these externals,
blending and merging into things when we confuse them with our soul’s
natural good. Rising above indifferent things, the mind of the wise becomes
a well-rounded sphere, as Empedocles used to say. It neither overreaches
itself, mingling with external things, nor shrinks away from them. Its light
spreads evenly over the world around it. Complete in itself, smooth and
round, bright and shining. Nothing clings to its surface and no harm can
touch it.
I can still feel the pain over there in my body. That part of me that still
lies bleeding and shuddering beneath the bedsheet. It seems very far away
now. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest. Soon another lapse into
unconsciousness will come. I think it will be the last one. And so I bid
farewell to myself, in good cheer, not begrudging the loss. I take one last
step forward to meet Death, not as an enemy but as an old friend and
sparring partner. Clenching my fists gently and bracing myself against the
unknown and unforeseen, I arm myself once more with the precepts of my
philosophy:
The duration of a man’s life is merely a small point in time; the substance of it ever flowing
away, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to decay.
His soul is a restless vortex, good fortune is uncertain and fame is unreliable; in a word, as a
rushing stream so are all things belonging to the body; as a dream, or as vapor, are all those that
belong to the soul.
Life is warfare and a sojourn in a foreign land. Our reputation after life is nothing but
oblivion. What is it then that will guide man? One thing alone: philosophy, the love of wisdom.

And philosophy consists in this: for a man to preserve that inner genius or divine spark
within him from violence and injuries, and above all from harmful pains or pleasures; never to
do anything either without purpose, or falsely, or hypocritically, regardless of the actions or
inaction of others; to contentedly embrace all things that happen to him, as coming from the
same source from whom he came himself, and above all things, with humility and calm
cheerfulness, to anticipate death as being nothing else but the dissolution of those elements of
which every living being is composed.
And if the elements themselves suffer nothing by this, their perpetual conversion of one into
another, that dissolution, and alteration, which is so common to them all, why should it be
feared by any man? Is this not according to Nature? But nothing that is according to Nature can
be evil.3

It must be nearing dawn outside but I can no longer tell. My eyes have
grown so feeble, surrounded by darkness on every side. I won’t live to see
another sunrise. It doesn’t matter.

the Modern Stoicism organization for sharing their ideas with me over the
years and for helping me to arrive at my interpretation of Stoicism.
